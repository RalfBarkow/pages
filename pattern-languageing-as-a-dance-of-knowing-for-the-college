        "text": "Pattern language is a design approach to complex lived situations, developed in the 60s and 70s by a group around architect Chris Alexander ::\\[Alexander xxxx]::. Alexander’s pattern language engaged the design of urban and interior space, a span from regional planning to the detail design of interiors, through to the in-situ construction of buildings, addressing this as a hierarchy of physical space, open to more and less direct intervention in any individual design-and-build project. Higher in the hierarchy, spaces - and the lives lived in those spaces - were clearly subject to evolution over generations, while spaces and dimensions of living low in the hierarchy were open to relatively direct transformations.\n\nA pattern in Alexander’s pattern language is a written description, within a formal, standardised standardised frame or proforma (one aspect of pattern), of a design challenge and its resolution. This is set in an explicit context of other patterns on both a larger and smaller scale (another aspect of pattern, constituting a weave or an ecology of patterns) which together constitute an elegantly liveable and workable setting (a landscape, as much as a language) which bears an evolutionary, continuing, relationship to many previous recognisable responses to that same kind of challenge of lived-in space (a third aspect of pattern). These same characteristics need to be given to a pattern language for making a living economy; that is, for enacting an *activist life* of intentional transformation, event-by-event, movement-by-movement. A foprop pattern language - the basis of the curriculum of a college of formacion - needs a formal frame centred on a *recurring challenge* and its self-consciously radical practical resolution; an ecology of patterns on different *degrees of granularity or scope*; and an evolutionary basis in which patterns are recognised, refined and self-consciously mobilised, across *generations of practice* or across *multiple locations* in the course of the uneven historical development of the hegemonic system and its radical transformative responses.\n\nThus the proforma or template for a pattern in a foprop pattern language has these elements:\n- A description of a central problem (actually, contradiction) to be resolved in practice, expressed in terms of relations of production and *altered relations of production*. A simple visual schema to represent this is a good indication that the issue has been clearly framed. This element of the pattern language is critical. On one hand the ’targeting’ of specific hegemonic relations of production guarantees the significance of a pattern, and on the other, historical instances of alternative relations of production (see the ‘history’ element, next) demonstrate that other modes of resourcing, visioning and commitment are in practice available: ‘There is an alternative’. Although there are differing views in the pattern language tradition, regarding the value of ‘anti-patterns’, it makes sense here for this to be the core, since we are trying to get to the roots of a still-emergent *anti-practice*: a historical transformation, whose traditions and contemporary instances  are not necessarily very old or stable. That is what formacion is *about*.\n- A summary history of handling such challenges, and insights arising (this might be seen as the ‘R&D’ basis of the pattern); *summarised, referenced and instantiated* within the pattern description. A resonant, evocative, instantiating image also is a great help.\n- A brief evocative or memorable name . Alexander’s pattern language, at the level of pattern names, reads like a Whitmanesque, *invocatory poem or song*; an assembly of patterns related to the resolution of a particular challenge reads almost like a synopsis of a drama, or a celebratory hymn.\n- Identification of other patterns in the language/repertoire that *contextualise* this one (greater in scope or preceding in time); and\n- Other patterns that detail and particularise this one, making it more fully *liveable, workable, enactable and inhabitable*.\n\nIn terms of the dance of knowing, an effective pattern accomplished several things.  The first is *conceptualising*: in terms of conditions, human and non-human actors, affiliations and resonances, and crucially, relations of production. The second is *narrative framing*: in the history. A third is *rigorous abstraction*: arriving at a characterisation of the challenge and its resolution that generalises sufficiently from the particulars of its many instances, mobilises an ontology that is consistent across patterns, and thus articulates with other patterns as a system of descriptions of an inhabitable practical world. The foprop weave provides the frame for abstraction. And fourth - in a sensitive balance with rigorous abstraction - real, rigorous, *poetic* skill: intuiting a coherent, recognisable pattern in a multitude of experiences and in history, finding it an evocative name, and articulating pattern-descriptions in sufficiently poetic language, so that patterns can be ‘sung’ back into the stream of life-practice: in consort . . like a chorus, like a situated improvisation by a well-rehearsed company, like the way that the director of a play might ‘give notes’ after a performance.\n\nOverall, a pattern language needs to be a little formalised: having a workable number of discrete patterns, simply retrievable and connectable with one another on a regular pattern, with each pattern following a standard format - but carrying unique, evocative and empirical content. ‘Evoking’ is perhaps the basic work that a pattern repertoire needs to be designed to do; so the dance across all the quadrants is vital.\n\nAs written descriptions - elements of ‘a language’ - patterns sit above the line in the dance-of-knowing schema. But as below-the-line *performances* of knowing, in which patterns are skilfully recognised and mobilised, it’s the practice of pattern language(ing) that comes to the fore. The *genre* of developing and mobilising patterns involves pods of collaborative work, between pattern-stewards (members of the schools of the college) and members of partner organisations (coops, civil-society organisations, municipal administrations, social enterprises, etc): activists in making the living economy. These two categories are by no means disjunct (we would expect members of the college to be economy-making activists too, alongside the political economy of the college itself); but in the facilitative, co-production practice of the college - in pods - the roles are distinct. Pod practice is a form of ‘circle’ practice: a cousin of study circles (important in feminist culture, in *Capital* reading groups and in the culture of Afro-American cooperation, for example ::\\[Nembhard xxx]::), of action-learning sets ::\\[Checkland xxx]::, of design circles ::\\[Vehvilainen xxx; Hales and O’Hara xxx; Greenbaum & Kyng xxx; Cottam xxx; Design Justice xxx]::) Further aspects of genre, constituting an institutional culture of pattern-based production of activist literacy, and commons of both patterns and capability, are significant in college practice too: see the next section.\n\nThe other below-the-line quadrant - *skill* - is perhaps less central with regard to patterns. But a repertoire of documented descriptions, evolving over time and across distributed communities of researcher-developers into a commons, and mobilised fluently through retrieval and setting-alongside one another and sharing, calls for a whole field of skill . . in document handling and curating and, probably, some specialised tools: probably digital; and in that case, well-architected and well-operated as P2P infrastructure; quite possibly, built on a distributed hypertext software architecture like federated wiki ::\\[http://mh.federated.wiki]::.\n\nPattern language is a demanding, sophisticated and relatively new cultural form (emerging from the 60s ‘systems’ aesthetic), and there have been many variants since the original collection of 253 space-creation patterns ::\\[Hales 2018, constructs xxx]::, some quite casual and some rather rigorous in their architecture ::\\[http://2020college.federated.wiki/pattern-languageing.html]::. One of the most interesting ones with regard to activist practice and economic transformation is  *Liberating Voices - A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution* \\[Schuler 2020 xxx https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/liberating-voices, http://newyork.thecityatlas.org/lifestyle/the-green-new-deal-is-the-real-deal/] which is an aspect of the Public Sphere Project for civic intelligence \\[https://publicsphereproject.org/]. foprop is unusually rigorous in its framing, and is a language of quite a different kind than Alexander’s: of quite different purposes, engaging quite different material. Alexander was able to adopt an obvious ‘out-there’ hierarchy of physical scale as the frame; foprop adopts a phenomenological pseudo-hierarchy of ¿zones of reach, founded on an ontology of three §landscapes that inhere in practice per se. While Alexander’s is a pattern language of experiential impacts of inert built environment which make it feel alive, foprop is theory of *praxis*, framed for the situation-to-situation construction of *activist life* within history.\n\nThe foprop pattern language takes a necessary and decisive step beyond an organisation-design or culture-design toolkit, of the kind that was assembled in the Young Foundation collections *Social venturing* and *The open book of social innovation*, referred to earlier. It does this by adopting a ‘principled’ framing of historical engagement: forces of production (richly conceptualised as weaves of concrete practice), self-consciously organised and reorganised and animated under relations of production, by cultural and economic formations. At the same time, as a ‘design patterns’ approach, pattern language is kin to the kind of work Robin did in connection with the Design Centre and the Young Foundation around twelve years ago, and in particular, seems quite close to the ‘Ten principles’ he tantalisingly identified in DaO.\n\nBelow are four examples of patterns that can be anticipated to figure in the pattern repertoire of the college. The summaries are necessarily sketchy; and all of the patterns call for the validation and curating of a well-constituted *commons of pattern language(ing) capability*, as stewarding of the college begins to operate, the Faculties begin to knuckle down to the challenges of livelihood and infrastructure, and the federated Schools begin their collaborative, trans-generational, intersectional, cultural and aesthetic labour. I’ll include a pattern from each faculty of the college, and each of them derives from a focus of Robin’s.\n\n*Fairtrade visiting* in the Faculty of formacion work\nThe *School of festivals and visiting* will need a pattern that evokes what Robin spoke of as ’networking’, in a 2009 conference presentation [Murray 2009 video xxx] where he displayed half a dozen of the many cultural and geographical locations within the fairtrade value-chain that he personally had been instrumental in connecting together through visits and mutual hospitality. Another instance of this pattern is the solidarity exchange that was negotiated in the 60s between previously isolationist (black) US and (white) UK musicians’ unions by Ronnie Scott (of Soho jazz club fame).  ‘The support principle' that Robin identifies in DaO lives in this faculty of the college too, as an instance of healthy capability and self-reliance, fostered through dedicated, skilled and *remunerated* facilitation.\n\n*Zero waste* in the Faculty of subsistence work\nThe *School of feral nature* stewards many patterns related to life and work ‘within the doughnut’ that Kate Raworth identified as a space of urgent experimentation in comfortable and sufficient existence, above ‘the social foundation’ and below ‘the planetary ceiling’. Raworth’s doughnut schema furnishes the ‘process map’ for landscape §1, which this faculty engages with. A zero waste pattern (perhaps a small cluster of more detailed patterns) evokes practice such as this, from Robin’s ‘zero waste principle’ in DaO:\n> Recycling and reuse are only one segment of an emerging industrial model involving the extension of product life, lowering repair costs through the modularisation of design, the re-skinning of old products, disassembly and the re-use of parts, re-refining of oils, re-sterilisation (of plastic tubing in hospitals) re-treading of tyres (with higher quality treads), the move to leasing . . \\[Initially in waste management], but also the maintenance of public buildings and equipment, the re-use of hospital equipment, the use of consumer durables through collaborative services . .\n‘Right to repair’ is a related ‘detailing’ pattern. From among Robin's DaO Ten principles, the 'social property principle' (School of law) and The Wõrgl principle (School of alternative money) need their patterns stewarded in this Faculty too.\n\n*Festival of value(ing)* in the Faculty of care work\nThe *School of livelihood and contribution* needs a pattern that invokes large-scale giving on Robin’s ‘Church spire principle’ from DaO:\n>. .  ambitious collective projects \\[of crowdfunding] . . sub-divided into innumerable pockets of activity  . . united by purpose . . \\[O]rganising such common endeavours is a creative art in itself . . sub-divided by municipality, locality, workplace or school using common metrics and a central resource of advice and information.\nBut these need to be organised as events that construct an active, explicit *aesthetic commons*, of value(ing), opposition, and mutual recognition and communicating, rather than as a simple-minded, self-congratulatory celebration of presumed ‘shared’ or ‘social’ values, or ‘simple’ generosity. Developing (as a dance of genre, skill, conceptualisation and story) the distinction between ‘values’ and tribal bonding, on one hand, and (skilful, intentional practices of) value(ing) and affiliating, on the other, lies at the heart of this faculty of the college.\n\n*Dancers in the region* in the  Faculty of stewarding\nThe *School of dual power* needs a small family of patterns that evoke qualities of practice that were explored in the mix at the 1980s’ GLC: a ‘dance’ of contributions involving . . *in-&-against the state* (as an aesthetic of staff within the regional, taxation-funded, administrative authority) . . plus *roots project development* (as a conscious extension of the funding of ‘making’ and strategising activity in community voluntary sector organisations) . . plus *roots campaign facilitation* (by skilled facilitator-activists on the staff of the regional authority) . . plus *socially useful productivity* released through funding and restructuring of enterprises and sectors by the regional development bank: a rough calculation implied that 35,000,000 hours of prime *wage-work time* needed to be mobilised *each week* in ’strategy and operations for labour’, to countervail the weight of labour mobilised by capital in London ::\\[Hales 1984, Paid to think xxx]::.\n\nSee below for an anticipatory map of schools (pattern families) in the Faculty of formacion work. The dance-of-knowing schema is the ‘process map’ for the §2 cultural landscape, which is engaged by this faculty. The dance of knowing, as a conceptual frame, is a container for an important element of the curriculum of a college of formacion: a theory of the practice of capable knowing. But pattern language(ing), as *practice* in the college, *is* the dance. Thus the School of pattern language(ing) is one of the schools that has an important dual, reflexive role: not only as a facilitator of making the living economy, but also as provider and steward of infrastructure within the college itself."

Thus the School of pattern language(ing) is one of the schools that has an important dual, reflexive role: not only as a facilitator of making the living economy, but also as provider and steward of infrastructure within the college itself."

        "text": "In terms of the dance of knowing, an effective pattern accomplished several things.  The first is *conceptualising*: in terms of conditions, human and non-human actors, affiliations and resonances, and crucially, relations of production. The second is *narrative framing*: in the history. A third is *rigorous abstraction*: arriving at a characterisation of the challenge and its resolution that generalises sufficiently from the particulars of its many instances, mobilises an ontology that is consistent across patterns, and thus articulates with other patterns as a system of descriptions of an inhabitable practical world. The foprop weave provides the frame for abstraction. And fourth - in a sensitive balance with rigorous abstraction - real, rigorous, *poetic* skill: intuiting a coherent, recognisable pattern in a multitude of experiences and in history, finding it an evocative name, and articulating pattern-descriptions in sufficiently poetic language, so that patterns can be ‘sung’ back into the stream of life-practice: in consort . . like a chorus, like a situated improvisation by a well-rehearsed company, like the way that the director of a play might ‘give notes’ after a performance.\n\nOverall, a pattern language needs to be a little formalised: having a workable number of discrete patterns, simply retrievable and connectable with one another on a regular pattern, with each pattern following a standard format - but carrying unique, evocative and empirical content. ‘Evoking’ is perhaps the basic work that a pattern repertoire needs to be designed to do; so the dance across all the quadrants is vital.\n\nAs written descriptions - elements of ‘a language’ - patterns sit above the line in the dance-of-knowing schema. But as below-the-line *performances* of knowing, in which patterns are skilfully recognised and mobilised, it’s the practice of pattern language(ing) that comes to the fore. The *genre* of developing and mobilising patterns involves pods of collaborative work, between pattern-stewards (members of the schools of the college) and members of partner organisations (coops, civil-society organisations, municipal administrations, social enterprises, etc): activists in making the living economy. These two categories are by no means disjunct (we would expect members of the college to be economy-making activists too, alongside the political economy of the college itself); but in the facilitative, co-production practice of the college - in pods - the roles are distinct. Pod practice is a form of ‘circle’ practice: a cousin of study circles (important in feminist culture, in *Capital* reading groups and in the culture of Afro-American cooperation, for example ::\\[Nembhard xxx]::), of action-learning sets ::\\[Checkland xxx]::, of design circles ::\\[Vehvilainen xxx; Hales and O’Hara xxx; Greenbaum & Kyng xxx; Cottam xxx; Design Justice xxx]::) Further aspects of genre, constituting an institutional culture of pattern-based production of activist literacy, and commons of both patterns and capability, are significant in college practice too: see the next section.\n\nThe other below-the-line quadrant - *skill* - is perhaps less central with regard to patterns. But a repertoire of documented descriptions, evolving over time and across distributed communities of researcher-developers into a commons, and mobilised fluently through retrieval and setting-alongside one another and sharing, calls for a whole field of skill . . in document handling and curating and, probably, some specialised tools: probably digital; and in that case, well-architected and well-operated as P2P infrastructure; quite possibly, built on a distributed hypertext software architecture like federated wiki ::\\[http://mh.federated.wiki]::.\n\nPattern language is a demanding, sophisticated and relatively new cultural form (emerging from the 60s ‘systems’ aesthetic), and there have been many variants since the original collection of 253 space-creation patterns ::\\[Hales 2018, constructs xxx]::, some quite casual and some rather rigorous in their architecture ::\\[http://2020college.federated.wiki/pattern-languageing.html]::. One of the most interesting ones with regard to activist practice and economic transformation is  *Liberating Voices - A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution* \\[Schuler 2020 xxx https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/liberating-voices, http://newyork.thecityatlas.org/lifestyle/the-green-new-deal-is-the-real-deal/] which is an aspect of the Public Sphere Project for civic intelligence \\[https://publicsphereproject.org/]. foprop is unusually rigorous in its framing, and is a language of quite a different kind than Alexander’s: of quite different purposes, engaging quite different material. Alexander was able to adopt an obvious ‘out-there’ hierarchy of physical scale as the frame; foprop adopts a phenomenological pseudo-hierarchy of ¿zones of reach, founded on an ontology of three §landscapes that inhere in practice per se. While Alexander’s is a pattern language of experiential impacts of inert built environment which make it feel alive, foprop is theory of *praxis*, framed for the situation-to-situation construction of *activist life* within history.\n\nThe foprop pattern language takes a necessary and decisive step beyond an organisation-design or culture-design toolkit, of the kind that was assembled in the Young Foundation collections *Social venturing* and *The open book of social innovation*, referred to earlier. It does this by adopting a ‘principled’ framing of historical engagement: forces of production (richly conceptualised as weaves of concrete practice), self-consciously organised and reorganised and animated under relations of production, by cultural and economic formations. At the same time, as a ‘design patterns’ approach, pattern language is kin to the kind of work Robin did in connection with the Design Centre and the Young Foundation around twelve years ago, and in particular, seems quite close to the ‘Ten principles’ he tantalisingly identified in DaO.\n\nBelow are four examples of patterns that can be anticipated to figure in the pattern repertoire of the college. The summaries are necessarily sketchy; and all of the patterns call for the validation and curating of a well-constituted *commons of pattern language(ing) capability*, as stewarding of the college begins to operate, the Faculties begin to knuckle down to the challenges of livelihood and infrastructure, and the federated Schools begin their collaborative, trans-generational, intersectional, cultural and aesthetic labour. I’ll include a pattern from each faculty of the college, and each of them derives from a focus of Robin’s.\n\n*Fairtrade visiting* in the Faculty of formacion work\nThe *School of festivals and visiting* will need a pattern that evokes what Robin spoke of as ’networking’, in a 2009 conference presentation [Murray 2009 video xxx] where he displayed half a dozen of the many cultural and geographical locations within the fairtrade value-chain that he personally had been instrumental in connecting together through visits and mutual hospitality. Another instance of this pattern is the solidarity exchange that was negotiated in the 60s between previously isolationist (black) US and (white) UK musicians’ unions by Ronnie Scott (of Soho jazz club fame).  ‘The support principle' that Robin identifies in DaO lives in this faculty of the college too, as an instance of healthy capability and self-reliance, fostered through dedicated, skilled and *remunerated* facilitation.\n\n*Zero waste* in the Faculty of subsistence work\nThe *School of feral nature* stewards many patterns related to life and work ‘within the doughnut’ that Kate Raworth identified as a space of urgent experimentation in comfortable and sufficient existence, above ‘the social foundation’ and below ‘the planetary ceiling’. Raworth’s doughnut schema furnishes the ‘process map’ for landscape §1, which this faculty engages with. A zero waste pattern (perhaps a small cluster of more detailed patterns) evokes practice such as this, from Robin’s ‘zero waste principle’ in DaO:\n> Recycling and reuse are only one segment of an emerging industrial model involving the extension of product life, lowering repair costs through the modularisation of design, the re-skinning of old products, disassembly and the re-use of parts, re-refining of oils, re-sterilisation (of plastic tubing in hospitals) re-treading of tyres (with higher quality treads), the move to leasing . . \\[Initially in waste management], but also the maintenance of public buildings and equipment, the re-use of hospital equipment, the use of consumer durables through collaborative services . .\n‘Right to repair’ is a related ‘detailing’ pattern. From among Robin's DaO Ten principles, the 'social property principle' (School of law) and The Wõrgl principle (School of alternative money) need their patterns stewarded in this Faculty too.\n\n*Festival of value(ing)* in the Faculty of care work\nThe *School of livelihood and contribution* needs a pattern that invokes large-scale giving on Robin’s ‘Church spire principle’ from DaO:\n>. .  ambitious collective projects \\[of crowdfunding] . . sub-divided into innumerable pockets of activity  . . united by purpose . . \\[O]rganising such common endeavours is a creative art in itself . . sub-divided by municipality, locality, workplace or school using common metrics and a central resource of advice and information.\nBut these need to be organised as events that construct an active, explicit *aesthetic commons*, of value(ing), opposition, and mutual recognition and communicating, rather than as a simple-minded, self-congratulatory celebration of presumed ‘shared’ or ‘social’ values, or ‘simple’ generosity. Developing (as a dance of genre, skill, conceptualisation and story) the distinction between ‘values’ and tribal bonding, on one hand, and (skilful, intentional practices of) value(ing) and affiliating, on the other, lies at the heart of this faculty of the college.\n\n*Dancers in the region* in the  Faculty of stewarding\nThe *School of dual power* needs a small family of patterns that evoke qualities of practice that were explored in the mix at the 1980s’ GLC: a ‘dance’ of contributions involving . . *in-&-against the state* (as an aesthetic of staff within the regional, taxation-funded, administrative authority) . . plus *roots project development* (as a conscious extension of the funding of ‘making’ and strategising activity in community voluntary sector organisations) . . plus *roots campaign facilitation* (by skilled facilitator-activists on the staff of the regional authority) . . plus *socially useful productivity* released through funding and restructuring of enterprises and sectors by the regional development bank: a rough calculation implied that 35,000,000 hours of prime *wage-work time* needed to be mobilised *each week* in ’strategy and operations for labour’, to countervail the weight of labour mobilised by capital in London ::\\[Hales 1984, Paid to think xxx]::.\n\nSee below for an anticipatory map of schools (pattern families) in the Faculty of formacion work. The dance-of-knowing schema is the ‘process map’ for the §2 cultural landscape, which is engaged by this faculty. The dance of knowing, as a conceptual frame, is a container for an important element of the curriculum of a college of formacion: a theory of the practice of capable knowing. But pattern language(ing), as *practice* in the college, *is* the dance. Thus the School of pattern language(ing) is one of the schools that has an important dual, reflexive role: not only as a facilitator of making the living economy, but also as provider and steward of infrastructure within the college itself."

        "text": "Overall, a pattern language needs to be a little formalised: having a workable number of discrete patterns, simply retrievable and connectable with one another on a regular pattern, with each pattern following a standard format - but carrying unique, evocative and empirical content. ‘Evoking’ is perhaps the basic work that a pattern repertoire needs to be designed to do; so the dance across all the quadrants is vital.\n\nAs written descriptions - elements of ‘a language’ - patterns sit above the line in the dance-of-knowing schema. But as below-the-line *performances* of knowing, in which patterns are skilfully recognised and mobilised, it’s the practice of pattern language(ing) that comes to the fore. The *genre* of developing and mobilising patterns involves pods of collaborative work, between pattern-stewards (members of the schools of the college) and members of partner organisations (coops, civil-society organisations, municipal administrations, social enterprises, etc): activists in making the living economy. These two categories are by no means disjunct (we would expect members of the college to be economy-making activists too, alongside the political economy of the college itself); but in the facilitative, co-production practice of the college - in pods - the roles are distinct. Pod practice is a form of ‘circle’ practice: a cousin of study circles (important in feminist culture, in *Capital* reading groups and in the culture of Afro-American cooperation, for example ::\\[Nembhard xxx]::), of action-learning sets ::\\[Checkland xxx]::, of design circles ::\\[Vehvilainen xxx; Hales and O’Hara xxx; Greenbaum & Kyng xxx; Cottam xxx; Design Justice xxx]::) Further aspects of genre, constituting an institutional culture of pattern-based production of activist literacy, and commons of both patterns and capability, are significant in college practice too: see the next section.\n\nThe other below-the-line quadrant - *skill* - is perhaps less central with regard to patterns. But a repertoire of documented descriptions, evolving over time and across distributed communities of researcher-developers into a commons, and mobilised fluently through retrieval and setting-alongside one another and sharing, calls for a whole field of skill . . in document handling and curating and, probably, some specialised tools: probably digital; and in that case, well-architected and well-operated as P2P infrastructure; quite possibly, built on a distributed hypertext software architecture like federated wiki ::\\[http://mh.federated.wiki]::.\n\nPattern language is a demanding, sophisticated and relatively new cultural form (emerging from the 60s ‘systems’ aesthetic), and there have been many variants since the original collection of 253 space-creation patterns ::\\[Hales 2018, constructs xxx]::, some quite casual and some rather rigorous in their architecture ::\\[http://2020college.federated.wiki/pattern-languageing.html]::. One of the most interesting ones with regard to activist practice and economic transformation is  *Liberating Voices - A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution* \\[Schuler 2020 xxx https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/liberating-voices, http://newyork.thecityatlas.org/lifestyle/the-green-new-deal-is-the-real-deal/] which is an aspect of the Public Sphere Project for civic intelligence \\[https://publicsphereproject.org/]. foprop is unusually rigorous in its framing, and is a language of quite a different kind than Alexander’s: of quite different purposes, engaging quite different material. Alexander was able to adopt an obvious ‘out-there’ hierarchy of physical scale as the frame; foprop adopts a phenomenological pseudo-hierarchy of ¿zones of reach, founded on an ontology of three §landscapes that inhere in practice per se. While Alexander’s is a pattern language of experiential impacts of inert built environment which make it feel alive, foprop is theory of *praxis*, framed for the situation-to-situation construction of *activist life* within history.\n\nThe foprop pattern language takes a necessary and decisive step beyond an organisation-design or culture-design toolkit, of the kind that was assembled in the Young Foundation collections *Social venturing* and *The open book of social innovation*, referred to earlier. It does this by adopting a ‘principled’ framing of historical engagement: forces of production (richly conceptualised as weaves of concrete practice), self-consciously organised and reorganised and animated under relations of production, by cultural and economic formations. At the same time, as a ‘design patterns’ approach, pattern language is kin to the kind of work Robin did in connection with the Design Centre and the Young Foundation around twelve years ago, and in particular, seems quite close to the ‘Ten principles’ he tantalisingly identified in DaO.\n\nBelow are four examples of patterns that can be anticipated to figure in the pattern repertoire of the college. The summaries are necessarily sketchy; and all of the patterns call for the validation and curating of a well-constituted *commons of pattern language(ing) capability*, as stewarding of the college begins to operate, the Faculties begin to knuckle down to the challenges of livelihood and infrastructure, and the federated Schools begin their collaborative, trans-generational, intersectional, cultural and aesthetic labour. I’ll include a pattern from each faculty of the college, and each of them derives from a focus of Robin’s.\n\n*Fairtrade visiting* in the Faculty of formacion work\nThe *School of festivals and visiting* will need a pattern that evokes what Robin spoke of as ’networking’, in a 2009 conference presentation [Murray 2009 video xxx] where he displayed half a dozen of the many cultural and geographical locations within the fairtrade value-chain that he personally had been instrumental in connecting together through visits and mutual hospitality. Another instance of this pattern is the solidarity exchange that was negotiated in the 60s between previously isolationist (black) US and (white) UK musicians’ unions by Ronnie Scott (of Soho jazz club fame).  ‘The support principle' that Robin identifies in DaO lives in this faculty of the college too, as an instance of healthy capability and self-reliance, fostered through dedicated, skilled and *remunerated* facilitation.\n\n*Zero waste* in the Faculty of subsistence work\nThe *School of feral nature* stewards many patterns related to life and work ‘within the doughnut’ that Kate Raworth identified as a space of urgent experimentation in comfortable and sufficient existence, above ‘the social foundation’ and below ‘the planetary ceiling’. Raworth’s doughnut schema furnishes the ‘process map’ for landscape §1, which this faculty engages with. A zero waste pattern (perhaps a small cluster of more detailed patterns) evokes practice such as this, from Robin’s ‘zero waste principle’ in DaO:\n> Recycling and reuse are only one segment of an emerging industrial model involving the extension of product life, lowering repair costs through the modularisation of design, the re-skinning of old products, disassembly and the re-use of parts, re-refining of oils, re-sterilisation (of plastic tubing in hospitals) re-treading of tyres (with higher quality treads), the move to leasing . . \\[Initially in waste management], but also the maintenance of public buildings and equipment, the re-use of hospital equipment, the use of consumer durables through collaborative services . .\n‘Right to repair’ is a related ‘detailing’ pattern. From among Robin's DaO Ten principles, the 'social property principle' (School of law) and The Wõrgl principle (School of alternative money) need their patterns stewarded in this Faculty too.\n\n*Festival of value(ing)* in the Faculty of care work\nThe *School of livelihood and contribution* needs a pattern that invokes large-scale giving on Robin’s ‘Church spire principle’ from DaO:\n>. .  ambitious collective projects \\[of crowdfunding] . . sub-divided into innumerable pockets of activity  . . united by purpose . . \\[O]rganising such common endeavours is a creative art in itself . . sub-divided by municipality, locality, workplace or school using common metrics and a central resource of advice and information.\nBut these need to be organised as events that construct an active, explicit *aesthetic commons*, of value(ing), opposition, and mutual recognition and communicating, rather than as a simple-minded, self-congratulatory celebration of presumed ‘shared’ or ‘social’ values, or ‘simple’ generosity. Developing (as a dance of genre, skill, conceptualisation and story) the distinction between ‘values’ and tribal bonding, on one hand, and (skilful, intentional practices of) value(ing) and affiliating, on the other, lies at the heart of this faculty of the college.\n\n*Dancers in the region* in the  Faculty of stewarding\nThe *School of dual power* needs a small family of patterns that evoke qualities of practice that were explored in the mix at the 1980s’ GLC: a ‘dance’ of contributions involving . . *in-&-against the state* (as an aesthetic of staff within the regional, taxation-funded, administrative authority) . . plus *roots project development* (as a conscious extension of the funding of ‘making’ and strategising activity in community voluntary sector organisations) . . plus *roots campaign facilitation* (by skilled facilitator-activists on the staff of the regional authority) . . plus *socially useful productivity* released through funding and restructuring of enterprises and sectors by the regional development bank: a rough calculation implied that 35,000,000 hours of prime *wage-work time* needed to be mobilised *each week* in ’strategy and operations for labour’, to countervail the weight of labour mobilised by capital in London ::\\[Hales 1984, Paid to think xxx]::.\n\nSee below for an anticipatory map of schools (pattern families) in the Faculty of formacion work. The dance-of-knowing schema is the ‘process map’ for the §2 cultural landscape, which is engaged by this faculty. The dance of knowing, as a conceptual frame, is a container for an important element of the curriculum of a college of formacion: a theory of the practice of capable knowing. But pattern language(ing), as *practice* in the college, *is* the dance. Thus the School of pattern language(ing) is one of the schools that has an important dual, reflexive role: not only as a facilitator of making the living economy, but also as provider and steward of infrastructure within the college itself."

For example . . . \n- The *conceptualising* quadrant runs from disciplined speaking using rigorously curated vocabularies (and hopefully, their underpinning ontologies), through a limited degree of schematising and formalising (as with pattern language, below), through ‘hard, quants’ methodology such as the quantitative-experimental, ‘evidence-based’ discipline (or fetish) that is generally taken to characterise ‘real science’; into domains of highly abstracted and formalised code: mathematics, formal logic, software code. At the extreme, and as a current norm, the attention and enthusiasm given to translations into the formal domains is never matched by attention to the skills and genres of translation *back out* again, into ‘everyday language’ and ontology; thus these highly valued (over-valued) rigours are far more limited than they claim to be.\n- The *storytelling* quadrant runs from undisciplined gossip (where ‘rigour’ is minimal and highly informal, resting in ‘trust’ and senses of ‘authenticity’), through skilled storytelling - for example, by bards or griots - within traditions of literary, historical, mythological or folk genre, into journalism (news from elsewhere) of more and less rigorous kinds; into historical and strategic narrative (also news from elsewhere) founded in firm conceptualisations rather than rhetorical flows whose terms skip from one meaning to another in a button-pushing play of memes.\n- The *genre* quadrant contains the ‘how we do things around here’ that ‘everybody’ knows (so commonplace no-one speaks about it until it is violated), shared habit and regularly frequented venues (in families, in informal communities; also in marketing-targeted segments of population, in psyops, large-scale bombing raids and ethnic cleansing); running through explicit norms and forms (in formal organisations - which are never the *actual* relations of how stuff gets done, but rather, formal grounds of formal legitimacy and approval), and into durable institutions that are cemented by (or constituted as) substantial infrastructures of material resource, and thus as durable extensive *powers*. The identification of actual genre - as distinct from commonplace *stories about* professed genre - is an extremely skilful business, the province of ethnographers and ethnomethodologists; and great organisers.\n- The skill quadrant runs across direct, in-the-moment relations with all sorts of material stuff: from manual craft skill (generally mediated by small-scale, human-powered, hands-on tools), through the handling and curating of historical or current documents to maintain them in useable and really-useful constellations; through ‘operational’ relationships with extended material systems (generally mediated by extended machineries of tools); right down into into skill with one’s own body (as in Olympic gymnasts for example, and people with physical disability) and finally into the skilful handling (in-here, now) of ‘the feeling of what happens’ ::(Damasio xxx):: in the formation and mobilising of affect and intention; this is the territory of landscape §3. \n\nIt’s notable that ‘skill’ somehow seems to be the root word for all modes of rigour, it frequently can refer to any of them. In the dhamma frame of buddhism, the central principle is ‘skilful’ awareness and response. Struggles of ‘deskilling’ and reskilling have been the foundation of ‘labour process’ politics in the baby-boomer generation. The etymology of skill seems to be connected with doing things ‘well’, and with common *weal*. Tradition and community are always a condition of ‘skill’; skill is never a simply individual capacity.\n\nThe dance-of-knowing schema thus furnishes a mapping-space for multiple and distinct ’rigours’. The crucial thing about the schema, though, is that it recognises that no practice of knowing and organising is in fact conducted without there being a dance, into and out of and across the quadrants, above- and below-the-line, left-side and right-side; and that there is then also a pivotal family of ‘meta-rigours’ to do with the skilful performing and choreographing of *the dance*. I would say these choreographic capabilities tend to be quite rare: a formation (or a person) is rather likely to make a home in one or other quadrant: “every carpenter thinks that wood is the greatest thing”; equally, a person whose familiar tool is a hammer may treat everything as if it were a nail. Very many people love to be in the storytelling quadrant (in a pretty slack kind of way); we certainly are narrative animals, there is always ‘something ongoing’ that warrants story-sharing. It’s my view that these insights and choreographic principles of the dance of knowing are pivotal in the construction and conduct of any skilful, systematic practice of formacion.\n\nSkill in the dance of knowing is central for any practice of skilfully producing well-organised, well-understood activist formations, with well-founded and skilfully mobilised understandings and skills. Notably . .\n- Rigorous (disciplined, aesthetically defined, well-moderated) *conceptualising*; including the legitimate reach into (and the return loop *back-from*) licensed ‘geek domains’ of nicely-moderated and grounded formalisation and codification;\n- Full-scope, multivocal, time- and place-spanning *narrative* (and narrative traditions); well-domesticated and licensed memes, tropes grounded in explicit ontology. No sophistry, no gossip;\n- Well-rehearsed *genres* and traditions of genre, with recognised venues and participation; rigorously legitimated and transparently governed institutions; and\n- Vernacular *skills*; finely tuned working relationships with well-selected and -organised systems of material means (‘tools’, material infrastructures, media, physical stuff, human and non-human bodies).\nA college of activist literacy must teach these; and must *do* these, and be organised to do them, well. The college is fundamentally the walk, not simply the talk; the ‘hidden’ curriculum is primary. Some of the schools of the college are especially important in furnishing and stewarding these capabilities *within* the college.\n\nThe literacy of this dance is held in the pattern families that are stewarded by the schools in the Faculty of formacion work . . see below.\n\nGiven that the formalised rigour of code and formal machine-performable scripts (as software code, as algorithm) is a particularly powerful - and problematic - feature of the dance of knowing in the present century, it warrants a note, following."

So, as a way of illustrating what patterns in the foprop language might handle, I'll pick up some threads from Robin's 'Ten principles' in DaO.\n\n"
