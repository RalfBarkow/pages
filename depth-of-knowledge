The model was developed by Norman Webb in the late 1990s and has since been widely used in education to help teachers design more effective instruction and assessments.\n\nThe DOK model defines four levels of cognitive complexity, with each level requiring a progressively higher level of thinking skills:\n\n    Level 1: Recall and Reproduction - Tasks at this level require students to recall or reproduce previously learned information, such as facts, definitions, or simple procedures.\n\n    Level 2: Skills and Concepts - Tasks at this level require students to apply knowledge and skills to new situations or to demonstrate understanding of key concepts.\n\n    Level 3: Strategic Thinking - Tasks at this level require students to engage in more complex reasoning and problem-solving, such as making connections between different ideas or analyzing and evaluating information.\n\n    Level 4: Extended Thinking - Tasks at this level require students to engage in more sophisticated and abstract thinking, such as conducting research, designing experiments, or creating original works. The aspiration of this level is referred to as [[DoK4]]."
