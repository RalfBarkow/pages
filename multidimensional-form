Interpretation will remain constant as the boundary representation is transcribed across dimensions, from 1D strings to 2D icons to 3D architectures to 4D temporal experiences. There is no abstract/concrete dichotomy, so that boundary languages are much easier to understand. No mind/body split, so boundary forms are much easier to tolerate. In contrast, string encoding cannot be experienced, it must be learned via memorization. Consequently string languages remain necessarily [[cerebral]]. Mathematical nominalism holds that mathematics is about objects that exist. Container languages provide nominalistic consistency by requiring that concepts too have a manifest [[Form]]."

The printed page limits representation to symbolic and iconic forms, but by projecting volumetric forms onto paper, we can approximate concrete and experiential languages. The image of a box can elicit imagination of a box. Leibniz: “The best signs are images; and words, insofar as they are adequate, should represent images accurately.” ([[Leibniz]] to Tschirnhaus, end of 1679 (Math., IV, 481; Brief., I, 405), as quoted in L.

Interpretation will remain constant as the boundary representation is transcribed across dimensions, from 1D strings to 2D icons to 3D architectures to 4D temporal experiences. There is no abstract/concrete dichotomy, so that boundary languages are much easier to understand. No mind/body split, so boundary forms are much easier to tolerate. In contrast, string encoding cannot be experienced, it must be learned via memorization. Consequently string languages remain necessarily cerebral. Mathematical nominalism holds that mathematics is about objects that exist. Container languages provide nominalistic consistency by requiring that concepts too have a manifest form."
