      "text": "\"The One Who Didn't Shoot\" (\"I'm Not Fooling You...\") is a song by Vladimir Vysotsky about the Great Patriotic War. It was written presumably in late 1972 - early 1973, and was publicly performed for the first time on January 30, 1973. During the poet's lifetime, the poem was published in 1977 in Paris in the collection Songs of Russian Bards. In the USSR for the first time it was published on May 8, 1987 in the newspaper \"Soviet Russia\", the first record of the song was released by \"Melody\" in 1989.\n\nMany factors and circumstances influenced the creation of the song, including the memories of Vysotsky's relatives and friends. A certain influence on the poetics of the work was exerted by the popular postwar wagon parody \"I was a battalion scout\", as well as by the poems of the front-line poets Mikhail Kulchitsky, Semyon Gudzenko and David Samoilov, which were included in the Taganka Theater's play \"The Fallen and the Living\". These authors, like Vysotsky, were primarily interested in \"Man and War\" from a moral and philosophical point of view. The song, whose protagonist survived a firing squad, reveals the poet's most important problem of human moral choice. The work belongs to the conventional group of Vysotsky's texts \"The First Step\", when the deed of the one \"who did not shoot\" goes against the usual norms of social behavior. "

      "text": "The hero of the song, for whom the story is sung, is sentenced to be shot for a reason that \"I don't know, but I can't tell. The soldier was under the watchful eye of \"the indefatigable Special Forces [Comm. 1] Suetin,\" when one day he failed to carry out a mission to capture and deliver a \"tongue. Neither his fellow officers nor even his commander could save him from being shot by a court-martial verdict. \"Nobody could do anything about it,\" the hero of the song says, and then adds: \"No. There was one who couldn't shoot.\" During the execution of the sentence, he manages to survive, which he sees as a credit to the fighter who did not shoot (the original author's version of the song had the stanza - \"I was not shot because / There was one who did not shoot\")[3]. 3] According to the hero, the repeated shooting did not happen, because \"the statutes do not allow one to be shot twice\"[Comment 2]. When the surgeon in the infirmary removed the bullets from the hero of the song with surprise and \"tongue-tapping,\" he was mentally conversing with \"the kid who did not shoot\"[5]. The author recounts the tragedy of the event in a deliberately ironic style: \"I licked my wounds like a dog, / I did not cure them, / I was highly honoured in hospitals, though. // The whole weak female sex was in love with me: / \"Hey you, unshot, / Let's have a shot!\"[6]. During his treatment, the fighter sent packages of \"glucose\" to his battalion, which was \"heroic in the Crimea,\"[Comment 3] \"so that it would be sweeter to fight\" to a fellow soldier who had not followed orders. At the end of the narrative, when the narrator returns to his regiment after treatment, tragedy strikes. The man who was able to defy circumstances is killed, and with it the world of the hero of the song, who has found his salvation thanks to him, collapses: \"The German sniper shot me down, - / Killing the one who did not shoot\"[7].

      "text": "Vladimir Vysotsky very rarely dated his manuscripts, so researchers of his works establish the approximate date of writing by indirect ways. In the case of the song \"The One Who Did Not Shoot\", most researchers date its first public performance to January 30, 1973, at a concert at Leningrad School No. 213[8]. 8] Based on this date, they suppose that the song was written in the end of 1972[9]. In the memoirs of the poet Peter Vegin there is an account of a meeting with Vysotsky at the Taganka Theatre in 1973. In between rehearsals and the showing of \"Ten Days That Shook the World\", Vysotsky, who took part in it, gave an interview to the Polish translator Liliana Korotkova. In one of the episodes of that meeting Vysotsky sang the song \"I don't powder your brains...\" and said that he had only finished it that morning[10]. In the chronology of events described by Fyodor Razzakov, Vysotsky's appearance on stage in the play Ten Days That Shook the World is mentioned only once in early 1973, on January 11[8].\n\nSemyon Vladimirovich Vysotsky, the poet's father, recalled that his front-line friends often came to their house and Volodya listened to their stories about the war for hours from his childhood. One of the recordings keeps Vysotsky's story that he heard the story for the song \"The one that didn't shoot\" from his father's brother Alexey Vladimirovich. He had been an artilleryman through the war,[12] and told many frontline stories. The battalion under the command of his combat friend held the defense in the reefs, and the combat formation was flawed - the flanks were open. A message about it to the command was intercepted by German troops, and they intensified the attack. The battalion commander gave the order for the battalion to retreat and diverted the battalion from its positions, in violation of the command directive. In spite of his past military merits and decorations he was sentenced to execution for this episode, but the order was not carried out due to escalation of combat operations and great losses of the battalion. According to Vysotsky, when a song based on these events was ready, he sang it to a family friend, and the latter said: \"Yes, it was. That's right. It was, it was, it was...\"[3][13]. "

      "text": "In the first version of the poem, the third and fourth lines were missing, and the first stanza looked like this: \"Why is this path - / I'll answer the question: / Because I got the language, and I didn't get it\"[3]. In the spring of 1973, Vysotsky replaced one line in the lyrics of the song. If previously the \"main villain\" of the song had been called \"the special officer Suetin\", now it was \"the strange type Suetin\". The word \"osobist\" was removed from the song due to the author's reluctance to hurt the Chekists unnecessarily[14]. Though Vysotsky sang the new version in all his public performances after 1973, there is a non-public recording of this song in 1975 in the studio of Mikhail Shemyakin in Paris where the line is sung in its original version. According to Andrey Krylov, this confirms the conclusion that the change of the line was caused not by creative, but by autocensorship considerations[15].\n\nIn the last year of his life, the song \"He Who Wasn't Shooting\" was performed by Vysotsky at his concerts, the second in order. The first song he performed was \"Brother's Graves\"[16]. The author's last known performance of this song was on July 16, 1980,[17]. "

        "text": "The hero of the song, for whom the story is sung, is sentenced to be shot for a reason that \"I don't know, but I can't tell. The soldier was under the watchful eye of \"the indefatigable Special Forces [Comm. 1] Suetin,\" when one day he failed to carry out a mission to capture and deliver a \"tongue. Neither his fellow officers nor even his commander could save him from being shot by a court-martial verdict. \"Nobody could do anything about it,\" the hero of the song says, and then adds: \"No. There was one who couldn't shoot.\" During the execution of the sentence, he manages to survive, which he sees as a credit to the fighter who did not shoot (the original author's version of the song had the stanza - \"I was not shot because / There was one who did not shoot\")[3]. 3] According to the hero, the repeated shooting did not happen, because \"the statutes do not allow one to be shot twice\"[Comment 2]. When the surgeon in the infirmary removed the bullets from the hero of the song with surprise and \"tongue-tapping,\" he was mentally conversing with \"the kid who did not shoot\"[5]. The author recounts the tragedy of the event in a deliberately ironic style: \"I licked my wounds like a dog, / I did not cure them, / I was highly honoured in hospitals, though. // The whole weak female sex was in love with me: / \"Hey you, unshot, / Let's have a shot!\"[6]. During his treatment, the fighter sent packages of \"glucose\" to his battalion, which was \"heroic in the Crimea,\"[Comment 3] \"so that it would be sweeter to fight\" to a fellow soldier who had not followed orders. At the end of the narrative, when the narrator returns to his regiment after treatment, tragedy strikes. The man who was able to defy circumstances is killed, and with it the world of the hero of the song, who has found his salvation thanks to him, collapses: \"The German sniper shot me down, - / Killing the one who did not shoot\"[7].

        "text": "Vladimir Vysotsky very rarely dated his manuscripts, so researchers of his works establish the approximate date of writing by indirect ways. In the case of the song \"The One Who Did Not Shoot\", most researchers date its first public performance to January 30, 1973, at a concert at Leningrad School No. 213[8]. 8] Based on this date, they suppose that the song was written in the end of 1972[9]. In the memoirs of the poet Peter Vegin there is an account of a meeting with Vysotsky at the Taganka Theatre in 1973. In between rehearsals and the showing of \"Ten Days That Shook the World\", Vysotsky, who took part in it, gave an interview to the Polish translator Liliana Korotkova. In one of the episodes of that meeting Vysotsky sang the song \"I don't powder your brains...\" and said that he had only finished it that morning[10]. In the chronology of events described by Fyodor Razzakov, Vysotsky's appearance on stage in the play Ten Days That Shook the World is mentioned only once in early 1973, on January 11[8].\n\nSemyon Vladimirovich Vysotsky, the poet's father, recalled that his front-line friends often came to their house and Volodya listened to their stories about the war for hours from his childhood. One of the recordings keeps Vysotsky's story that he heard the story for the song \"The one that didn't shoot\" from his father's brother Alexey Vladimirovich. He had been an artilleryman through the war,[12] and told many frontline stories. The battalion under the command of his combat friend held the defense in the reefs, and the combat formation was flawed - the flanks were open. A message about it to the command was intercepted by German troops, and they intensified the attack. The battalion commander gave the order for the battalion to retreat and diverted the battalion from its positions, in violation of the command directive. In spite of his past military merits and decorations he was sentenced to execution for this episode, but the order was not carried out due to escalation of combat operations and great losses of the battalion. According to Vysotsky, when a song based on these events was ready, he sang it to a family friend, and the latter said: \"Yes, it was. That's right. It was, it was, it was...\"[3][13].

        "text": "In the first version of the poem, the third and fourth lines were missing, and the first stanza looked like this: \"Why is this path - / I'll answer the question: / Because I got the language, and I didn't get it\"[3]. In the spring of 1973, Vysotsky replaced one line in the lyrics of the song. If previously the \"main villain\" of the song had been called \"the special officer Suetin\", now it was \"the strange type Suetin\". The word \"osobist\" was removed from the song due to the author's reluctance to hurt the Chekists unnecessarily[14]. Though Vysotsky sang the new version in all his public performances after 1973, there is a non-public recording of this song in 1975 in the studio of Mikhail Shemyakin in Paris where the line is sung in its original version. According to Andrey Krylov, this confirms the conclusion that the change of the line was caused not by creative, but by autocensorship considerations[15].\n\nIn the last year of his life, the song \"He Who Wasn't Shooting\" was performed by Vysotsky at his concerts, the second in order. The first song he performed was \"Brother's Graves\"[16]. The author's last known performance of this song was on July 16, 1980,[17]. "
