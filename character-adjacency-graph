This paper describes a multi-channel approach to open-set cross-domain authorship attribution (AA) for the PAN-CLEF 2019 AA shared task. The present work adapts the EACH-USP ensemble method presented at PAN-CLEF 2018 to an open-set scenario by deﬁning a threshold value for unknown authors, and extends the previous architecture with an additional character ranking model built with the aid of the PageRank algorithm. Results are superior to a number of baseline systems, and remain generally comparable to those in the original closed-set ensemble approach.\n"
