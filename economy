ISBN 978-3-462-00255-3. Demokratie und Wohlstand, ein längeres Leben, mehr Gleichberechtigung und Bildung: Der Kapitalismus hat viel Positives bewirkt. Zugleich ruiniert er jedoch Klima und Umwelt, sodass die Menschheit nun existenziell gefährdet ist. “Grünes Wachstum” soll die Rettung sein, aber Wirtschaftsexpertin und Bestsellerautorin Ulrike Herrmann hält dagegen: Verständlich und messerscharf erklärt sie in ihrem neuen Buch, warum wir stattdessen “grünes Schrumpfen” brauchen. Die Klimakrise verschärft sich täglich, aber konkret ändert sich fast nichts. Die Treibhausgase nehmen ungebremst und dramatisch zu. Dieses Scheitern ist kein Zufall, denn die Klimakrise zielt ins Herz des Kapitalismus. Wohlstand und Wachstum sind nur möglich, wenn man Technik einsetzt und Energie verbrennt. Leider wird die Ökoenergie aus Sonne und Wind aber niemals reichen, um weltweites Wachstum zu befeuern. Die Industrieländer müssen sich also vom Kapitalismus verabschieden und eine Kreislaufwirtschaft anstreben, in der nur noch verbraucht wird, was sich recyceln lässt. Aber wie soll man sich dieses grüne Schrumpfen vorstellen? Das beste Modell ist ausgerechnet die britische Kriegswirtschaft ab 1940. „Herrmanns Buch ist historisch lehrreich und gut zu lesen. Es zeigt auf, wo technologische Limitationen der Klimawende liegen. Doch es wirkt dabei deterministisch. Herrmann erkennt an, dass Menschen in der Vergangenheit viele Probleme gelöst haben. Sie bezweifelt aber offenbar, dass das dieses Mal auch so sein wird“ (deutschlandfunk.de). Platz 9 der Sachbuch-Bestenliste für November 2022.
