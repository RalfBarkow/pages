With the progressive functionalization of people in the modern working society and the resulting loss of subjectivity, Arendt simultaneously sees individuality as isolation and thus as a problem. She decisively criticizes this \"peculiar individualization\". For Adorno, the decisive problem is not individualization, but the disintegration and transformation of individuality in modern society from a residuum of potential freedom to \"indifference to the individual\": \"Everyone is only what he can replace everyone else with: fungible, a specimen. He himself, as an individual, is the absolutely replaceable, the pure nothing.\" The individual is of central importance for Adorno's theory in general."

In it, he deals primarily with the differentiation of politics as an autonomous system of modern society. Luhmann still attributes the process of differentiation itself to role differentiation. In substance, however, his main focus is on the analysis of purely factual criteria of suitability and performance, which can only be negotiated immanently to the system, and which are used to fill and evaluate political roles (Luhmann 1968)."

Luhmann, for example, remained true to himself in no longer attaching the concept of politics to the traditional sense of Aristotelian terminology, because Aristotle's political society is no longer our society. One also encounters the same sequence of differentiation, autonomy, and functional specification with which Luhmann had approached the political system since 1968. Even the differentiation of the political system qua offices, i.e., via role differentiation, reappears, and even in determining the autonomy of the political system, Luhmann again addresses the function of the political system to produce collectively binding decisions. There is no doubt that Luhmann's political sociology shows certain constants over all these years."

      "text": "A remarkable \"innovation (or perhaps just: specification)\" compared to 1968, as Luhmann (PolG, 15) put it, comes into play at the point where he raises the question of how political communication can be recognized. How, then, does the political system recognize the membership of system-specific communications, when there are countless other communications in society that are not political in nature? Luhmann does resume his classic question about the self-determination of the political system, i.e., about the system-specific ability to set selective criteria for intercourse with the environment itself and to change them as needed. However, due to the higher demands Luhmann had set for himself in the course of the autopoietic turn, especially when it comes to the operation-specific (self-)identification of social systems, a much more precise determination of these criteria was now needed than seemed necessary or possible at the beginning."

Specifically, the book comprises eleven chapters: 1. the politics of society, 2. the medium of power, 3. the differentiation and operational closure of the political system, 4. political decision-making, 5. the memory of politics, 6. the state of the political system, 7. political organizations, 8. public opinion, 9. self-descriptions, 10. structural couplings, 11. political evolution. Given the scarcity of space, not all aspects can be addressed. The central issues are power and violence, function and decision of the political system, and the political coding 'government' and 'opposition'."

For Adorno, the decisive problem is not individualization, but the disintegration and transformation of individuality in modern society from a residuum of potential freedom to \"indifference to the individual\": \"Everyone is only what he can replace everyone else with: fungible, a specimen. He himself, as an individual, is the absolutely replaceable, the pure nothing.\" The individual is of central importance for Adorno's theory in general.\n"

Luhmann, for example, remained true to himself in no longer attaching the concept of politics to the traditional sense of Aristotelian terminology, because Aristotle's political society is no longer our society. One also encounters the same sequence of differentiation, autonomy, and functional specification with which Luhmann had approached the political system since 1968. Even the differentiation of the political system qua offices, i.e., via role differentiation, reappears, and even in determining the autonomy of the political system, Luhmann again addresses the function of the political system to produce collectively binding decisions. There is no doubt that Luhmann's political sociology shows certain constants over all these years."

        "text": "A remarkable \"innovation (or perhaps just: specification)\" compared to 1968, as Luhmann (PolG, 15) put it, comes into play at the point where he raises the question of how political communication can be recognized. How, then, does the political system recognize the membership of system-specific communications, when there are countless other communications in society that are not political in nature? Luhmann does resume his classic question about the self-determination of the political system, i.e., about the system-specific ability to set selective criteria for intercourse with the environment itself and to change them as needed. However, due to the higher demands Luhmann had set for himself in the course of the autopoietic turn, especially when it comes to the operation-specific (self-)identification of social systems, a much more precise determination of these criteria was now needed than seemed necessary or possible at the beginning."
