A very old philosopher Aristotle, once said, _\"Educating the mind without educating the heart, is no education at all.\"_ Humanity and Integrity remind us that schools are a work of not just the mind, but also the heart. Grit reminds us every day that success is a result of commitment and determination, often with challenge. At Griffin State School the essence of this and what we stand for has been captured in our school song _Hearts and Minds_.\n"
