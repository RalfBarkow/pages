I think there is a growing backlash over the move to long identifiers with everything spelled out. I find myself using the Shift key (and retyping long identifiers) more and more in 'modern' development shops. How much faster would I be if I could just call 'nIndex' what I really want to call it ('i')? The flow of my job tasks would be more coherent than the finger-twisting development experience that contemporary practices encourage. I can also see where [[Pair Programming]] could really exacerbate this issue. Now there are two people participating in this supposedly beneficial process of conglomerating natural language words into something 'meaningful.' Inevitably, even more conglomeration will occur, assuming the participants are following modern guidelines (e.g. what Microsoft suggests for C#). All of this is quixotic, in my experience. People call the same things by many different names, and what's intuitive for one programmer seems strange to another. It's very difficult to really come up with something that will resonate with programmers in general (many of whom are not native English speakers), and too much time is perhaps being wasted in this pursuit. Long, [[Camel Case]] variable names designed by a committee-of-two seem to me to have the tendency to quickly become a nuisance, and I think it's such studious variable-naming that's mocked by this page.</i> --[[Beau Wilkinson]]",

I think there is a growing backlash over the move to long identifiers with everything spelled out. I find myself using the Shift key (and retyping long identifiers) more and more in 'modern' development shops. How much faster would I be if I could just call 'nIndex' what I really want to call it ('i')? The flow of my job tasks would be more coherent than the finger-twisting development experience that contemporary practices encourage. I can also see where [[Pair Programming]] could really exacerbate this issue. Now there are two people participating in this supposedly beneficial process of conglomerating natural language words into something 'meaningful.' Inevitably, even more conglomeration will occur, assuming the participants are following modern guidelines (e.g. what Microsoft suggests for C#). All of this is quixotic, in my experience. People call the same things by many different names, and what's intuitive for one programmer seems strange to another. It's very difficult to really come up with something that will resonate with programmers in general (many of whom are not native English speakers), and too much time is perhaps being wasted in this pursuit. Long, [[Camel Case]] variable names designed by a committee-of-two seem to me to have the tendency to quickly become a nuisance, and I think it's such studious variable-naming that's mocked by this page.</i> --[[Beau Wilkinson]]",
