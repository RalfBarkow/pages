His conclusion that the model cannot work by trial and error alone is wonderful and his conclusion that only learning can shorten the time to regain homeostasis is also great. It seem that his analysis would and does apply to my two favorite tetrahedrons: https://marc.relocalizecreativity.net/view/experimenting-with-tetrahedrons \nand http://marc.tries.fed.wiki/view/tetrahedron-social-system.
