      "text": "Election officials and security experts in the U.S. are concerned that conspiracy theories related to the 2020 presidential election could encourage interference with, or even attempts to sabotage, voting machines during this fall's elections. Such concerns were highlighted on the last day of voting in the Pueblo County, CO, June primary, when a poll worker found an error message on a voting machine's screen. Election officials can take measures to ensure unauthorized devices don't infect voting equipment, by for example, configuring systems to recognize only proprietary devices. In the Pueblo County case, the tamper-evident seal on the voting machine appeared to be disturbed. The case remains under investigation."
