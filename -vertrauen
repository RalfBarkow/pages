        "text": "There are books by [[Niklas Luhmann]] that address sociologically obvious topics, and there are other publications with which he responds to current interests of a broader public. The book on trust, which first appeared in 1968, does not belong in either category. If the text had not been published at that time, probably no one would have missed it: neither in sociology, which will discover the trust topic only later, nor in the world of mass media, where other issues were found to be of priority at that time. One may therefore assume that the choice of topic was primarily motivated by theory."
