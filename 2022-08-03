I expressed my fear that such games would brutalize him. He answered me: Do I really believe that he and his friends can't distinguish between games and real violence? I had to agree with him. [[Donald Winnicott]], the English pediatrician and psychoanalyst, spoke of a transitional world in so-called normal people, which they would never confuse with reality. Like him, I do not believe in the danger of such a confusion. Whereby I have to differentiate in one point: There seems to be an increasing [[gamification]] of society. Gaming as a model is taking hold of ever larger parts of our society."

Virtual Commissioning was recently used to perform realistic virtual simulations in the early stages of development processes in automation of the conveyors too. The main benefit is the possibility of integrating and testing the control system through the simulation on the virtual model even before physically constructing the conveyor. The contribution focuses on the possibilities of transforming a real conveyor into a virtual model in the Siemens Tecnomatix Process Simulate program and integrating the Siemens S7-300 real control system to control the conveyor itself. In the model it was allowed to test and perform numerous variations and situations without physical intervention into the real conveyor and possible damage functional parts including through virtual reality. These experiments were subsequently evaluated and the control system optimized with respect to material flow and the developed PLC code on virtual model was verified on real conveyor control system."

These symbols are laid out in networks in a manner similar to a \"rung\" of a relay ladder logic diagram. This library provides Tik Z symbols to draw high-quality ladder diagrams. All standard and some non-standard symbols are possible, including all kinds of contacts, coils and blocks. I decided to write this package, although it is available another package named ladder that also uses Tik Z to typeset ladder diagrams because that package seems to lack support for blocks. The [[tikz-ladder]], on the contrary, supports all features described in IEC-61 131-3, namely, blocks (for functions, function blocks, etc.), contacts and coils."

We have trouble bearing contradictory feelings, and split off part of them in order to then fight them in the other. With the result that society splits into the two sides of an ambivalence. We have seen this in the bitter dispute over vaccination.

Virtual Commissioning was recently used to perform realistic virtual simulations in the early stages of development processes in automation of the conveyors too. The main benefit is the possibility of integrating and testing the control system through the simulation on the virtual model even before physically constructing the conveyor. The contribution focuses on the possibilities of transforming a real conveyor into a virtual model in the Siemens Tecnomatix Process Simulate program and integrating the Siemens S7-300 real control system to control the conveyor itself. In the model it was allowed to test and perform numerous variations and situations without physical intervention into the real conveyor and possible damage functional parts including through virtual reality. These experiments were subsequently evaluated and the control system optimized with respect to material flow and the developed PLC code on virtual model was verified on real conveyor control system."

        "text": "> Designing of the conveyors and its control system with control program through the design tool “[[Virtual Commissioning]]” is very important in the digital era Industry 4.0. Virtual Commissioning was recently used to perform realistic virtual simulations in the early stages of development processes in automation of the conveyors too. The main benefit is the possibility of integrating and testing the control system through the simulation on the virtual model even before physically constructing the conveyor. The contribution focuses on the possibilities of transforming a real conveyor into a virtual model in the Siemens Tecnomatix Process Simulate program and integrating the Siemens S7-300 real control system to control the conveyor itself. In the model it was allowed to test and perform numerous variations and situations without physical intervention into the real conveyor and possible damage functional parts including through virtual reality. These experiments were subsequently evaluated and the control system optimized with respect to material flow and the developed PLC code on virtual model was verified on real conveyor control system."

Which means nothing other than that they could take over power at some point. This fear is understandable. After all, the machines are superior to us in so many ways and are becoming more and more so."

Does technology have something of a sacrilege?\n\nYes, because technology imitates life in a certain way. To build machines is to create life. That also applies to artificial intelligence. And that is our sacrilege, because the creation of life is reserved for God. One notices this in every article about the intervention into the genetic material. It is always implied that we are playing God. But that is what we are supposed to do. Because we need the technology to survive."

We are dealing with a deep ambivalence. And people tend to externalize their ambivalences. We have trouble bearing contradictory feelings, and split off part of them in order to then fight them in the other. With the result that society splits into the two sides of an ambivalence. We have seen this in the bitter dispute over vaccination. It is similar with technology: the euphorics overlook the dangers of technology, the pessimists recognize neither its benefits nor its beauty. However, there is no debate between the two; it remains a mutual heating up without development."

We are not keeping up at all."

An LD program enables the programmable controller to test and modify data using standard graphic symbols. These symbols are laid out in networks in a manner similar to a \"rung\" of a relay ladder logic diagram. This library provides Tik Z symbols to draw high-quality ladder diagrams. All standard and some non-standard symbols are possible, including all kinds of contacts, coils and blocks. I decided to write this package, although it is available another package named ladder that also uses Tik Z to typeset ladder diagrams because that package seems to lack support for blocks. The [[tikz-ladder]], on the contrary, supports all features described in IEC-61 131-3, namely, blocks (for functions, function blocks, etc.), contacts and coils."
