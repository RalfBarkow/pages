If there is a shared understanding that we are here to <i>write</i> and <i>edit</i> text to be clearer, more attractive, and more persuasive, and thereby explore a wide variety of ideas, then text and on-topic ideas will emerge which are more wonderful than any individual could have come up with alone, and we'll all have a good time. If the shared social norm is that we are here to prevent the expression of bad ideas, and cast shame on people who post them or believe them, then people will be trying to make others back down instead of finding ways to cooperate. That understanding of the purpose of wiki is what leads people to post insults aimed at humiliating people they disagree with, delete or drown out ideas they disagree with, create [[Thread Mess]]''es where nearly all the words are accusations that another participant didn't meet some burden of proof or assessments of the other participants' intelligence.

That all should behave nicely like motherhood and apple pie, is all nice and good but doesn't actually solve anything. If imposture and merely incompetence is treated just like legitimate discourse, then what you end up with is one big pile of junk, that may have entertaining value for its contributors, but no value to [[Wiki Reader]]s. So like it or not, wikis need a mechanism to <b>select</b> (or better said <i>distinguish</i>' ) the \"good stuff\" from the \"bad stuff\", if they are to have any finality. And it's not gonna come because impostors will suddenly feel the urge to stop posing or that people trolling from the position of ignoramus will suddenly feel the urge to read more and write less, or that people with over-inflated egos will discover the value of humility. You can try to be the apostle for that change, and I wish you good luck with it, but I just do not see it happening, and there's hardly anything in the history of human culture in general to give you hope in that direction.

If there is a shared understanding that we are here to <i>write</i> and <i>edit</i> text to be clearer, more attractive, and more persuasive, and thereby explore a wide variety of ideas, then text and on-topic ideas will emerge which are more wonderful than any individual could have come up with alone, and we'll all have a good time. If the shared social norm is that we are here to prevent the expression of bad ideas, and cast shame on people who post them or believe them, then people will be trying to make others back down instead of finding ways to cooperate. That understanding of the purpose of wiki is what leads people to post insults aimed at humiliating people they disagree with, delete or drown out ideas they disagree with, create [[Thread Mess]]''es where nearly all the words are accusations that another participant didn't meet some burden of proof or assessments of the other participants' intelligence.

If imposture and merely incompetence is treated just like legitimate discourse, then what you end up with is one big pile of junk, that may have entertaining value for its contributors, but no value to [[Wiki Reader]]s.

You can try to be the apostle for that change, and I wish you good luck with it, but I just do not see it happening, and there's hardly anything in the history of human culture in general to give you hope in that direction.

From your actions, it's pretty clear you're not neutral about it but refer rather either to majority ideas or your own ideas. And that's pretty damned frustrating.
