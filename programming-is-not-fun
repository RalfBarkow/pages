They want somebody who has already been doing the exact target job for at least 5 years. HR's decision process is not the fault of programming.

You pretty much have to eat, breathe, and live coding or it will eat you up and spit you out. I can't really articulate what makes this field so different other than that technology is constantly changing, you generally need to store entire modules if not entire programs in your head while you're working on something, and that the myth of the [[Antisocial Programmer]] has some truth to it.
