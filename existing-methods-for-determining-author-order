      "text": "The problem with existing approaches to author order is their reliance on metrics and systems that aim to accurately reward contributions to a paper. The Vancouver Protocol (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, 1978) standardizes biomedical journal submissions and includes standards for what one must contribute to be considered an author: conception and design, or analysis and interpretation of data; drafting the article or revising for intellectual content; and/or final approval of the version to be published. However, it does not offer a standard for how to choose author order other than it “should be a joint decision of the coauthors” (1978: 4). In contrast, psychologist Stephen Kosslyn’s system measures contribution up to a maximum of 1,000 points, where anyone with less than 100 points is acknowledged in a footnote (Kosslyn, 2002). This system aims to quantify unlike tasks–ideas versus bench work, writing versus note-taking (also see Venkatraman, 2016)."

Others participate in games of chance, such as: rock, paper, scissors (Kupfer et al., 2004) and coin-toss (Miller & Ballard, 1992). In situations where a paper requires additional authors, cats have been credited as co-authors (McGaw & Twitchit, 2012, Hetherington & Willard, 1975).

Some co-authors publish under their research group name rather than individual names (e.g. Superstorm Research Lab, 2013). Food geographer Ian Cook uses ‘Cook et al.’ to acknowledge the collective work in any research-writing endeavor (e.g. Cook et al., 2008). Yet these practices do not accrue value to members that help them to acquire sought-after positions; we have collectively decided to privilege individuals’ names, even as we problematize hyper-individualism in science in other ways."
