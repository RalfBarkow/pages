And also a quick revisit of her SoFI spheres.\n- We agreed to delay Gather trial as a part of a future meeting\n- Jen shared that the main issues she'd had with Map the System was the lack of support on tools and also how to scope a systems project\n- Marc shared his view that civil society, business and government are out of balance. To redress this he has been providing and vernacularising the tools he had access to in business. We can't simply inflict these tools on neighborhoods.\n- Bob talked about his projects eg [https://undoneolib.wordpress.com/ neoliberalism]. He will learn about the fedwiki with Marc.\n- John reported that he has been invited to speak to a conference on VR. He raised the issue that we need to create an organisational form to enable us to access grant funding. Richard offered to run a session on this with the process enneagram.\n- Bob suggested that we need a growth strategy eg 1 school, 1 Trust, 1 Region etc.\n- The FAQ's page needs checking and populating. How to do this?\n- John talked about recording the Woolman meeting if they are amenable.\n"

The aim is that we test the tools before recommending them in the StS toolkit. Ward is exploring building the capacities in the fedwiki.\n- Kerry briefly showed the pages on SOFI spheres and how we plan to use them.\n- We will try meeting in Gather next time.\n- Nic gave us an excellent introduction to VR and its potential in StS. Reactions ranged from excitement to interest to suspicion. We will explore and experiment to discover the value for StS.\n- Kerry shared the National Lottery [[Expression of Interest]] page. Contributions welcomed...\n- Discussion of the core group StS trial is on hold til next week when hopefully all will be present.\n- [[Empowering Change Agents]] is a course I have proposed to the ORS. It is our opportunity to design the mentor toolkit and training. This also ties in the [[Woolman Proposals]]. One of which is a week long mentor/guide training for StS.\n- Kerry has created 2 new pages: [[Questions]] is a page for us to propose questions for the group. [[Frequently Asked Questions]] is a page with the questions that others may ask (participants, mentors, partners, public)\n"

Kerry and John have created a set of [[Woolman Proposals]] for multigenerational experiments on the Woolman campus. John believes this could be our future site in California. This could be a route to scale StS through the Quaker global network.\n- Marc talked about communication platforms. He stressed that all our tools and platforms need to be usable by kids in local communities. We have a Discord channel and a Gather.town space here: https://gather.town/app/KXrhdl0kkQCJwutX/SeetheSystemsNode0. We will experiment with Gather at next week's meeting. John thinks the future is VR and Kerry agreed to get Nic Mcnally to present to the group on this opportunity next week.\n- Kerry shared the 4 loop simplified StS CLD she shared at the ISSS conference. Marc and Kerry will work out how to share this in the Fedwiki.\n- Marc and Kerry have been exploring the potential for Vester's Sensimod in StS. More to follow....\n- Marc has prepared a set of pages to help us manage StS using the SOFI spheres and links. Kerry to contact sphere leads to engage. See [[StS Updates Index]]. It is essential that we have a single person as sphere lead (whilst others can be in supporting roles)\n- Claudius talked about smart cities as an opportunity and what has been happening with community self organization in SA. Africa is an unexplored opportunity for StS. Victor's school in Nigeria is an opportunity.\n- Marc shared the Relocalize Creativity Temple(ate). He proposes replacing the current model pillars with Aristotle/Ackoff's Beauty/Good/Truth/Economy.\n"

Kerry would like to bring in Denise Brouder (known by Kerry, Jen and Claudius). I have since asked and she would be honoured to join us. Marc commented that we currently have the magic number 5 (3-7) attending our meetings.\n- Kerry shared her latest SOFI assessment of StS (done in the SOFI software.)\n- Discussion on Partners eg the ethics of signing NDA's. Also how we charge for our work. We discussed whether people value what they don't pay for. We agreed we need to cover out of pocket expenses and that we need to consider some pay forward mechanism eg a commitment to pass on what they learn from us to a certain number of people. We will need to flexible in considering these arrangements. Need a working party to propose some ways of working in this area.\n- What sort of cash flow will be needed to support StS? Jen said she would be happy to help with the modelling work.\n- We talked about forthcoming trials. There will be one in the UK with the ORS probably in October (half term.) I have submitted an abstract for a StS workshop at the OR63 conference in September. I have also prepared an article for Inside OR (August edition) to drum up interest.\n- We are aiming for further trials this year in New York (Richard interested and I am sure Denise Brouder will be), India and Australia. Maybe also in Europe with ChessPlus.\n- Kerry shared the draft workplan. We now need to staff the activities. Kerry will propose some teams at the next meeting based on the preferences expressed in the original preference spreadsheet.\n- Wordpress would be a good platform for our website(s)."

      "text": "# 20 June 2021 4pm UK\n- Present: Marc, John, Richard, Mick, Claudius, Sarah (apologies: Bruce, Jen)\n- We discussed the issue of ethical behavior in the group. It is crucial that this group finds resonance and trust in each other and is completely focused on the aims of See the Systems. John described the group as a tender shoot that requires nurturing. \n- We agreed that people not on the same path and distracting us from our mission will be asked to leave the group. This does not preclude group members from operating with these people...but this is not the purpose of See the Systems. I note that we also need to think about a protocol for bringing in new group members. Sarah attended for the first time today: I have known and worked with Sarah for over two decades. Trust matters.\n- It is understood that all developments on the fedwiki are protected by a creative commons license. My intention is that the content of \"See the Systems\" is freely available to all children. This does not preclude any of us offering our services to other organisations at usual consulting rates. Marc made a statement in the chat about his consulting rates. I did not say this in the meeting but I wish to have it go on record that I have only rarely worked for consulting rates since leaving IBM back in 2005. Rather I have given away my time and skills to start-ups whose values I support in return for shelter and food (or at least covering my additional out of pocket expenses for the project.) \n- We discussed the issue of payment for See the Systems and Marc proposed a scheme of \"paying forward\". This means that the people we train and work with agree to pass on their learning (similarly for free) to a certain number of others (with the proviso that they too will do the same.) We need to explore how we can experiment with this.\n- Kerry Talked about her experiences with a Mini See the Systems experiment in Oregon. The group commented that this is innovation and the ultimate key is adoption. We discussed the potential of Mick's idea to create a network of after school clubs to support children on their journey into seeing systems. We have taken ChangeOurWorld.Club as a suitable domain name. We will explore for scope for this after the 2nd cohort in Oregon has completed.\n- Kerry talked about the breadth of issues discussed by the first Oregon cohort. Bullying in various forms from the playground to the lack of inclusive societies to global prejudices. We agreed that bullying/inclusivity is a great topic to explore. It is being explored also at the ISSS (Kerry is facilitating an experiment to jointly create a CLD.)\n- John reported back on our meeting with Woolman. We are scoping a multigenerational StS project with them. The quaker approach to meetings (silence, consensus) is very refreshing and calming.\n- Marc led a session to explore our individual assessments of the states of the SOFI spheres for StS. Spheres felt to be red were: 11,1,3,6,3,5, 6,4. It is interesting how needing to make assessments helps us t get clearer about meaning. \n- Kerry will share the draft workplan she has prepared.\n- We agreed to change our meeting to Friday. \n- Marc commented on the fedwiki training which took place on Saturday. Marc is happy to teach those who were unable to attend in another session. He will circulate fedwiki pages to us to fork and practice.\n"

The program uses a protocol called a DIG (Designed Ingenuity.) There are two sessions of two weeks each with 80 children in each. Week 1 is a scrambler DIG (to create teams of 7/8 kids in a highly connected system.) Week 2 is a challenge DIG (to focus the team on mapping a local issue they care about, identifying things they can do about it and identifying ways of evaluating the impact.

Kerry and John have created a set of [[Woolman Proposals]] for multigenerational experiments on the Woolman campus. John believes this could be our future site in California. This could be a route to scale StS through the Quaker global network.\n- Marc talked about communication platforms. He stressed that all our tools and platforms need to be usable by kids in local communities. We have a Discord channel and a Gather.town space here: https://gather.town/app/KXrhdl0kkQCJwutX/SeetheSystemsNode0. We will experiment with Gather at next week's meeting. John thinks the future is VR and Kerry agreed to get Nic Mcnally to present to the group on this opportunity next week.\n- Kerry shared the 4 loop simplified StS CLD she shared at the ISSS conference. Marc and Kerry will work out how to share this in the Fedwiki.\n- Marc and Kerry have been exploring the potential for Vester's Sensimod in StS. More to follow....\n- Marc has prepared a set of pages to help us manage StS using the SOFI spheres and links. Kerry to contact sphere leads to engage. See [[StS Updates Index]]. It is essential that we have a single person as sphere lead (whilst others can be in supporting roles)\n- Claudius talked about smart cities as an opportunity and what has been happening with community self organization in SA. Africa is an unexplored opportunity for StS. Victor's school in Nigeria is an opportunity.\n- Marc shared the Relocalize Creativity Temple(ate). He proposes replacing the current model pillars with Aristotle/Ackoff's Beauty/Good/Truth/Economy.\n"

The aim is that we test the tools before recommending them in the StS toolkit. Ward is exploring building the capacities in the fedwiki.\n- Kerry briefly showed the pages on SOFI spheres and how we plan to use them.\n- Nic gave us an excellent introduction to VR and its potential in StS. Reactions ranged from excitement to interest to suspicion. We will explore and experiment to discover the value for StS.\n- Kerry shared the National Lottery [[Expression of Interest]] page. Contributions welcomed...\n- Discussion of the core group StS trial is on hold til next week when hopefully all will be present.\n- [[Empowering Change Agents]] is a course I have proposed to the ORS. It is our opportunity to design the mentor toolkit and training. This also ties in the [[Woolman Proposals]]. One of which is a week long mentor/guide training for StS.\n- Kerry has created 2 new pages: [[Questions]] is a page for us to propose questions for the group. [[Frequently Asked Questions]] is a page with the questions that others may ask (participants, mentors, partners, public)\n"
