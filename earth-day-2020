This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n- [[Advocacy]]: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n- [[Volunteering]]: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, “The Great Global Cleanup” and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100 million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others — including K-12 students around the world — to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks. EDN is also working with partners to plant 7.8 billion trees, one for every human who will live on the planet in 2020. Combined, these volunteer activities will be the largest volunteer event in history. [28][29][30]\n- [[Education]]: Earth Day is building environmental and climate literacy worldwide. EDN will continue to work with teachers, students, innovators and thought leaders to educate and activate a new generation of environmental leaders around the world.\n- [[Events]]: Earth Day is now recognized worldwide as the planet's most significant civic engagement event each year. The 50th anniversary of Earth Day will be marked by tens of thousands of rallies and community events in every country in the world, and large-scale signature events to take place in Washington, D.C., and other global capitals.\n- [[Artists for the Earth]]: As Earth Day reaches its milestone 50th Anniversary in April 2020, nature and the environment are faced with enormous challenges from loss of biodiversity, pollution, degradation of our ecosystems, and climate change. Art must join with science to personalize climate change and disseminate it to a wider audience."
