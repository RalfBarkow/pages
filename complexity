The concept of complexity thus formulates first of all the intention to see manifoldness from the point of view of its unity. The complex object must be manifold and unity at the same time.**\n"

Depending on the modal-theoretical frame of reference, this reference to unity appears partly as a concomitant necessity in the contingently composed,18 partly as a question of securing the categorial correspondence of being and cognition when accessing the totality of content.19 (Today's ideas would rather correspond to a majority of \"levels of language.)20 It always seems to have been an undiscussed prerequisite of the problem that it was about the unity of the complex itself. Exactly in this the perfection specific to the object was seen, that it brought multiplicity and distinctness (multitudo et distinctio) to an ordered unity - by the will of the creator or by the function of the imagination of the transcendental subject. And at the same time the unity of the complex subject was a guarantee for the decidability of the question whether statements contradict each other, i.e. precondition of the principle of non-contradiction. Finally, it offered to the older doctrine the starting point for cosmological explanations, about whose bases science cannot fully dispose."

Depending on the modal-theoretical frame of reference, this reference to unity appears partly as a concomitant necessity in the contingently composed,18 partly as a question of securing the categorial correspondence of being and cognition when accessing the totality of content.19 (Today's ideas would rather correspond to a majority of \"levels of language.)20 It always seems to have been an undiscussed prerequisite of the problem that it was about the unity of the complex itself. Exactly in this the perfection specific to the object was seen, that it brought multiplicity and distinctness (multitudo et distinctio) to an ordered unity - by the will of the creator or by the function of the imagination of the transcendental subject. And at the same time the unity of the complex subject was a guarantee for the decidability of the question whether statements contradict each other, i.e. precondition of the principle of non-contradiction. Finally, it offered to the older doctrine the starting point for cosmological explanations, about whose bases science cannot fully dispose."
