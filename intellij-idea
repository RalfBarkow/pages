However, version 4 is much slower.  Also, I have trouble finding features in 4 that were easy to find in 3.  It's almost like they are moving towards Eclipse which is the opposite of where they should be going.  Slow and complex is not where I want to go.  I like the fast and simple \"read-your-mind\" flow of version 3.  I hope they introduce a \"classic\" mode that basically completely emulates version 3 in every detail including the speed (which is critical to the rapid feedback of [[Test Driven Development]]). --[[Mike Corum]]",
