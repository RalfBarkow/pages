Look at what happened to the Communications of the ACM when they tried; they went from ground-breaking articles that blended theory and practice to gee-whiz-isn't-this-cool articles. They thought any mention of theory would kill them, so they committed suicide.

Look at what happened to the Communications of the ACM when they tried; they went from ground-breaking articles that blended theory and practice to gee-whiz-isn't-this-cool articles. They thought any mention of theory would kill them, so they committed suicide.

To me, the [[Cpp Report]] is one of the best pragmatic magazines out there.
