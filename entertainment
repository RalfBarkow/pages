Where the law of the strongest makes the application of factually justifiable, legal principles of decision-making superfluous, conditions prevail that were historically overcome in the process of civilization. In this context, the question of whether a war takes place with or without the legal legitimacy provided by a UN mandate takes on its significance. Thus, it could well be that we are currently witnessing not a \"Clash Of Civilizations\" but a war against civilization. This raises the question of who it is that is attacking and threatening it.\n"
