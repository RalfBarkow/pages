The dictatorship of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey is characterized by a similar development: An economic and political awakening in the early noughties was followed in 2013 by a democratic awakening with the protests over Istanbul's Gezi Park, which was violently put down. Subsequently, the opposition was persecuted even more intensively than before, Turkey participated as a warring party in Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh, and is currently in the midst of a historic economic crisis. Significantly, the name of the Turkish president does not appear in the contributions to the debate so far. Nor do the names of Orbán, Kaczynski, Trump or Johnson."

Western democracy, as it emerged after the Second World War, was based to an important extent on a class compromise that varied from region to region and successfully integrated the working class into the bourgeois state. The basis for this, apart from the threat from the Eastern bloc, was the high level of the productive forces. Their further development, and with it the dissolution of a large industrial working class, has since undermined this class compromise, as can be seen, among other things, in the disintegration of the classical left-wing and conservative parties in Western Europe. As a result, as can be seen impressively in the example of Donald Trump, the democratic order of the West is disintegrating and an authoritarian style of politics is gaining influence."

An analysis that does not relate the authoritarian developments in Eastern Europe to the development of global capitalist relations fails to recognize the danger that arises from this situation. The construction of an antagonism between the democratic West and the Eastern despots based on this situation runs the risk of degenerating into an ideology of legitimation for coming conflicts. These will no longer be fought out solely in economic or political terms, as the example of Ukraine currently shows impressively."

It is not a fraternal friend of the Russian regime, but merely a partner in an alliance of convenience and at the same time a fierce competitor. For with the Belt and Road Initiative, the billion-dollar intercontinental infrastructure project of a \"New Silk Road,\" China is about to take control in Russia's southeastern foreland."

The dictatorship of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey is characterized by a similar development: An economic and political awakening in the early noughties was followed in 2013 by a democratic awakening with the protests over Istanbul's Gezi Park, which was violently put down. Subsequently, the opposition was persecuted even more intensively than before, Turkey participated as a warring party in Syria and Nagorno-Karabakh, and is currently in the midst of a historic economic crisis. Significantly, the name of the Turkish president does not appear in the contributions to the debate so far. Nor do the names of Orbán, Kaczynski, Trump or Johnson."

Western democracy, as it emerged after the Second World War, was based to an important extent on a class compromise that varied from region to region and successfully integrated the working class into the bourgeois state. The basis for this, apart from the threat from the Eastern bloc, was the high level of the productive forces. Their further development, and with it the dissolution of a large industrial working class, has since undermined this class compromise, as can be seen, among other things, in the disintegration of the classical left-wing and conservative parties in Western Europe. As a result, as can be seen impressively in the example of Donald Trump, the democratic order of the West is disintegrating and an authoritarian style of politics is gaining influence."

An analysis that does not relate the authoritarian developments in Eastern Europe to the development of global capitalist relations fails to recognize the danger that arises from this situation. The construction of an antagonism between the democratic West and the Eastern despots based on this situation runs the risk of degenerating into an ideology of legitimation for coming conflicts. These will no longer be fought out solely in economic or political terms, as the example of Ukraine currently shows impressively."
