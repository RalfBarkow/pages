An ion-trap version of entanglement transfer could easily be accomplished by adding a third ion to the trap. Here, the goal of the control process is to put the system spin in an entangled state […]. As noted above, such states can readily be produced by making the system spin interact directly with the ancilla spin. Suppose, however, that we are not allowed to make the two spins interact directly. It is a well-known fact that if two quantum systems are not entangled initially, they cannot become entangled through the exchange of classical information alone @40#. That is, no classical feedback loop that exchanges information between the system and ancilla can entangle them."

        "text": "The previous examples of quantum feedback loops were designed to show simply how quantum feedback differs from classical feedback, and how the ability of a controller to exchange quantum information with the controlled system allows it to perform feedback control of quantum systems in a way that is neither stochastic nor destructive. Quantum feedback loops can accomplish other tasks that are not possible classically. Before going on to the theoretical description of quantum feedback, let us look briefly at one such task, entanglement transfer."
