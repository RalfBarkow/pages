The principles in the doctrine table are connected, and have been mapped themselves in order to create the phases seen in the table. Hence any new principles are likely to be higher order phases which depend upon these underlying principles being in place. If this is the case (which seems likely) then it would explain the contraindication: if these basic principles don’t exist, then you are unlikely to be able to succeed in following those next generation behaviours."

You should then focus on the lowest order principles that the company is poor at. In the example shown here that would mean knowing your users, focus on user needs, removing bias and duplication, understand what is being considered, a bias towards using data and understanding the details. This should be done before any large scale technological, structural or methodology transformation or any attempt to emulate the next generation. Alternative examples of guiding principles include Amazon’s Leadership Principles, Microsoft and Haier."

In the example shown here that would mean knowing your users, focus on user needs, removing bias and duplication, understand what is being considered, a bias towards using data and understanding the details. This should be done before any large scale technological, structural or methodology transformation or any attempt to emulate the next generation.
