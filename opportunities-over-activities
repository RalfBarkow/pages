Exploring Ritchhart’s eight cultural forces can highlight the small yet powerful shifts in pedagogy that position learners as active thinkers, questioners, and investigators. As educators shift their roles, the learners' roles shifts also; seemingly tiny changes create influential ripples for engagement and learning. "

With a greater focus on the [[Split Screen Approach]] and [[Powerful Provocations]], learners are positioned to do more of the cognitive heavy lifting. They’re encouraged to do and think rather than copy and complete. "
