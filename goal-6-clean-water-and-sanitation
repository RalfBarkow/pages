Therefore, toilets in schools and work places are specifically mentioned as a target to measure. \"Equitable sanitation\" calls for addressing the specific needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities. Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented."
