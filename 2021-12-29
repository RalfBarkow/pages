However, it now feels like the world has finally caught up - and we’re in grave danger of being overtaken by a dystopia where the big tech companies balkanize the Metaverse into a series of closed proprietary user-exploitin"

It could open up everything from decentralised encrypted collaborative document editing to collaborative whiteboarding and collaborative Figma-style (or Penpot- or Blender-style) design. You could even start storing an HTML DOM into a room, alongside its binary assets, giving you a multiplayer DOM to build on… and then imagine if you could store the syntax tree of the code operating on that DOM alongside it, in the same room. Before you know it, we will have created kind of some incredible Smalltalk / Croquet / Alan Kay nirvana where code is data and data is code and it’s all running live in some kind of decentralised encrypted multiplayer Metaverse :D"

You could even start storing an HTML DOM into a room, alongside its binary assets, giving you a multiplayer DOM to build on… and then imagine if you could store the syntax tree of the code operating on that DOM alongside it, in the same room.
