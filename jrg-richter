      "text": "After abandoning his LEGO bricks he discovered the computer as the ultimate tool for endless puzzles. That was 1981 when he learned Z80 assembler on a MPF-I. A year later he did Pac Man and Centipede clones on his ZX Spectrum. When at high school he created MIDI sound editors for Roland keyboards and sold them through G.C.Geerdes and Softarts. After studying computer science and linguistics he built the artfacts.net website, one of the largest about contemporary arts. Today he is passionate about designing the digital medium to its greatest potential, which according to Janet Murray is building shared structures of meaning. Since 2019 he runs Essential Madness Radio (EMR) [http://emr.fm/ site], an ever changing stream of weird music."
