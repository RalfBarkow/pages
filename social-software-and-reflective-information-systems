      "text": "The promotion of integration knowledge can start from different starting points. Existing knowledge must be networked and used in new tasks (Zahn et al. 2005; Meyer et al. 2005). In principle, integration knowledge can be learned through indirect learning processes, e.g., during job changes through job rotation or during knowledge exchange in expert circles ([[Communities of Practice]]). Companies must enable their employees to know and apply internal sources of knowledge (e.g., experts, databases or archives). By localizing such sources, for example with the help of knowledge maps, knowledge required for innovation processes can be located quickly and applied in a structured manner. However, this does not necessarily require the storage of concrete content in a \"knowledge database\". Rather, it is helpful to have references to the places where certain topics can be explored in greater depth. In this way, the basis for the emergence of integration knowledge is created through networking and the possibility of transferring core knowledge."
