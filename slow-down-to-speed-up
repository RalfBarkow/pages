The velocity of the thrown ball at the moment it leaves the hand is the velocity of the hand. The whipping action causes surprising velocities. The same action is used to \"spike\" a volleyball. The article says that rushing caused drag. Who knows what that means, exactly, but it translates into a less effective \"whip\".  Keeping the arm too tense could do that, and perhaps rushing the delivery results in too tense an arm, while slowing down the pre-delivery motion yields a more rubbery arm, as needed for high velocity throwing. The paradox vanishes when we realize that the motions are complex and staged out in time so that a slowness in one part does not imply slowness overall.
