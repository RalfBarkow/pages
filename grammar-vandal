No, I stand my ground as I always have, having worked extensively with the mentally ill, this person is very much mentally-ill and needs help. Also, it's not name calling, it's the truth. There is no way to defend changing peoples meanings, assuming other's identity for reasons of malice, and moronically fighting against an automatic script. I have worked with people who demonstrate similar behavior, and it is easily controlled with medication and psychiatric care. It's not funny, or something that should be tolerated, but something that needs to be helped before the person becomes even more ill.
