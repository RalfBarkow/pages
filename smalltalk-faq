If a test fails, run it in debug mode, you'll get a debugger, and you can see immediately why it fails. It's the simplest thing that could possibly work. \nAnd having done it both ways, I find this much less time-consuming than trying to write tests that generate informative error messages. -- [[Alan Knight]]",
