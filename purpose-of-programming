It was amazing -- even with a text-only screen and a 2 MHz 8-bit processor -- you could render any concept.  Never mind that the machines of that generation lacked the resources for the kind of stuff we do today.  What was clear was that, given the resources, <i>anything</i> could be modeled.  I remember trying to convey this to the people around me that saw it as a large, heavy, expensive calculator.  I remember the frustration of trying to show them that, while a computer does calculate, calculation is not its primary value.  It's a communications device of unparalleled flexibility.",

Extending our thought about programming, humanity has been very successful in increasing revenue gainings with better programming tools and techniques. But we are facing new challenges, such as climate changes, in a planet with limited resources. It is my felling that software, as well as technology will help us to learn to associate success with natural resource usage optimization, and not only revenue increase or economic growth. I mean, programming can be whatever we intend to be, depend on who is creating the product and for what reason.",
