[Accessed 26 February 2023]. DOI 10.1080/02604027.2019.1654784. Outcomes depending on various interacting and adaptive parts and actors in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world are challenging to analyze using traditional thinking. Hence, Systems Thinking (ST) can be applied as a tool to aid policy makers in designing interventions that anticipates various ways in which a system might react to policy changes through the practice of integrating multiple perspectives into a causal loop diagram (CLD). We formalize criteria for identifying potential leverage points (PLP) in a CLD. Identifying PLPs enable policy makers to apply ST tools to devise strategies that are capable of addressing VUCA problems.\n"

The value of communication is deemed critical in this aspect. Furthering this, Laszlo (2012) espoused that to achieve the optimum level of engagement among social systems, collaboration, vision, and values alignment, as well as problem-solving where both leaders and members adapt a cohesive organizational culture is necessary to allow better management of complex changes and challenges (Laszlo, 2012). This suggests the need for the vital role played by organization leaders in fostering active participation and systems thinking (Shaked & Schechter, 2013; Laszlo, 2012)."

For example, a system may become too complex to manage until a certain point where a decision is made to simplify the system or to adopt a new strategy for managing the complexity.

The value of communication is deemed critical in this aspect. Furthering this, Laszlo (2012) espoused that to achieve the optimum level of engagement among social systems, collaboration, vision, and values alignment, as well as problem-solving where both leaders and members adapt a cohesive organizational culture is necessary to allow better management of complex changes and challenges (Laszlo, 2012). This suggests the need for the vital role played by organization leaders in fostering active participation and systems thinking (Shaked & Schechter, 2013; Laszlo, 2012)."

In ST, there exists a concept of leverage points. According to Senge (1990), it is a place in the structure of the system where a solution (i.e., actions and changes in structure) can be applied that “can lead to significant, enduring improvements” (p. 114). It is important to note that best results do not necessarily come from large-scale interventions but can also be from small and well-focused actions. Specifically, it is a low leverage point if a small amount of change causes a small change in system behavior and it is a high leverage point if a small amount of change causes a large change in system behavior. Finding leverage points, particularly a high leverage point, is a challenge that requires the use of advanced problem-solving tools. Likewise, it becomes more puzzling if there are multiple leverage points in a system. Hence, we offer an alternative criteria allowing for the location of a point in a CLD where interventions made can maximize leverage. We call this the Potential Leverage Point (PLP). As such, we pose the research question: How to identify potential leverage points in a system within a causal loop diagram? By identifying PLPs, we can apply intervention that can maximize leverage.
