You can ignore all the non-functional clutter about concurrency, distribution, persistence, performance, scalability, and so on. Those are tackled in the design model. I'm applying the analysis model idea to reverse-engineer a very large mobile telecomms network, hoping that such an object model will help us localise changes and identify commonality & abstractions.
