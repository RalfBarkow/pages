It is important to note that the evolution of the topic structure (tree) is a very dynamic process whereby much time and energy may be spent on one level of the tree, with members generating many issues and comments before resolving the sub-topics to be later explored. We envision communities deliberating at a given level to explore most of the important issues under the topic before growing the tree through the addition of new sub-topics. However, it is also possible to grow one or more branchs of the tree, proceeding to a deeper level, if that is the \"path of least resistence\". There are no restrictions on the order in which levels get added to the tree. Additionally, we plan to provide mechanisms that will allow the restructuring of the tree if the community decides that a given branch should be promoted to a higher point in the tree, or demoted to become a child of some other node that is a descendent of the one to which it is currently an offspring. The process of discourse should be flexible but always produce a tree structure, whether balanced or not.\n",

Each day that the nominated topic does not receive some form of community support (described below) the t2l value is decremented. If it reaches zero, then the nominated item is removed from the set (perhaps after archiving for audit trail support). If, on the other hand, the community provides support for the item, then it's t2l value is incremented by a non-unit value and it continues to live in the structure. In fact, when the t2l value exceeds some agreed upon limit, the item can be made permanent. This means that the community has agreed that the item is a genuine and important sub-topic and that it is at the appropriate level in the tree.",

CMs may also support a topic by adding additional types of objects to the appropriate sets in the topic object.
