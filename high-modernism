It’s associated with the idea of both technological and political progress, that the future will be better than the past, and that human action can *make* it better. It also sees a trend toward increased individualism and the idea of self-improvement. As political institutions like the nation state take hold, the idea that people can improve themselves tends to shade into the idea that the state should improve them. For example, in the Russian Stolypin reforms of 1906-1914, quote, “The state officials and agrarian reformers reasoned that, once given a consolidated, private plot, the peasant would suddenly want to get rich and would organize his household into an efficient workforce and take up scientific agriculture.” That didn’t work, as the Czar and his ministers found out in WWI. Later, the USSR would double down on creating what they called the New Soviet Man, with even worse results."
