Writing your code at the highest semantic level appropriate for the application allows the compiler the greatest amount of leeway (usually) in optimizations, especially when it comes to cross-platform code that may run faster with multiplication or may run faster with bitshifts, and which may be optimized for speed or may be optimized for space. The general rule I follow when considering optimizing my code is that the people who write my compiler are Smarter Than I Am, and know my hardware Better Than I Do.\nWhile I’m here, I’ll note that while shifting may outperform multiplication on some systems, there comes a point (in terms of the number of high bits in your multiplicand, and thus necessary shifts and sums) on just about any system beyond which shifting and adding simply will not be faster.",
