If that element is reinforced with additional added contributions, as explained below, then the time to live value is increased and the item persists as part of the overall structure and is accessible to the community. If, however, the item is not reinforced by activity, it means that the community does not support it and its time to live value is decremented (daily). When it reaches zero, the element is archived and removed from the discourse structure. In this way, the structure emerges from the activity of the community and reflects what the community considers important."
