      "text": "> When programming with Smalltalk, the programmer usually starts from a snapshot which contains the core libraries, the development environment and the application under development. More precisely, the snapshot includes objects (such as the classes), the compiled methods in the form of bytecodes and the running processes. Developing applications consists essentially in writing and editing code, which installs, modifies and removes classes and compiled methods to and from the class hierarchy. Programming may be done live, as the application under development is running. For example, objects may have their shape changed on the fly as instance variables are added and removed. A new snapshot can be made during or at the end of the development session."

Then multiple analyses of the bug can be undertaken by loading the snapshot and resuming execution, either in the normal VM or in the simulator, short cutting the time to reach the bug."

More precisely, the snapshot includes objects (such as the classes), the compiled methods in the form of bytecodes and the running processes. Developing applications consists essentially in writing and editing code, which installs, modifies and removes classes and compiled methods to and from the class hierarchy. Programming may be done live, as the application under development is running. For example, objects may have their shape changed on the fly as instance variables are added and removed. A new snapshot can be made during or at the end of the development session."
