Intuitively, the meaning of object O to perceiver P is that how O affects P i.e. the meaning of an approaching lion (O) to a zebra (P) is that the zebra needs to make a run for it or cease to exist. That is helped by instinct not just a cerebral analysis of what \"Lion\" means to the zebra but the best interpretation in that situation is \"danger\". Likewise, the meaning of life to an individual is how life affects her/him and others. Of course, rain can have a meaning if the big game you were looking forward to washes out means disappointment conversely to the farmer that has not seen a drop in weeks it might mean keeping the family farm. Warm has meaning too - warm instrument spikes when Columbia was re-entering the atmosphere \"meant\" disaster not that there was anything they could have done. Even in that case the perished doing what was most meaningful to them. Meaning is in the eye of the interpreter and goals to give life meaning (to self as well as others) makes the question a practical instead of theoretical one. For the larger question of life's meaning we have to ask what is the meaning of the universe? Are there other universes? Why is there something instead of nothing? Is there [[Life On Other Planets]]? Are we asking the meaning of bacterial, plant and animal life or our own human world? Will we nuke ourselves completely and make the question moot, or will we find ways to get past our differences and expand our civilization throughout the cosmos (hopefully being able to cooperate with other civilizations should they exist)? Is there a personal God, a pantheon [?] or is [<i>God?</i>] just an illusion? In the end, instances of lives well lived help define the class [?] of what life should be and it's meaning.",

Our brains are made of things which we are starting to understand, chemicals etc. I can take a drug, for example which makes me, whatever position in life I'm in, happy. We think within ourselves, what would make us happy. i.e. if I want to do something, the reason is because it will make me happy, or I think it will. I believe we have an unlimited list of things possible, and we do the one which we THINK will make us happy. For example, a person who decides to say, work in a horrible job non stop in order to afford a car, is doing so because he believes that the car will make him, on average, happier than if he were to not to work and not get the car. After thinking about this idea for along time I have become to believe in fate. The idea of Fate is something I had been against for a long time, but my idea logically brings me to it. I do not choose what I think I would like or enjoy. It is something that has been affecting me since I was born. I have looked for role models, rejected them, found new ones etc. Every moment in my life I have been thinking, on some level, OK, now what should I do next that would make me happy.",

They may know that having sex behind their wife's back will give them a sort of happiness, happiness of the flesh, but internally their reason for not doing this is because they believe that the happiness gained from this act will be less than the feeling of unhappiness that they would suffer, guilt, possible marriage breakup etc. On the other hand there may be a person in this position who knows that they really want to do it, and knows they would feel no guilt, but doesn't do it because of other reasons like they think the unhappiness gained by a knockback from the proposed mistress it not worth the risk.

I do these out of love for my Savior, who set the example of self-less service. I have read good discussions that build a case for the idea that even the most altruistic action can be traced back to a selfish motive. This is a hard argument to refute. For example: I choose to avoid lusting over a woman's exposed body sitting next to me at the airport. I would <i>love</i> to just drool over that skin, personally, but my Savior asks me to avoid such behavior. Out of my love for Him, I comply. Is my compliance strictly unselfish? I hope to say yes. OTOH, I'm aware of my Father's loving, but firm discipline. Is part of my motivation powered by my selfish desire not to be punished? Hard to know for sure. Interesting subject, but me thinks we could run afoul of the Topic Police if we go on much further.

That is helped by instinct not just a cerebral analysis of what \"Lion\" means to the zebra but the best interpretation in that situation is \"danger\". Likewise, the meaning of life to an individual is how life affects her/him and others. Of course, rain can have a meaning if the big game you were looking forward to washes out means disappointment conversely to the farmer that has not seen a drop in weeks it might mean keeping the family farm. Warm has meaning too - warm instrument spikes when Columbia was re-entering the atmosphere \"meant\" disaster not that there was anything they could have done. Even in that case the perished doing what was most meaningful to them. Meaning is in the eye of the interpreter and goals to give life meaning (to self as well as others) makes the question a practical instead of theoretical one. For the larger question of life's meaning we have to ask what is the meaning of the universe? Are there other universes? Why is there something instead of nothing? Is there [[Life On Other Planets]]? Are we asking the meaning of bacterial, plant and animal life or our own human world? Will we nuke ourselves completely and make the question moot, or will we find ways to get past our differences and expand our civilization throughout the cosmos (hopefully being able to cooperate with other civilizations should they exist)?

We think within ourselves, what would make us happy. i.e. if I want to do something, the reason is because it will make me happy, or I think it will. I believe we have an unlimited list of things possible, and we do the one which we THINK will make us happy. For example, a person who decides to say, work in a horrible job non stop in order to afford a car, is doing so because he believes that the car will make him, on average, happier than if he were to not to work and not get the car. After thinking about this idea for along time I have become to believe in fate. The idea of Fate is something I had been against for a long time, but my idea logically brings me to it. I do not choose what I think I would like or enjoy. It is something that has been affecting me since I was born.

They may know that having sex behind their wife's back will give them a sort of happiness, happiness of the flesh, but internally their reason for not doing this is because they believe that the happiness gained from this act will be less than the feeling of unhappiness that they would suffer, guilt, possible marriage breakup etc. On the other hand there may be a person in this position who knows that they really want to do it, and knows they would feel no guilt, but doesn't do it because of other reasons like they think the unhappiness gained by a knockback from the proposed mistress it not worth the risk.

In most cases, one's purpose is self-improvement, but I'm not sure this would apply in respect of actions decided upon while, say, drugged, severely ill or extremely tired. Regardless of where the principles you apply come from, you still make decisions for the benefit of yourself. For example, you usually choose not to do something which will make you feel guilty or which you believe is likely to harm you. Of course, some decisions may still be mistakes (i.e., based on mistaken beliefs). It makes no more sense to find the meaning of life through religious belief than it does to find the meaning of computer software through your beliefs about what the software specification intended.</i>",

I agree I went on my search for meaning, because I cared about myself (making my motive, therefore, selfish). Having found God, though, and surrendered my life to Him, I have sometimes found myself having to choose life directions that I would prefer, personally, not to make. I do these out of love for my Savior, who set the example of self-less service. I have read good discussions that build a case for the idea that even the most altruistic action can be traced back to a selfish motive. This is a hard argument to refute. For example: I choose to avoid lusting over a woman's exposed body sitting next to me at the airport. I would <i>love</i> to just drool over that skin, personally, but my Savior asks me to avoid such behavior. Out of my love for Him, I comply. Is my compliance strictly unselfish? I hope to say yes. OTOH, I'm aware of my Father's loving, but firm discipline. Is part of my motivation powered by my selfish desire not to be punished? Hard to know for sure. Interesting subject, but me thinks we could run afoul of the Topic Police if we go on much further.
