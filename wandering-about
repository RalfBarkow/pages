I am the pivotal piece in the game of life—that one who makes it a particular live--my life. There is no heavy lifting to be done by the pivotal me—the mechanics of muscle and bone and world does the lifting. I am the decider, not the doer. Doing is all ready to go with free energy provided by the sun and harnessed by four and a half billion years of self-organizing earthiness. Everything is set for motion. \n"
