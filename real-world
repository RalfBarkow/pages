At some point in an overmanaged project, they told me it didn't matter how much money we spent; the client did not have any kind of budget for the project, and would pay however much was charged. I knew the client better; I objected and told the manager that didn't make any sense, and he said,\"Welcome to the [[Real World]].\" A few weeks later, the project was ended prematurely, partly due to overspending. -- [[Jesse Millikan]]",

Then they pretend to have a [[Real Life]] to which they want to return as early as possible, rubbishing their current activity, ignoring the fact, that all parts of their lives are real, including the too abstract or boring ones, spend in front of any screen. Actually [[Real Life]] finds its short caesura only in the moment of death, until getting [[Re Born]]. The only lives not real are those of fictional persons, persons not real. -- [[Manorainjan Holzapfel]]",
