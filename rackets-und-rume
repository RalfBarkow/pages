Previous contributions to the debate in this newspaper [jungle.world] have criticized such a view, interpreting the war rather as a reaction to internal crises of the authoritarian Russian model of rule. Putin's specific authoritarianism was also placed in a general tendency toward authoritarianism, which originated in the course of the global capitalist crisis process and had arrived in the capitalist heartland at the latest with the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump; among the losers of capitalist competition, this tendency took on particularly regressive forms. Against this backdrop, the contrast in values and systems between West and East, which is now being invoked again, becomes recognizable as an ideological imagination, since this idea does not depict the contrast between universal freedom and human rights on the one hand and their absence on the other, but rather conceals the connection between the two models."

[[Volker Weiß]] described this in his book \"The Authoritarian Revolt\" with the motif of the \"enemy in space and form\" in New Right thinking. In Putin's version, the space in question is a historically grown Russian sphere that is to be defended against Western influence and alleged plans for dismemberment and is determined not only geostrategically, but above all by cultural-identitarian thinking in imperial categories. The figure of the enemy is an imaginary West that threatens to dissolve Russian identity as an external and internal danger. This is defined by allegedly traditional values of culture, religion and binary-hierarchical gender order, which are threatened by the universal principles of human rights and individual freedoms marked as \"Western."

It is no coincidence that the same homophobic cipher for the threat to the traditional order of values by social-cultural modernization is used here as in his war speech against the external enemy quoted above. The addressees of this tirade were only superficially Western-liberal-minded oligarchs who refuse to be loyal to Putin, but ultimately the entire democratically-minded and intellectual opposition - the \"Russian people\" would \"spit out\" this \"scum\" in an act of \"self-purification\" like a fly that accidentally got into its mouth."

For Putin, turning to the liberal West is such a betrayal. It is also why, since he first became president, he has cracked down on Western-liberal oligarchs like [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]] as well as human rights groups and civil society opposition, all of whom he says are \"foreign agents.\" That is why, in 2014, he began to wage war on Ukraine, which, through its orientation toward the EU initiated by the \"Orange Revolution\" and the Euromaidan, in a sense lacked the loyalty it owed to Russia and committed treason."

Putin and his ruling class are obviously obsessively driven by narcissistic affronts to an imperial Russian self-image, caused by the dissolution of the Soviet Union as well as the previous decline of the tsarist empire. Universalist principles attributed to the \"collective West\" are blamed for both; Putin wants to redeem Russia from this ignominy and lead it to old and new greatness. This worldview means no less than that Putin and his entourage hate the emancipatory-enlightenment moments of modernity in a manner similar to militant Islamists or, precisely, the right-wing extremists in the West who are oriented toward the so-called [[Conservative Revolution]]. Seen in this light, the war of aggression against Ukraine is armed identity politics from the right with a nuclear option."

It is no coincidence that the same homophobic cipher for the threat to the traditional order of values by social-cultural modernization is used here as in his war speech against the external enemy quoted above. The addressees of this tirade were only superficially Western-liberal-minded oligarchs who refuse to be loyal to Putin, but ultimately the entire democratically-minded and intellectual opposition - the \"Russian people\" would \"spit out\" this \"scum\" in an act of \"self-purification\" like a fly that accidentally got into its mouth."
