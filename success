Let me sharpen that a little bit. Let’s say when we’re adding those features that it’s still a sound economic proposition – the cost of adding the new features doesn’t escalate because the program has somehow not turned into an architectural mess and that’s what we’re trying to avoid. I would say when the time is right we can take what we’ve learned so far and fold that back into the program to keep the program healthy and fit throughout its lifetime. And we want these programs to be successful and we want them to grow so that we don’t have to throw them away prematurely and start over from scratch, and repeat all the same mistakes again."
