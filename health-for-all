      "text": "When the Covid-19 pandemic arrived in 2020, it encountered public healthcare systems under strain across the world, after decades of austerity. The pandemic exposed well-worn fault-lines of socio-economic inequality between countries and regions, and within states. It underlined how injustices along racial, class, gendered and geographical lines remain entrenched, and in many places have worsened - drawing attention to questions of who gets sick, who dies, who is vulnerable, and why (e.g. Carney et al., 2022). The pandemic also made apparent extensive failures in attempts to provide healthcare to all. Just as the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic was a symptom of a larger global health crisis, in large part due to a lack of investment in health systems on the African continent (Packard, 2016), so the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the fragile state of health systems and the unequal access to healthcare around the globe, including in some of the world’s wealthiest economies. The medical and economic havoc caused by the virus refocused attention on health systems, and highlighted the vital role of both public healthcare, and arguments for creating truly universal, publicly-funded health services that reach and include everyone (see Yates, 2020; Whittall, 2020).

Across the world, hopes for providing ‘health for all’ were central to nation building in the long 20th century, and for international relations, particularly after the second world war and the establishment of the WHO. Health became seen as a fundamental good by citizens of North and South and has remained a central force shaping global and national politics until today. But what does ‘health for all’ actually mean, and how did it come to matter? In this introduction we approach ‘health for all as a situated, multi-faceted phenomenon, that - while having a shared aspiration towards universality of access and equality of care - comes into focus in partial, diverse and contentious policies, programmes, projects and practices. Beyond homogenising narratives that frame ‘health for all’ in terms of either success or failure, the special issue highlights the diverse iterations that ‘health for all’ has taken on the ground for different subjects and groups of people, exploring exclusions and limitations as well as dreams and aspirations."
