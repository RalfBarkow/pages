Cymatic therapy was believed by its earliest advocates to be effective in treating such diverse conditions as arthritis, gout, rheumatic diseases, sciatica and slipped vertebral disk. More recently, cymatic therapy has been re-examined by mainstream medical practitioners, in particular orthopedic surgeons, as it may accelerate the healing of bone fractures, relieve musculoskeletal tension and have a positive impact on sports injuries.
