The Dutch graphic artist (1898-1972) continues to inspire filmmakers, painters and musicians alike.\nThe documentary \"M.C.

After a long period in which he created mainly traditional works, he made his breakthrough after World War II with his signature \"Escher prints.\" In these works, Escher shows a world that seems logical at first glance, but then turns out to be completely impossible in reality. In the film, 3D animations show how Escher gave shape to ideas in his prints and how his thought and work process gradually developed. His works are immediately recognizable. Where he drew his inspiration from, how he lived, who the ingenious graphic artist was who worked obsessively and ultimately amazed the world, the film tells. But it was probably Escher himself who was most amazed by his great success, especially among the young.\n\n\n\nDocumentary by [[Robin Lutz]] (NL 2018, 58 min)\n"
