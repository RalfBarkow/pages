Was passiert, ist die Gleichsetzung von physisch völlig unterschiedlichen Waren in einer Tauschgleichung. Die Waren an sich sind nicht gleich, der Tausch setzt sie gleich. Im Tauschakt wird nicht die Gleichheit zweier Waren erzeugt, sondern ihre Gleichwertigkeit, ihre Äquivalenz. In dieser Realabstraktion, in der durch die Tauschhandlung erzeugten Äquivalenz vermutet Sohn-Rethel, verkürzt gesagt, die soziogenetische Grundlegung des mathematischen Äquivalenzbegriffes."
