These footnotes are a place of nuance and politics, where the protocols of gratitude and recognition play out (sometimes also called [[Citation]]), where warnings and care work are carried out (including calling certain readers aside for a chat or a joke), and where I (Max Liboiron) contextualize, expand, and emplace work. The footnotes support the text above, representing the shoulders on which I stand and the relations I want to build. They are part of doing good relations within a text, through a text. Since a main goal of [[Pollution Is Colonialism]] is to show how methodology is a way of being in the world and that ways of being are tied up in [[Obligation]], these footnotes are one way to enact that argument. Thank you to Duke University Press for these footnotes."
