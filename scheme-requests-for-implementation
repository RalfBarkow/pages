Its a lot easier to go from an executable high-level Scheme phrasing of a solution to a practical, effective program in Guile than standard-compliant Scheme. This reflects highly on Scheme and the Guile implementation; they have both done an uncanny job of satisfying their initial, and very different, design goals.
