When the parliament refused to do so, he had the military fire on the seat of the Supreme Soviet a short time later. At that time, there was no civil war. But there remained no doubt as to how the now nominally democratic Russian leadership envisioned dealing with an opposition that would not allow itself to be instrumentalized as a tame appendage of the new nomenklatura. In 1996, Yeltsin won the presidential election yet again, not least because of the hastily decided payment of large wage arrears.

The beginning of the second Chechen war, which was fought with great brutality and caused violent police practices to spread throughout the country in the following years, coincided with Putin's rise from head of the domestic intelligence service to prime minister in August 1999. A few weeks after his inauguration, in September, more than 300 people were killed in explosions in apartment buildings in Moscow, Volgodonsk and Buynaksk. It was never clearly established who was behind the attacks, but on television, which was still run by so-called oligarchs at the time, it was still possible to discuss the matter without mincing words, unlike today. Also about highly suspicious circumstantial evidence of a failed intelligence operation in Ryazan, which the then director of the domestic intelligence service FSB, Nikolay Patrushev, described in retrospect as an \"exercise\".

Authorities never made public the exact composition of the gas used to subdue the hostage-takers before the storming. In September 2004, more than 300 people died after another hostage-taking by North Caucasian terrorists at a school in Beslan. How much a human life is worth to the Russian state could be seen not only in the high number of victims in the liberations, but also in the intensive efforts to obstruct processing as much as possible. Such experiences of violence remain in the public's memory for a long time. Repression also occurred in independent Ukraine, but never on a comparable scale."

At the same time, his significantly diminished public presence in the past two years gave rise to speculation about a possible imminent transfer of power; instead of the image conveyed by the media of a wise president who impresses with well-orchestrated state control, there was a medially unspectacular administrative apparatus that apparently did its job even without daily televised instructions from the president. Now, however, there is no longer any thought of the 69-year-old Putin retiring any time soon."

Although he is trying to collect what can be collected from the periphery, this does not result in an entity with a common concept for the future. In Putin's mind, as the ruler of a great power, he has long been waging a defensive war against the advancing United States, with Ukraine as the battlefield. Over the years, it has become increasingly urgent to resume security talks with the U.S., but Putin's actions in Ukraine have destroyed the basis for this. One can speculate whether the current war could have been avoided or postponed by a sincere U.S. willingness to negotiate. But even after a cease-fire, which Russia is currently negotiating with Ukraine, the danger of a possible follow-up war would not have been averted."

Nor does the Putin care much about the opinion of the oligarchs, who became rich under Yeltsin and even richer under himself. Unlike the conservative leadership in the military, secret service and other state apparatuses, they do not hide their displeasure with Putin's go-it-alone attitude. But even if things begin to simmer in the apparatus, it can only be hoped that Putin's armed forces suffer a defeat and that the reservoir from which he draws his ideas sinks into the melting water of the permafrost of northern Siberia."

Like Yeltsin in his day, Putin also had to deal with the idea of settling his future and his succession. In a lightning move, he had the population vote on a constitutional amendment in the first pandemic summer of 2020 in order to be able to serve additional terms. At the same time, his significantly diminished public presence in the past two years gave rise to speculation about a possible imminent transfer of power; instead of the image conveyed by the media of a wise president who impresses with well-orchestrated state control, there was a medially unspectacular administrative apparatus that apparently did its job even without daily televised instructions from the president. Now, however, there is no longer any thought of the 69-year-old Putin retiring any time soon."

        "text": "It is a popular misconception that Putin is trying to restore the Soviet Union, even if it is under the banner of a \"Russian world,\" i.e., a zone of influence controlled by Russia. Although he is trying to collect what can be collected from the periphery, this does not result in an entity with a common concept for the future. In Putin's mind, as the ruler of a great power, he has long been waging a defensive war against the advancing United States, with Ukraine as the battlefield. Over the years, it has become increasingly urgent to resume security talks with the U.S., but Putin's actions in Ukraine have destroyed the basis for this. One can speculate whether the current war could have been avoided or postponed by a sincere U.S. willingness to negotiate. But even after a cease-fire, which Russia is currently negotiating with Ukraine, the danger of a possible follow-up war would not have been averted."

        "text": "Morally, it would be existentially important for a future dialogue with Ukraine and for the relations of the two countries that the Russian anti-war movement would become stronger, but for the attitude of the Kremlin this anyway improbable development would probably remain meaningless. Nor does the Putin care much about the opinion of the oligarchs, who became rich under Yeltsin and even richer under himself. Unlike the conservative leadership in the military, secret service and other state apparatuses, they do not hide their displeasure with Putin's go-it-alone attitude. But even if things begin to simmer in the apparatus, it can only be hoped that Putin's armed forces suffer a defeat and that the reservoir from which he draws his ideas sinks into the melting water of the permafrost of northern Siberia."
