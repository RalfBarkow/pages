      "text": "In January 1972 a group of Latin Americans, mainly Chileans, Peruvians and Mexicans, met at the Intercultural Documentation Center (CIDOC, short for  Centro  Intercultural  de  Documentación) in Cuernavaca to discuss the following hypothesis: there are technical characteristics in the means of production that make it impossible to control them in a political process. Only a society that accepts the need to choose a common ceiling to certain technical dimensions in its means of production has political alternatives. The thesis discussed had been formulated in a document elaborated in 1971 with Valentina Borremans, co-founder and director of CIDOC. Iván Illich formulated the fundamental lines of this essay in Spanish, English and French and submitted this ideas to groups of doctors, architects, educators and other ideologues; Illich published them in serious journals and in daring little sheets. He is deeply grateful to those who wanted to criticize him and thus helped him to clarify these concepts. Above all, Illich thanks the participants in the seminar at CIDOC in the years 1971-1973, who will recognize in these pages not only their ideas but, very often, their words. This book took its final form as a result of a presentation Illich made to a group of Canadian judges and legislators. There he used for the first time the common law paradigm (paradigma  del  derecho  común anglosajón), which has since been incorporated into the structure of the essay.  He would have liked to have been able to illustrate the same points by referring to the Spanish fueros, but his late discovery postpones trying to do so. \n"
