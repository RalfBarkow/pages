Java replaced Smalltalk-80 in this number two position and then ate it alive. Smalltalk-80 evolved in two directions. The first, based on Smalltalk-80 rel 2 was taken out of Xerox by Adele Goldberg et al. into [[Parc Place]] and renamed [[Object Works]], this was later renamed [[Visual Works]] and is still sold by Cincom. Another version based on Smalltalk-80 rel 1 was evolved by Alan Kay et al. and renamed [[Squeak Smalltalk]]. There is now another branch of Squeak called [[Pharo]] that has aimed to make a more commercial offering. Both Squeak and Pharo are OSS. There are a couple of other implementations worthy of note; IBM's [[Visual Age]] Smalltalk now sold by Instantiations and Dolphin Smalltalk. In recent years with the rise of dynamic languages such as Python and Ruby there has been a renewal of interest in Smalltalk.  As well Ruby is pretty much a Perlized dialect of Smalltalk, so all in all the future of the language is far from dead. ",

The first, based on Smalltalk-80 rel 2 was taken out of Xerox by Adele Goldberg et al. into [[Parc Place]] and renamed [[Object Works]], this was later renamed [[Visual Works]] and is still sold by Cincom. Another version based on Smalltalk-80 rel 1 was evolved by Alan Kay et al. and renamed [[Squeak Smalltalk]]. There is now another branch of Squeak called Pharo that has aimed to make a more commercial offering. Both Squeak and Pharo are OSS. There are a couple of other implementations worthy of note; IBM's [[Visual Age]] Smalltalk now sold by Instantiations and Dolphin Smalltalk. In recent years with the rise of dynamic languages such as Python and Ruby there has been a renewal of interest in Smalltalk.  As well Ruby is pretty much a Perlized dialect of Smalltalk, so all in all the future of the language is far from dead. ",

During the process, the various components of the development environment (such as the compiler and its support classes) were stripped from the packaged image. The result is a fully-functional Smalltalk application that runs independently from the environment. Other approaches, that had varying levels of success, included constructing linkable modules (DLLs in windows, so's or .o's in unix, etc) that ran the application.</i> Modern [[Visual Works]] has a sophisticated parcelling system and deployment tools to allow runtime systems to be deployed.",
