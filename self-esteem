Specifically, this dissertation is about the additional value implicit self-esteem has in understanding self-esteem, one of the most researched concepts in Psychology. I will argue that in order to place the concept of implicit selfesteem within the realms on current research on self-esteem, understanding of both measuring implicit self-esteem and its relation with explicit self-esteem is necessary."

The name letter test consists of judging the different letters of the alphabet on their attractiveness. A name letter effect is then calculated based on attractiveness ratings of someone’s name letters while correcting for specific and general letter liking, in order to avoid confounds. This name letter effect is subsequently used as a measure of implicit self-esteem based on the assumption that by assessing someone’s evaluation of well established attributes of the self (e.g., such as someone’s initial letters) in an unobtrusive way (e.g., under the guise of simply evaluating all alphabet letters), someone’s implicit evaluation of the self is measured."

In three experiments I will show that this (theoretical) confound of overall letter liking indeed is problematic in empirical findings when using the traditional name letter score.
