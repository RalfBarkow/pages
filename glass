While a window is a standardized building commodity, the practices used to manufacture them have evolved dramatically from blast furnace and grinding to Pilkington’s float glass method. In other words, the way we make windows (the practice) has evolved but the window (the result of activity) remains roughly the same. Here we have independence of [[Practice]] and [[Activity]].
