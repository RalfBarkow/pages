The questions that drive her current projects concern the ways in which young people construct their identities with computers, and how computers (and the technology design practices that produced them) shape the identities they construct.

She is also affiliated with the Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Working Group and the Center for Science, Technology, Society and Policy.\n\nHer PhD is in communication (with a minor in anthropology) from Stanford, where her dissertation won the Nathan Maccoby Outstanding Dissertation Award.

Her core theoretical areas include science and technology studies, anthropology, cultural studies, information studies, media studies, communication, data and algorithm studies, and human-computer interaction.
