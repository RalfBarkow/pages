      "text": "The success of this model of bureaucracy can best be explained historically. It opposes arbitrariness at all levels of order, it concentrates arbitrariness at the top, which is then assumed to be disciplined by its own value relationships and environmental conditions – in the economy by the market and in public administration by politics bound by the rule of law. Bureaucracy also means that large work units can be formed in which many people work together simultaneously and yet in a coordinated manner. And above all, in this form the socially prescribed hierarchy can be replaced by the principle of equality. Bureaucracy assumes equality both in external relations and in its internal relationships - unless the organization itself makes a difference. All of this takes account of the immense complexity of modern society, both in reality and in its theoretical modeling - in a form that could be described in terms of system theory as differentiation within society, as the differentiation of an independent and yet controllable system that can be adjusted, coordinated and \"controlled\" in line with social interests."
