I had been involved in an new innovative undergraduate teacher education program as the principal of a [[Teaching School]]. Based on the idea of the medical profession's 'Teaching Hospital' this was a program designed to close the gap between theory and practice through a partnership between the profession and the university tasked with preparing, and credentialing graduate teachers."

      "text": "I was subsequently recruited to join the university and offered the opportunity to contribute to the expansion of the program. Essentially, the program had been running on one of the university's campuses, a greenfield site, and was underpinned by a partnership between the school district, the local council and the university. This partnership, without the restrictive structures and bureaucratic restrictions of an established university, was attracting national and international attention."

I was tasked with rolling out the program on the other six regional campuses. This excited me greatly. I believed in the approach, felt privileged to be involved in such a transformational undertaking, but was not prepared for the extent of resistance and subterfuge undertaken by academics within the university."

      "text": "Despite the positive attention being received this was a bitter experience, one that surprised me. The faculty executive wanted the change. The faculty didn't. And I was the outsider, at the time without the required academic qualification, trying to effect the change. I learned a great deal about the importance of culture, the clarity of purpose in change processes, the potential the middle levels of an organisation holds, egos in academia and the power of the status quo. When my contract was up for renewal I decided to return to school leadership. The university happily dismantled the innovation within a couple of years."

Based on the idea of the medical profession's 'Teaching Hospital' this was a program designed to close the gap between theory and practice through a partnership between the profession and the university tasked with preparing, and credentialing graduates."

        "text": "The program had been reviewed independently, and extremely favourbly,  by the Australian Council for Educational Research, highlighted in a federal government review of teacher education and touted as the model of the future. I was tasked with rolling out the program on the other six regional campuses. This excited me greatly. I believed in the approach, felt privileged to be involved in such a transformational undertaking, but was not prepared for the extent of resistance and subterfuge undertaken by academics within the university."

I learned a great deal about the importance of culture, the clarity of purpose in change processes, the potential the middle levels of an organisation holds, egos in academia and the power of the status quo. When my contract was up for renewal I decided to return to school leadership."
