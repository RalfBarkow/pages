Their rent seeking is based on overcharging prices, undercutting competition—by exploiting particular advantages, e.g., labour, or using a monopoly advantage. Where value creation refers to the use of different types of resources to produce new goods and services, value extraction is defined as “activities focused on moving around existing resources and outputs, and gaining disproportionally from the ensuing trade” (Mazzucato 2018: 6).

Sadowski (2019: 9) defines data extraction as: “data is taken without meaningful consent and fair compensation for the producers and sources of data”. Evgeny Morozov (2018) follows a similar line of thinking and has coined *[[data extractivism]]* to refer to practices of tech giants launching products not for the revenue but for the data, which is afterwards monetised through different products and services (see also Couldry and Mejias 2019).
