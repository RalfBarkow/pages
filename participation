Nor does it attempt to present reality in the form of an abbreviated overview – just as a [[Map]] does the country. The intention is beyond the classical division of normative and descriptive theories. Rather, the point is to show that a theoretical text can produce more cognitive consistency than is apparent in the everyday operation of systems. In this sense, the text seeks to enlighten – and it does so by processing distinctions of its own. But of course of distinctions that distinguish the distinctions of organizations."

The answer is provided by the notion of absorption of uncertainty. This might suggest the view that organizations transform uncertainty into certainty by linking decisions. While this is true, it is not sufficient to understand the reflective and autonomous potential of organizations. This is served by the distinction between decisions and decision premises, which allows for double closure of the system at the operational and structural levels, and double closure is generally a condition for reflection. Finally, decision premises are distinguished in themselves according to different types, namely decision programs, personnel, and communication channels that translate competencies (division of labor) into decision contexts."

In this meaning, theory is concerned with the resolution of this paradox of observing, on the level of its object as well as on the level of the theory itself, that is, externally referential and self-referentially. And only in this insight lies the connection of theory with its object. Thus, we do not presuppose principles of nature or reason, nor do we presuppose a concept of truth that promises any \"adequate\" linkage of these two components of cognition. The premise of organization is the unknownness of the future, and the success of organizations lies in dealing with this uncertainty: its increase, its specification, and the reduction of its cost."

        "text": "Models for this could be found in Hegel's dialectic. It achieves the representation of self-organization (of spirit) by conceiving distinctions as opposites and opposites as unstable. Therefore, having rejected subject theory as one-sided, it can envisage construction only as the abolition of opposites. This has well-known consequences. Another example would be George Spencer Brown's calculus of forms. He presents in the form of a mathematical calculus how forms (marked distinctions) come to observe themselves. Whereas the Hegelian dialectic ends with the concept completing its work and coming to itself, the calculus of forms ends with it exploding its own calculability and reaching a state that can only be described as \"unresolvable indeterminacy,\" requiring imaginary worlds, time, memory, and free space to oscillate for further processing. The system thus becomes an unpredictable historical machine with an unpredictable future."

Moreover, with the help of the theoretical core, we can try to assess what barriers arise for self-change and self-reflection efforts of the organization; or, in other words, how real organizations differ from ideal concepts of arbitrary changeability and complete self-transparency. And finally, it can be shown that and why organizations that generate and operationally close themselves in this way are different from the social system that enables them because it enables communication; that uses them to coordinate communications of the most diverse kinds, and that nevertheless can neither direct nor control the organizations."

Nor does it attempt to present reality in the form of an abbreviated overview – just as a [[Map]] does the country. The intention is beyond the classical division of normative and descriptive theories. Rather, the point is to show that a theoretical text can produce more cognitive consistency than is apparent in the everyday operation of systems. In this sense, the text seeks to enlighten – and it does so by processing distinctions of its own. But of course of distinctions that distinguish the distinctions of organizations."

But even then, there still remains the question of how an organization determines what it can do in the face of such dependencies. Or, in other words, how it can construct freedoms, alternatives, dispositional latitude into the dependencies on its environment and into the dependencies on its own past. It seems that we can expect a need for orientation here. And if this assumption is correct, then the starting point would have to lie in the question of "
