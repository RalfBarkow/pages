The Jewish master butcher ran a store on Leimenstrasse. He is a brother of the Guild of Butchers and a member of the Liberal Democratic Party. He sat for the LDP in the Basel Grand Council from 1991 to 1998. Nationally, Hess made headlines in the mid-1990s as the \"Knight of the Road\" after providing first aid in accidents. In 1999, he received a medal from the Carnegie Foundation for Lifesavers from the then President of the Swiss Confederation, Ruth Dreifuss."

The Zurich police wrote in their arrest report: \"At the time of his arrest, the person was wearing a wristwatch of the inscribed Breitling brand. The state of authenticity and value could not be verified. Since the person wanted to enter Switzerland with it, the Federal Customs Administration was notified.\""

Hess only learned the reason for his arrest after he had been transferred to the Waaghof remand prison in Basel the next day. He was not accused of smuggling or even murder and manslaughter, but - \"false accusation\". The offense is described in Article 303 of the Swiss Penal Code as follows: \"Whoever accuses a non-guilty person, against his better knowledge, of a crime or misdemeanor before the authorities, with the intention of bringing about a criminal prosecution against him, shall be punished with imprisonment or a fine.\"\n\nThe story took its fateful course on Nov. 24, 2016, when Hess dialed the number of Baschi Dürr, then head of the Basel Justice and Security Department, in Jerusalem. Dürr's secretary took the call. Hess explained that he had to report a child abduction. His daughter-in-law F. I. (name known to the editors) had kidnapped her son from Jerusalem to Basel."

I. told the officers that she would have liked to inform her husband about her plans, but he had gone into hiding. She had therefore not been able to contact him. Marcel Hess denies this: \"She would have had the possibility to reach her husband via us parents at any time.\" On November 25, 2016, F. I. filed charges against Hess for false accusation. Officially, F. I. was still married at the time. It was not until July 2017 that the Rabbinical Court in Jerusalem finalized the divorce and awarded F. I. sole custody. "

After all, Hess is \"a well-known former member of the Basel City Council, he owns a property in Basel and pays taxes there. He was therefore available to the Stawa at all times, and an arrest would therefore have been unnecessary. Hess also says: \"It would have been enough to take my passport and ask me to report to the Stawa the next day.\""

He is demanding an administrative investigation and compensation from Marcel Hess at the expense of the canton of Basel-Stadt. In response to an inquiry from BaZ, the Stawa stated that it does not comment on pending proceedings. And the Department of Justice and Police writes: \"The accusation of anti-Semitism is serious, of course such accusations are investigated.\" Regarding the accusation that Hess was denied kosher food, the department writes that only in the case of \"longer stays\" in the Waaghof, \"of course, one takes into account eating habits and religious rules."
