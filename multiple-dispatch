Declaring a variable of some base class and assigning it a derived instance is a classic OO idiom (not just Java) used in contexts where polymorphism is implemented via inheritance rather than by interface, i.e., in cases where your algorithms work with an abstraction (the base class) that is implemented by one or more concrete derivations of the base class.  While the original example is perhaps not the best illustration of the lack of multiple dispatch, it is perfectly acceptable code.  The way Appraiser is used is quite typical on occasions where the classes to be appraised (Tractor and Vehicle) may not be modified for whatever reason.  A more appropriate application of multiple dispatch is in implementing the [[Visitor Pattern]] as part of a language parser for a complex grammar; in the absence of multiple dispatch it requires an awkward festoonment of class and method declarations.</i>",
