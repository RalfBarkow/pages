For the Du-8 is also unambiguous (for Du). This third, then, comes from a place that is outside of the I-reference system, that is, outside of the logical realm to which we are currently referring. Speaking with Hegel, the distinction between the I-element and the Thou-element requires a \"second negation\", which is not only the doubling of a simple negation within the logical system (and thus would lead us back to the starting point), but which points out of this system to a second logical system. Thus, in the proper sense, it is not only about multi-valued logic, but also about a \"multi-logical value\". Since classical logic has no place for such a triadic constellation, where two reference systems intersect or interlace in one point, \"transclassical\" logical procedures have been searched again and again as a way out of the classical logical closure.\n"

Even if both use the same terms, these are always individually linked (occupied) with different, albeit similar, contents of consciousness and therefore different and unique. However, if language creates an interpersonal space in which only what we call \"I\" or \"subject\" emerges - as a synthesis of I and Thou, or even of inside and outside - then this process necessarily leads beyond the limits of classical logic: consciousness as a unity of mind and perspective of action must then be seen simultaneously as unity and as difference. All philosophers have basically worked on this paradox and sought answers for it. Kant argues primarily for the non-identity of understanding and perspective of action, while Hegel tries to bring their identity together in a dialectical relation and to abolish it at the same time. Charles S. Peirce, in turn, sought to describe the logical process of how we build this bridge to an external world.\n"

However, the successes of logic, especially in scientific explanation, technical mechanization, and finally industrialization, pushed these problems into the background for a long time. It is true that theologians feared for a time the public advance of a secular Aristotelian logic because of its possible negative effects on the faith and thus on the power position of the church. The scholastics, for example, who sought to integrate Aristotle and reconcile reason with faith, were therefore long suspected of heresy. Nevertheless, at least in the West, the triumph of logic as the only legitimate way of thinking was unstoppable. "

Günther calls such a system of reference a \"contextur\". For him, a dialogical or dialectical logic must be able to integrate several contextures, it must be \"polycontextural\". However, Günther does not only want to discuss the problem of the formalizability of dialectics theoretically, but to solve it practically: He wants to develop an operational formalism or calculus in the form of a \"polycontextural operator\" and on this basis even build a completely new kind of computer, as we know it so far only from science fiction movies and novels."

They break the logical containment and are complex in this sense, because they cannot be completely described within a single logic.\n\nEvery dialogue creates such a polylogical situation: In the dialogue two individuals meet whose spaces of consciousness as reference systems are in principle inaccessible to the other. Even if both use the same terms, these are always individually linked (occupied) with different, albeit similar, contents of consciousness and therefore different and unique. However, if language creates an interpersonal space in which only what we call \"I\" or \"subject\" emerges - as a synthesis of I and Thou, or even of inside and outside - then this process necessarily leads beyond the limits of classical logic: consciousness as a unity of mind and perspective of action must then be seen simultaneously as unity and as difference. All philosophers have basically worked on this paradox and sought answers for it. Kant argues primarily for the non-identity of understanding and perspective of action, while Hegel tries to bring their identity together in a dialectical relation and to abolish it at the same time. Charles S. Peirce, in turn, sought to describe the logical process of how we build this bridge to an external world.\n\nThat logic, precisely because it is unambiguous, formalizable and determinable at every step, does not lead to unified conclusions, at the latest in dialogue, was already known to the early logicians. However, the successes of logic, especially in scientific explanation, technical mechanization, and finally industrialization, pushed these problems into the background for a long time.

        "text": "Every dialogue creates such a polylogical situation: In the dialogue two individuals meet whose spaces of consciousness as reference systems are in principle inaccessible to the other. Even if both use the same terms, these are always individually linked (occupied) with different, albeit similar, contents of consciousness and therefore different and unique. However, if language creates an interpersonal space in which only what we call \"I\" or \"subject\" emerges - as a synthesis of I and Thou, or even of inside and outside - then this process necessarily leads beyond the limits of classical logic: consciousness as a unity of mind and perspective of action must then be seen simultaneously as unity and as difference. All philosophers have basically worked on this paradox and sought answers for it. Kant argues primarily for the non-identity of understanding and perspective of action, while Hegel tries to bring their identity together in a dialectical relation and to abolish it at the same time. Charles S. Peirce, in turn, sought to describe the logical process of how we build this bridge to an external world.\n"
