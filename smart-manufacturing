      "text": "The concept of smart manufacturing has existed in literature since 1980, but in recent years has gained more interest due to the growth of digital technologies and the integration of information and operational technologies within industrial environments [1]. Industry 4.0 tends to leverage different enabling technologies for reaching high levels of productivity by transforming traditional organizations in smart and hyperconnected business models. Moreover, the increasing competition, the need to reduce the time to market and to increase innovation require the organization to continuously adapt and its behavior to respond to this dynamically changing context [2]. The concept of digital twin was introduced for the first time by Grieves [3], in 2003, with the Information Mirror Model for explaining the elements that compose this virtual reflective model. The author defines the digital twin as “a sensor-enabled digital model of a physical object that simulates the object in a live setting” [4]. In this context, the digital twin is recognized as one of the most promising and emerging technologies for supporting and changing a traditional factory in a smart shop floor, focused on achieving high production efficiency, low production costs, and high product and process quality. Several other benefits coming from the adoption of this technology are currently recognized: from the improvement of operations to the optimization of production quality and costs and the shortening of product development, and from the early verification and validation of production processes to the possibility to develop innovative services [5,6]."
