It is impossible for us in this sense to be \"non-creative\" or \"non-innovative\". Creativity and innovation are basic conditions of life. If we delegate creativity as a special property to artists and inventors, it is only because our society, which is oriented towards logic and predictability, expects us first and foremost to behave as regularly, reliably and predictably as possible. For this purpose, children are sent to school, we learn laws and rules of the game, norms and moral concepts, until we are convinced that creativity is only in good hands with artists and inventors.\n"
