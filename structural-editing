I’m also going to present such a tool, based on neuroscience of programming and mental maps.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\nIvan Daniluk (@idanyliuk) is a senior software engineer and has more than a decade of experience in writing networking software for the security market. He’s an active member of the Go community, a conference speaker (most recently at GopherCon 2016 and OSCON 2016), the host of the GolangShow podcast, and organizer of Golang meetups, the author of numerous articles about Go, and the author of a few popular projects for Gophers. Ivan enjoys helping people to learn about Go and programming and is highly interested in neural networks, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, visualizations, and new approaches to education in general. His hobbies include figure skating, the Argentine tango, yachting, and astronomy."

I’m also going to present such a tool, based on neuroscience of programming and mental maps.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\nIvan Daniluk (@idanyliuk) is a senior software engineer and has more than a decade of experience in writing networking software for the security market. He’s an active member of the Go community, a conference speaker (most recently at GopherCon 2016 and OSCON 2016), the host of the GolangShow podcast, and organizer of Golang meetups, the author of numerous articles about Go, and the author of a few popular projects for Gophers. Ivan enjoys helping people to learn about Go and programming and is highly interested in neural networks, artificial intelligence, neuroscience, visualizations, and new approaches to education in general.
