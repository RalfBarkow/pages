      "text": "We know joy. We want joy. But we rarely speak of it and we rarely expect it.\n\nBrené Brown talks about joy as being our most vulnerable emotion. She is so right.\n\nRecently I was watching the movie Most Likely to Succeed with a group of parents and educators. They were looking to find inspiration from that movie to help guide a courageous conversation about reimagining education in their school district.\n\nThe story of the students and the teachers from High Tech High finding purpose in their learning is deeply moving. But most of all, it is the joy in their eyes that you feel.\n\nI noticed, however, that not a single person in the movie explicitly talked about joy. They talked around it, but not about it. And I wondered why.\n\nSo in the panel discussion after the movie, as I sat in front of this audience, I asked the question: Why are we afraid to talk about joy, when we know that it is really what we desire in the learning experience? And in our lives.\n\nAre we afraid to name joy because we feel that we don’t deserve it? Or is that we don’t want to be robbed of it? I suspect the former.\n\nWe need to become fearless if real change is going to happen in our schools, in our companies, and in our lives. We need to talk about joy. We need to claim joy as our birthright, that which makes us whole and unleashes our creative genius. It is our truth. We need to shout it from the mountains.\n\nI learned this lesson from my work in the Dayton school district — a community that, under the leadership of a fearless principal, audaciously aspired to reimagine education.\n\nI worked with Jami Fluke, their principal, to introduce the mindsets and skillsets of Agile to inspire new learning experiences in the school. Experiences that mirrored the fast learning cycles that are driving innovation in our high-growth technology companies.\n\nIt worked, the school was transformed. And, in the process, so was its community. It wasn’t transformed by Agile practices, but by tapping into the Essence of Agile, the joy that bursts forth during Eureka Moments. That joy became infectious and touched everyone. It could not be denied. It was real. And when that joy was threatened, the community fought back. With all of their heart.\n\nOne evening, with beers in our hands, we were reflecting on this journey. At the table with us was Ward Cunningham, one of the original signers of the Agile Manifesto. We were exploring parallels between the experiences in Dayton with the experiences that he and Kent Beck had when they were working together at Tektronix back in the mid-nineties. Experiences that led to the development of Extreme Programming (XP) and Agile.\n\nWhat were we to call that shared experience that bound together different communities and different times? And then Jami hit on it: “The Joyful Sandbox”. I looked over at Ward and his eyes lit up. Yes, that is what he was experiencing with Kent as they experimented with pair programming using a new language called Smalltalk. That experience became the catalyst for a profound transformation in the software industry and beyond.\n\nOur society has foisted on us two great fallacies. One is that we are not, each and every one of us, geniuses. Genius, in its original Latin definition, means innate spirit. We all have a unique, innate spirit. We all have genius. It is the gift that we are bringing to the world that gives our life meaning.\n\nThe second fallacy is that we don’t deserve joy. For far too many, to become an adult implies that we must discard joy and suffer through a work world in a quest simply to survive. Far too often, a joyless journey.\n\nBut to thrive and to become whole, we must claim joy. For our children, for us. For our coworkers. For our friends. For strangers.\n\nAsk yourself, what is your joy? That truth will set you free."
