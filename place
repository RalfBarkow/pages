The critics of the Enlightenment characterized this variation in a centered, particularistic manner emphasizing the individuality of cultural communities. Aspects of both views were interwoven into late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century social thought. For example, German liberal theorists associated with the \"return to Kant\" sought, in part, to accommodate the provincialism of national culture groups to the cosmopolitanism of Kant. The German historian Friedrich Meinecke highlighted this tension in his 1907 study of nationalism: […]"

Specific place refers to the conceptual fusion of space and experience that gives areas of the earth's surface a \"wholeness\" or an \"individuality.\" I shall introduce this concept by first offering a general overview of the idea of [[Place as Context]], a view that incorporates both the existential qualities of our experience of place and also our sense of place as a natural \"object\" in the world. This dualistic quality of place has been at the center of the conception of geography as a chorological science that addresses the relationship of people to their environment."

Before discussing narrative, I shall critically examine recent attempts to mediate these axes through theory."
