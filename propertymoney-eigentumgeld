In consequence, others are motivated to accept in their own experience the owner’s very specific selections and not to intervene — even when these selections limit their opportunities to dispose of the objects.

It becomes more likely that everyone but the owner accepts to be excluded from the enjoyment of a [[commodity]] and accepts the owner’s selections, because every use of money is at the same time a transfer of that money to others, i.e., the circulation of property.\n"

The positive value (ownership) is duplicated, generating the code payment/non-payment: ownership of money can be used to execute or not a payment. It becomes more likely that everyone but the owner accepts to be excluded from the enjoyment of a [[commodity]] and accepts the owner’s selections, because every use of money is at the same time a transfer of that money to others, i.e., the circulation of property.\n"
