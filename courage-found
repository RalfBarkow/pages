In my story, I hope I have conveyed that it's been a joy to watch others 'come alive' and to be learning collectively from that experience. The story is being told, and I'm excited to be involved with it. Finding the courage to lean into the work of a 'Learning Architect' now inspires me and has become an important part of my story. "
