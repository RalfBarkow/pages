At best, they may act as more or less capable foster parents—on salary. Getting our neighborhoods out of foster “care” programs as soon as possible is critical to the wellbeing of the neighborhood, its households, and to society. Let's stop this unnecessary infantilization of our neighborhoods through external organizations attempting to provide false parenthood which engenders co-dependency rather than capability."
