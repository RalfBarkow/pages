For example, if we hold to the principle of ' purpose ' - believing that learning happens best when situated in real contexts for authentic purposes - then we have to question the use of random worksheet exercises such as word mazes or fill-the-gap texts. 'Busy work' like this does not support any inquiry learning principles and is therefore off the menu for the inquiry teacher. When teaching with an inquiry mindset, we shift the way we teach."
