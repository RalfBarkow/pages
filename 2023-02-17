Our central theory of change - alternative forking - takes problems of the present, finds underexplored historical and contemporary alternatives, and develops real-world, applicable forks. To achieve this, we combine a decade of institutional understanding of digital security, systems theory, and strategic thinking with a participatory and international congress of collaborators drawn from diverse regions, cultures, and subcultures."

Beer accepted the invitation and the project started with the configuration of a transdisciplinary team and a branch of several Chilean and foreign institutions, like INTEC (Institute of Technology), ECOM (Computer Company of Chile), together with important theorists, scientists and designers such as Raul Espejo, Gui Bonsiepe, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, among others. They developed the interface, software, technical implementation and the training of the people who will compile and transmit the data, a group compound by engineers and common workers."
