        "text": "After this first attempt and after this thoroughly positive colouring, the 19th century made use of the concept of organization primarily at the level of social theory. Modern, post-revolutionary society sought its own form – partly in contrast to the aristocratic societies of the European tradition, partly as a defensive concept against the unrest caused by the French Revolution. It is about reconstruction on new, promising foundations. \"La philosophie du siede dernier a ete revolutionnaire, celle du XIXe siede doit etre organisatrice\",6 Saint-Simon proclaimed his programme, and Auguste Comte would endow the same idea with characteristics such as \"scientificity\", \"positivity\" and \"sociology\". Despite the conscious search for historical distance and a new, reliable program, the conceptual elements of ordering parts into a functioning whole remain intact. However, the concept of organization now also separates out desiderata such as \"social\" and \"solidarity\",7 which have a good chance of expressing the inadequacy of mere organization and becoming desideratum concepts, even oppositional concepts. A company should, as they say today, also take care of the social concerns of its employees – as if joint work is not yet \"social\" without further ado. While retaining its original characteristics, the concept of organization now runs into a bifurcation when applied to society. It marks an inadequacy, a dissatisfaction with the typical characteristics of modern society, together with concepts such as commodity, market, exchange and finally money. In 1887, Tönnies published \"Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft\" (Community and Society), a publication whose unconventional terminology was not very successful, but whose dualization captured the mood of the times and had a formative effect for a long time. Parsons would still organize his \"pattern variables\" according to this pattern."
