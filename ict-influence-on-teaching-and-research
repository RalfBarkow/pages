They do not establish the university as a distributed or virtual organisation. The migration is a one-time decision and is then made permanent for a few semesters or years. Students are present at the destination of their migration decision for a longer period of time, and they intensify the character of the university as an interactional event and organisation that knows how to represent the intellectual and interpersonal complexity of the world in a limited place. For the connection between ICT and the internationalisation of the university – at the level of its student population – this means that no ICT needs specific to it arise from this process. Needs arise in terms of linguistic diversification of the university (e.g. English-language teaching), cultural and social integration of immigrant students, but these do not seem to be processes that raise specific ICT needs to any significant extent.\n"

The most important of these workplaces are the laboratory and the library - and to the extent that they are enforced as indispensable workplaces, new kinds of attendance constraints can arise.\n"

While a humanities scholar can in many cases (but not all) do his or her work in the library of another university (and, as a consequence of the [[digitisation]] of texts, perhaps in any other place in the future), a much more restrictive location constraint arises for the natural and technical scientist in the form of attachment to \"his or her\" laboratory. One can easily see this in the fact that the \"Centres of Advanced Studies\" that are emerging worldwide are predominantly institutions of the humanities and social sciences, because only in these disciplines are the necessary mobilities possible."

The other participants in the scientific process are no longer needed only because they function as the scientific community as addressees of the scientific results and because the value of these results ultimately depends on their judgement. They are now increasingly needed because the research work that is the prerequisite for these results can no longer be done without the other scientists. Especially in the case of research that is dependent on technologies, the adequacy expectations for each individual aspect of the required technological competences are increasing. If this becomes the norm, however, research will only be possible with a division of labour, and the necessary others, who have the theoretical, mathematical, instrumental and interdisciplinary competences that cannot be found in one's own laboratory because of its specialisation, will be working in any other place in the world. Spatial distance is now only to a small extent a selection criterion in the search for cooperation partners.\n"

Empirische Studien zeigen, dass die Regelmässigkeit der Nutzung dieser virtuellen Ressourcen durch die Teilnehmer der Veranstaltungen auch zu einem häufigeren Besuch der Präsenzvorlesungen führt und dass diese Kopplung wiederum bessere Prüfungsresultate nach sich zieht.9 Erst wenn die Studierenden bereits eine bestimmte Zeit an dem Vorlesungskurs teilgenommen haben, substituieren sie gelegentlich das Studium der Online-Ressourcen für die tatsächliche Partizipation an der Veranstaltung.10 Und zugleich spricht vieles dafür, dass vom Universitätslehrer bereitgestellte Online-Notizen (Power Point; andere Formen von Zusammenfassungen) die Schwächen ausgleichen können, die auftreten, wenn Studierende beim Mitschreiben allein auf sich gestellt sind.11 Es sind im Prinzip drei Vorlesungsformen zu unterscheiden – die Präsenzvorlesung, die „e-lecture“ (elektronische Notizen plus akustische Aufzeichnung) und die „virtuelle Vorlesung“ (der von der Vorlesungsform abgelöste elektronische Kurs, der mit Möglichkeiten der elektronischen Interaktion ausgestattet wird). Die institutionelle Präferenz der Universität und die persönlichen Präferenzen der Studierenden werden vermutlich auf der Seite der Präsenzvorlesung bleiben. Aber alle Beteiligten wissen um die möglichen Leistungsgewinne der Integration einer dieser Formen in die beiden anderen und werden dafür Lösungen suchen, die mit verfügbaren Zeithaushalten verträglich bleiben.12 "

The institutional preference of the university and the personal preferences of the students will probably remain on the side of the face-to-face lecture. But all parties involved are aware of the potential performance gains of integrating one of these forms with the other two and will seek solutions for this that remain compatible with available time budgets.12"

While a humanities scholar can in many cases (but not all) do his or her work in the library of another university (and, as a consequence of the digitisation of texts, perhaps in any other place in the future), a much more restrictive location constraint arises for the natural and technical scientist in the form of attachment to \"his or her\" laboratory. One can easily see this in the fact that the \"Centres of Advanced Studies\" that are emerging worldwide are predominantly institutions of the humanities and social sciences, because only in these disciplines are the necessary mobilities possible."

Forecasts in this area are almost only possible on a discipline-specific basis. The requirements then depend, for example, on the extent to which a discipline will use simulations in the future or will calculate with large amounts of data and will need correspondingly powerful computers, etc. Because of the discipline-specificity, I am only registering this fact here without being able to deal with it.\n"

Man benötigt die anderen Teilnehmer am wissenschaftlichen Geschehen jetzt nicht mehr nur deshalb, weil sie als scientific community als Adressaten der erarbeiteten wissenschaftlichen Resultate fungieren und weil von ihrem Urteil am Ende der Wert dieser Resultate abhängt. Man benötigt sie jetzt immer mehr auch deshalb, weil man die Forschungsarbeit, die die Voraussetzung dieser Resultate ist, ohne die anderen Wissenschaftler gar nicht mehr zu tun imstande ist. Gerade bei von Technologien abhängiger Forschung steigen die Adäquanzerwartungen an jeden Einzelaspekt der erforderlichen technologischen Kompetenzen. Wenn dies sich durchsetzt, ist aber Forschung nur noch arbeitsteilig möglich, und die jeweils erforderlichen Anderen, die über die theoretischen, mathematischen, instrumentellen, interdisziplinären Kompetenzen verfügen, die im eigenen Labor wegen dessen Spezialisierung prinzipiell nicht angetroffen werden können, sind an beliebigen anderen Orten in der Welt tätig. Räumliche Distanz ist nur noch in geringem Grade ein Auswahlgesichtspunkt bei der Suche nach Kooperationspartnern.21"

The other participants in the scientific process are no longer needed only because they function as the scientific community as addressees of the scientific results and because the value of these results ultimately depends on their judgement. They are now increasingly needed because the research work that is the prerequisite for these results can no longer be done without the other scientists. Especially in the case of research that is dependent on technologies, the adequacy expectations for each individual aspect of the required technological competences are increasing. If this becomes the norm, however, research will only be possible with a division of labour, and the necessary others, who have the theoretical, mathematical, instrumental and interdisciplinary competences that cannot be found in one's own laboratory because of its specialisation, will be working in any other place in the world. Spatial distance is now only to a small extent a selection criterion in the search for cooperation partners.\n"

While a humanities scholar can in many cases (but not all) do his or her work in the library of another university (and, as a consequence of the [[digitisation]] of texts, perhaps in any other place in the future), a much more restrictive location constraint arises for the natural and technical scientist in the form of attachment to \"his or her\" laboratory. One can easily see this in the fact that the \"Centres of Advanced Studies\" that are emerging worldwide are predominantly institutions of the humanities and social sciences, because only in these disciplines are the necessary mobilities possible."
