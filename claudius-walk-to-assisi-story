As we walked we could reflect and then process those revelations in evocative cleansing practices. \n\nOne member of our team, somewhat older than the rest, was particularly challenged. He was in poor physical shape, struggling to keep up. He was the one invited to set the pace - the slowest then set the pace. Soon others offered to take his backpack - to lighten his way - either sharing the load by carrying it on a stick between them, and in difficult parts of the mountains, one man carrying it in on his chest, with his personal backpack on the back. \n\nSoon however, notwithstanding his condition, his courage and determination became apparent. Our awareness and frustration with his lack of strength of body was replaced with a new appreciation of his strength of character. Vulnerability now became a sign of strength, not of weakness. \n   \nI saw some of my fellow men weeping in the unburdening processes - as old hurts and wounds were surfaced and released. And I too wept with some. I also saw deep relief as permission was given to let go of emotional and psychological elements which no longer served.  And so the authenticity of our life stories deepened. \n\nAnd then we were invited and guided in reflecting on our practices, our standards, our life agreements, our unique gifts, and our dreams. We were guided in a process to meet a metaphoric ‘higher self’ - a potential ‘future becoming’, and to take counsel from that future. We were encouraged to articulate a life slogan. My future self was named ‘Ashrah’ - and my slogan was ‘Bringer of Light’. \n\nAnd we were invited to rearticulate a personal vision - and the causes we would serve to achieve it.  And so our stories now added the future to our past narrative - like the walk, the present moment became an ongoing further step in our process of becoming\n\nAnd all this deep work was done in close collaboration with our fellow pilgrims - with intimate sharing and deep listening - and personal bonding - it provided a safe and sacred context for my personal opening. \n\nA joy in masculine friendship emerged - a boyish playfulness was shared - in a drenching thunderstorm splashing happily in the puddles. After a long and tiring walk arriving in a village and having a flat-out sprint uphill, backpack and all, with a man much younger. Inhibitions were cast off and we could confidently share our deepest aspiration and dreams - unabashedly offering what to us sounded, in the moment, like poetic ‘profundities’.\n\nYet in that deeper sharing further clarification of our personal truths and aspirations could emerge - shared purpose could be recognised - a Holy Communion of noble intention. \n\nThrough presence with ourselves on the walk, through communion with each other in growing relationship, through truth-telling; deep-seated anguish was transmuted to radiance, and prejudice was transmuted to compassion. What I personally experienced and perceived in my fellow men was a new vitality - bright shining eyes, genuine laughter - a rediscovered delight in being - and the accessing of a deeper shared wisdom.\n\nTonight I awoke with the realisation that, contrary to the game we, I, play; “Who we are at essence’ is ‘truth’ - the ‘I Am’ is the way life actually works in the cosmos.”  \n\nWe took that photograph as we arrived at the entrance to Assisi. For all to be included, so that ‘...no man is left behind’, a motorist was flagged down to take the picture. In his typical gesture to those who crossed our path in a helpful way, Sujith thanked him and offered to say a prayer in the church of St Francis on his behalf. Our ersatz photographer, however, observed: “But you have a beard like the Taliban.”\n\nAnd then finally we were invited to walk bare-footed into Assisi. Me in short-pants, bare-footed, and with drying clothes dangling from my backpack, with the walking stick I had picked up and stripped with a pocket knife en route, feeling something particularly special - recognised and respected at another fundamental level. \nI returned home reassured that underlying our individual and collective human struggle is a beautiful being waiting to be liberated - as Paul wrote to the Romans: “For we know that the whole creation groans and labours with birth pangs together until now.”\n\nAnd, if the following social media communication is anything to go by, the feeling of friendship has lasted, and families have been brought into the atmosphere of respect, understanding, intimacy, and yes, into our spiritual brotherhood. ‘Fraternite’ has been re-established with ‘liberte’ and ‘egalite’.  \n\nClaudius van Wyk    \n\n\n\n \n"
