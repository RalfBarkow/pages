His funeral was on 17 Nov 2022, and we held an very caring celebration of his life on 19 Nov 2022 at SRI, for friends, colleagues, and Drew's sisters and their spouses.  Drew was beloved by many of us.  He made many important contributions to computer science and system trustworthiness&#8212;and to our lives&#8212;and will really be missed."
