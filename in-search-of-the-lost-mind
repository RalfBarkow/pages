Putin thus has a strong motive to keep the situation open and prolong the war in reliance on Russia's military might.\nOn the Ukrainian side, the attitude toward a short-term cease-fire changes almost daily. At times, President Volodymyr Selenskyj signals a willingness to renounce NATO membership and negotiate Ukraine's neutrality. The next day, he accuses Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy of having prevented Ukraine from joining NATO in 2008 and of therefore being complicit in Russian aggression. He thus expresses that Ukraine's goal, at least in the long term, remains to become a member of the military alliance in order to assume the role of an outpost against Russia there."

He blames leading politicians of the SPD, CDU and FDP, while the Greens have so far been spared his attacks, although they were closely associated with the peace movement, which was so damaging from the Ukrainian point of view."

Is it because of [[Ralf Fücks]], a veteran Green Party functionary who advocates a military solution to the conflict in a guest article for the FAZ? Fücks had recently traveled to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. From there, he brought back the message that Ukraine was not ready for a ceasefire; too much blood had already been spilled for that. \"And they (the Ukrainians, editor's note) dare to win this war if the West supports them unconditionally.\" Fücks believes that in the Chancellor's Office, \"the fear of a military escalation dominates. Yet all experience shows that Russia can only be deterred by a policy of strength.\"\nThe politician, who was already zealous against Russia in his Maoist youth, is not representative of the Greens with his attitude, as of now, but he is representative of a number of members of the former KBW (Communist League of West Germany) who joined the Greens without distinguishing themselves by any particular love of nature. Nowadays they are courted by Nato hawks; by the way, critics of the KBW expected this already 40 years ago."

For a military victory, it needs more support, much more money, and \"weapons, weapons, weapons,\" as Ukrainian Foreign Minister [[Dmytro Kuleba]] recently put it in Brussels.

We did not want it, the West can then say, Putin was to blame! True, but that the outcome was not foreseeable can hardly be said. Anyone who wants to interrupt this slow but steady escalation so far would not only have to sanction Russia, but also stop turning Ukraine from a granary into an armory. It needs a clear signal that a third world war is not an option. As usual, a reduction in payments is most likely to be understood. Those who want peace must not pay for war."

Pamphlets have emerged from Russian propaganda that can only be described as fascist. A recent guest editorial in the largest state news agency, RIA Novosti, called for the [[\"denazification\" of Ukraine]] to mean \"de-Ukrainization\" as well, and for the population to be punished and ideologically re-educated. Nationalist extremists such as Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov are opposed to negotiating with the Ukrainian government at all: They say that what has been started must be finished. Numerous eyewitnesses from the occupied territories report on murders of civilians committed by Russian soldiers; Kadyrov's soldiers were also on the scene. The Russian army denies having committed such offenses. If it were serious, it would have to launch an investigation into the allegations made and separate itself from war criminals whose murderous activities it is not happy to claim for the first time."

The only thing that counts is being on the right side."

We did not want it, the West can then say, Putin was to blame! True, but that the outcome was not foreseeable can hardly be said. Anyone who wants to interrupt this slow but steady escalation so far would not only have to sanction Russia, but also stop turning Ukraine from a granary into an armory. It needs a clear signal that a third world war is not an option. As usual, a reduction in payments is most likely to be understood. Those who want peace must not pay for war."
