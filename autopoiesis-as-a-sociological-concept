The sociologist sees through the pinnacle, he sees the holes between the jags, and they point downwards. This is how the sociologist's typical tendency to look downward, to oppositionalism, to a critique of alienation pursued with alienation zeal, comes about. What good would it do if one could now also find and climb the stairs to examine the pinnacle from close up? The distant view allows weak conceptual precision and (in a positive sense) \"speculation\". One can work with \"incongruent perspectives\" (Kenneth Burke), cherish generalized motives (*Motivverdacht*), drive ideology critique, make latent structures and functions visible, in short: claim to see through the conditions. One might then hope for empirical research. Another way (which neither rejects nor excludes empirical research) is to increase the demand for conceptual resolution and theoretical precision.\n"

Today it is at the center of a logical, cybernetic and epistemological discussion and begins to affect various empirical disciplines. If one pays attention to the extent and radicalness of the theoretical rearrangements, one cannot help but suspect a \"paradigm shift.\" But it is not a scientific \"revolution\", if this means that a novel basic insight suddenly, i.e. quickly, takes hold. On the contrary: The development of my own thinking as well as the observation of the theory discussion on a general and on a sociological level show me again and again that the innovation lying in the principle of self-reference can be formulated easily, elegantly and equipped with beautiful paradoxes, but that the thinking through of the consequences needs time and will probably still cause some surprises.\n"

Of course, every transcendental-theoretical position; because in relation to it one has to ask whether the distinction between transcendental and empirical is itself transcendental or empirical, which in both cases leads into a paradox. Furthermore, also the idea that man is – be it as body, be it as person – an observation-independent given entity. And finally, for sociology probably most painful, every categorial (that is: starting at the primary decomposition of being) use of the concept of action, which according to the usual understanding inevitably refers to a meaning-giving subject.\n"

In part, it does not make the slightest difficulty in overcoming the objections of critics. This is true, for example, of the problem of collective learning, for it is precisely the concept of autopoiesis that dynamizes the structural problem as no stock theory has done before. It is also not difficult to distinguish between a formal and an emphatic concept of meaning (linguistically, for example, sinn- haft/sinnvoll or, with Alois Hahn, Sinn-Sein/Sinn-Haben), although the emphatic concept of meaning, because it allows for negation, must then be used system-relatively. However, it is hardly worthwhile to present such \"refutations\" in detail here. The difficulties for the continuation of the discussion lie rather in the fact that the theory of self-referential systems for its part struggles with unsolved or only unclearly formulable problems and that here lie reasons for the fact that its answers turn out unsatisfactory, unclear and often too abstract.\n"

Another offer attractive for action theorists would be: to assume a surplus of possibilities of linking actions and thus of possibilities of interaction. Thus, there is no lack of possibilities, but it is unmistakable that their articulation requires further theoretical steps, must be justified by connectivity, and cannot be deduced from the evolutionary paradox.\n\n\n"

The theory of autopoietic systems leads inevitably to epistemological positions, which are discussed today under the title \"[[constructivism]]\" [⇒[[Constructivism (Konstruktivismus)]]]. This certainly does not mean a return to solipsistic or idealistic epistemologies, since a difference between system and environment is always assumed. Also, the concept of [[cognition]] is greatly expanded compared to the classical true/false coding. It can best be explained by a definitional series observation – description – cognition. [[Observation]] is the use of a [[Distinction]] to denote one side (i.e.: not the other). [[Description]] is the making of a \"text\" (an artifact, a \"script\" etc.) based on observations."

Thus, the claim for a new kind of empirical epistemology can be made, which starts from difference (not from unity) and aims at difference (not at unity), i.e. deals with the generation of differences by differences. So far, so good. But the level of articulation of this theory is nowhere near the level of elaboration of classical epistemologies (such as those of transcendental provenance), and when one asks about the construction of constructivism, instead of an answer, often only stories and examples are told. Almost all points discussed in the following are related to this deficit, although they are also directly relevant to theory independently of epistemological questions."

Instead, the theory of self-referential systems (and in this it is related to other concepts of \"proceduralization\") offers the idea of recursivity. Operations are applied to the results of operations, and with sufficiently long repetition will then, one supposes, filter out the form that can be stable under these conditions. Theory gives no guarantee that any system can evolve such forms. Ultimately, evolution will take care of the selection."

One profits thereby from the above mentioned extension of the concept of cognition. The principle is generalized to the assumption that every system controls its reality assumptions in this sense recursively by observation of its observations (second order observation, second order cybernetics). But how? With the same distinction or with varied distinctions, and if the latter: how are possibilities of variation limited? Moreover, there is still a lack of research that tries out how far one can get with this principle of recursivity if one transfers it to the area of meaningfully operating conscious or social systems. Thus, one can only assume that reality is constantly tested also by recursivity of mental and communicative operations, and this with success, because the environment of the systems is unknown and remains unknown, but in any case shows non-random, discontinuous distributions."

        "text": "It is neither about an analogy, because the concept of autopoiesis bursts the ontological tradition of thought, which alone could carry such an analogy; it gives up, radically and carried through to physics, this assumption of a world being, which connects being and thinking, and it leaves the logical tradition, which in relation to given being only allowed right and wrong judgments to the exclusion of third possibilities. It is still about a merely metaphorical use of language, that is: about a merely linguistic emergency solution. If it is to be a scientific theory, then it must be asserted that the facts are as the theory describes them, even if it is immediately conceded that this assertion is only a scientific (and not, for example, an economic, political, legal, health-promoting) assertion. But this already puts us in the middle of the problems.\n\n\n"

So far, so good. But the level of articulation of this theory is nowhere near the level of elaboration of classical epistemologies (such as those of transcendental provenance), and when one asks about the construction of constructivism, instead of an answer, often only stories and examples are told. Almost all points discussed in the following are related to this deficit, although they are also directly relevant to theory independently of epistemological questions."
