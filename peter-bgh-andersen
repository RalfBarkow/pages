His infectious commitment and professional curiosity have lured many colleagues, younger and older, onto new professional galleys. More often than not, the new projects reached port after an instructive, stimulating voyage. Many colleagues owe him a debt of gratitude for his influence and inspiration in defining their own positions. Danish humanities research has lost one of the great, pioneering innovators of recent decades. \n"
