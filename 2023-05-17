Thus the Council of the Federation, the second chamber of the Russian parliament alongside the Duma, and the most important instrument of the horizontal separation of powers, was stripped of its power. In addition to negotiating the budget and appointing judges to the Supreme Court, the Council's role primarily included the possibility of overriding the president's veto of legislative decisions by the Duma. Thus, it was the most important control organ of presidential power. Today, the Council, once conceived as a regional interest group, has become little more than a forum for business lobbyists, where clientelism, corruption, and nepotism reign. Seats on the Council are \"expensively purchased at informal auctions\" and filled by delegates who \"often have little to nothing to do with the provinces they nominally represent.\" \"The Council of the Federation\" has become a >controlled institution< par excellence in Putin's managed democracy.\""

This also reflects the specific form of rivalry between the various power groups in the Russian Federation, a constellation in which Putin seems in many respects to be the only integrative component. Not only in view of the dependence on the price of oil and a possible expansion of the economic crisis, however, there is always the danger that, with an escalation of social conflicts, the inherent logic of the racket society of \"peacemaking \" of the one chosen enemy, i.e., that definition of the enemy with which Carl Schmitt associates the possibility of forcing a \"pacified [...] organized political unity \"107 , will come to fruition unchecked, and which in the final analysis will lead to a logic of annihilation.\n"

Today, the Council, once conceived as a regional interest group, has become little more than a forum for business lobbyists,40 where clientelism, corruption, and nepotism reign.41 Seats on the Council are \"expensively purchased at informal auctions\" and filled by delegates who \"often have little to nothing to do with the provinces they nominally represent. \"42 \"The Council of the Federation\" has become a >controlled institution< par excellence in Putin's managed democracy.\""
