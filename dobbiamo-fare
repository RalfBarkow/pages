It was a devastating decline for a sportsman and journalist. In life Dad was a gentleman and a gentle man. He shied away from risk, conservative with decisions that may have an impact on his family. This is a honorable position to hold, but at times this apparent lack of courage frustrated me."

Towards the end of his life I sensed he felt his dreams were not realised and his aspirations not met. I wonder what his other contributions might have been had he been more self-confident, more [[Bold in Action]]."

It was a right of passage even though I was 36 years old. What I took away from it was an important acknowledgment he admired that decision, and perhaps even envied it. With young boys preschool age I had resigned from the principalship to pursue a passion - photography."
