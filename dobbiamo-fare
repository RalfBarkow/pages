      "text": "My Dad passed away recently. He slowly declined over years with the cruel theft Parkinson's Disease inflicts on the body. It was a devastating decline for a sportsman and journalist. In life Dad was a gentleman and a gentle man. To a large extent he was risk adverse, conservative with decisions that may have an impact on his family. However, I felt he thought his dreams were not realised and his aspirations not met. I wonder what his other contributions might have been had he more confidence."

These trips covered large distances. Australia is a sparse continent. The annual road trips were treasured by my brother and me as each offered opportunity to be with with Dad more than when he was shift working. We would pass Australian tourism icons like the Big Pineapple, Big Mango, Big Banana... The Super Strawberry. The conversation went to 'one day'. One day we would open the family 'Big Something'. We were in the car together with big dreams. As I got older the realization came that this promise for a family business working along side him would not eventuate."

More poignantly these conclusions became a mirror for my own life as I realized a  similar pattern of lacking confidence. Dreams, aspirations, goals, can only be achieved if there is courage to take action. You have to have the courage to DO!"

        "text": "My Dad passed away recently. He slowly declined over years with the cruel theft Parkinson's Disease inflicts on the body. It was a devastating decline for a sportsman and journalist. In life Dad was a gentleman and a gentle man. To a large extent he was risk adverse, conservative with decisions that may have an impact on his family. However, I felt he thought his dreams were not realised and his aspirations not met. I wonder what his other contributions might have been had he more confidence."
