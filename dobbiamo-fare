      "text": "My Dad passed away recently. He slowly declined over a few short years with the cruel theft Parkinson's Disease inflicts on the body and mind. It was a devastating decline for a sportsman and journalist. In life Dad was a gentleman and a gentle man. He shied away from risk, conservative with decisions that may have an impact on his family. This is a honorable position to hold, but at times this apparent lack of courage frustrated me."

Towards the end of his life I sensed he felt his dreams were not realised and his aspirations not met. I wonder what his other contributions might have been had he been more self-confident, more [[Bold in Action]]."

He and his best mate joked about being Dad being ‘Walter Mitty’, that fictional character who spent his time daydreaming amazing adventures. He was more out of place in the industrial world than I understood. Dad had told me ‘fell into’ the job as a cadet journalist when other options seemed too out of reach.  At the time the archetype journalist was the confident, smoking & drinking alfa male reporter. I don’t believe he had been designed for the role."

In one brief moment with Dad he validated a big decision I had made – it was a right of passage even though I was 36 years old. What I took away from this experience was an important to me acknowledgment he admired that decision, and perhaps even envied it. With young boys preschool age I had resigned from the principalship to pursue a passion: photography."

I had taken 'one day' to 'doing' and in showing that courage to walk into my creative self, earned his blessing. "

Whilst completing a postgraduate degree investigating the [[Knowing Doing Gap]], I discovered a quote from Leonardo da Vinci that expresses this sentiment best.

Towards the end of his life I sensed he felt his dreams were not realised and his aspirations not met. I wonder what his other contributions might have been had he been more self-confident, more [[Bold in Action]]."

He and his best mate joked about being Dad being ‘Walter Mitty’, that fictional character who spent his time daydreaming amazing adventures. He was more out of place in the industrial world than I understood. Dad had told me ‘fell into’ the job as a cadet journalist when other options seemed too out of reach.  At the time the archetype journalist was the confident, smoking & drinking alfa male reporter. I don’t believe he had been designed for the role."

In one brief moment with Dad he validated a big decision I had made – it was a right of passage even though I was 36 years old. What I took away from this experience was an important to me acknowledgment he admired that decision, and perhaps even envied it. With young boys preschool age I had resigned from the principalship to pursue a passion: photography."

He spoken quietly and simply said, “I think you are doing the right thing,” leaving me with a tear in my eye. I had taken 'one day' to 'doing' and in showing that courage to walk into my creative self, earned his blessing. "

'Sono stato impressionato dall'urgenza di fare. Conoscere non e sufficiente; dobbiamo applicare. Essere disposti non e sufficiente; dobbiamo fare.'"
