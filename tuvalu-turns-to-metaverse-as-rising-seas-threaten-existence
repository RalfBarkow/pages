Tuvalu foreign minister Simon Kofe told the COP27 climate summit, &quot;Our land, our ocean, our culture are the most precious assets of our people and to keep them safe from harm, no matter what happens in the physical world, we will move them to the cloud.&quot; Kofe hopes the digital version of Tuvalu will allow the country to continue as a state, even if the ocean covers it completely. He said seven governments have agreed to continue recognizing Tuvalu even if it is covered in water, adding that its submersion would be challenging from the standpoint of international law."
