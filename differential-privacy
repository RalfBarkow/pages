The paper presents a technique for protecting the privacy of individuals whose data is used to train a machine learning model. The technique is based on the idea of adding noise to the data in a way that is proportional to the \"sensitivity\" of the query being made. The sensitivity of a query is a measure of how much the query's output would change if the input data were slightly different.\n\nThe authors propose a framework for determining the appropriate amount of noise to add to the data based on the sensitivity of the query. They show that this technique can be used to provide \"differential privacy\" for the individuals whose data is being used, while still allowing the machine learning model to be trained on the data.\n\nIn summary, the paper presents a technique for preserving the privacy of individuals whose data is used to train a machine learning model by adding noise to the data in a way that is proportional to the sensitivity of the query being made, providing a framework for determining the appropriate amount of noise to add to the data and showing that this technique can be used to provide \"differential privacy\" for the individuals whose data is being used, while still allowing the machine learning model to be trained on the data."

The paper introduces a new measure of privacy loss called \"[[Sensitivity]]\" which is defined as the maximum amount of change in the output of a query function when a single individual's data is included or excluded from the dataset. They propose to add noise to the query function's output to protect privacy, and the amount of noise added is calibrated to the sensitivity of the query function to protect the privacy of individuals. The paper also presents a mathematical proof of the privacy guarantees provided by this method, and it provides a formal definition of differential privacy. They also discuss how to balance privacy and utility by choosing the appropriate level of noise to add to the query function's output."

        "text": "The paper \"Calibrating Noise to Sensitivity in Private Data Analysis\" by Dwork, McSherry, Nissim and Smith defines privacy, or differential privacy, as a measure of the amount of information revealed about a single individual in a dataset when that individual's data is included or excluded from the dataset. The paper introduces a new measure of privacy loss called \"sensitivity\" which is defined as the maximum amount of change in the output of a query function when a single individual's data is included or excluded from the dataset. They propose to add noise to the query function's output to protect privacy, and the amount of noise added is calibrated to the sensitivity of the query function to protect the privacy of individuals. The paper also presents a mathematical proof of the privacy guarantees provided by this method, and it provides a formal definition of differential privacy. They also discuss how to balance privacy and utility by choosing the appropriate level of noise to add to the query function's output."
