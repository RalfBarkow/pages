This created a circumstance where the overwhelming majority of programming was aimed to appeal to the common denominators linking broad demographics.

Matrix is a rare case of one that got into mainstream, but it only did because it had action. A lot of people I talked to didn't like that there was so much philosophy in them. I explained all the philosophy behind the movies, and the layers within layers of layers about who Neo was, what he was doing, why he died. and then these kids go to me, \"why did they make it so complicated, it's just a movie?\".
