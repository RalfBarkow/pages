        "text": "Physicists have continued their discoveries, leading to the formulation of a quantum field theory that underlies a new understanding of the nature of matter – one that recognized that it is fields from which matter emerges, not from particles. Particles are, indeed just moments of excited quanta, much like photons that are packets of energy on the wavelength of light.
