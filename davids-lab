In addition to numerous drawings, samples, and diagrams of various neomorphs and xenomorph-like lifeforms, one of the crewmembers discovers an egg that remains intact. The researcher scans the egg, but as the analysis continues the xenomorph egg begins to show signs of life, eventually opening as the researcher attempts to collect data from it. Finally, a facehugger emerges and attacks the lone investigator. As Ridley Scott has expressed an interest in adding to his Alien universe, there will likely be more reveals like these to come."
