I am also a bookseller and web designer, and have long worked as a computer salesman. I have written a social philosophy book on the language of technical intelligence and the novel Walden III, I have taught sociology, ethics, technology assessment, infomation management, and systems theory as an adjunct professor at various universities. I facilitated systemic learning events at the Fachstelle für Weiterbildung of the University of Zurich and managed knowledge in the EU-Esprit project Knowledge Management With Intranet Technologies. Currently I have a teaching position in 2nd order systems theory at the Department of Psychology at the University of Zurich. I am autodidactically on the path of hypercommunication as a scribbler. I understand this path as zen-practise in a master art, which I explore under the viewpoints of the Radical Constructivists. In doing so, I am writing on my hyper-library on the internet. I have been facilitating events for dialogue since 1999. I do organizational and communication coaching for companies and institutions - and especially dialogue seminars.\n\n"
