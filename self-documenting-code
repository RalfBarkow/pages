If you think documentation and code are hard to keep in sync, how much harder is it for developers to make their code and unit tests express everything meaningful about a system?

For everyone coming after you what the code does is almost less important than what it is supposed to do and why you chose to do in such a way. What tradeoffs were involved in your system? Why didn't you do it another way? What feature are you implementing that is not obvious from the code? Are you using a uint32 for the wrap around characteristics? Without a comment how will i know this? How will i know the consideration of wrap around is even important? What will happen if wrap around isn't handled correctly? Is this uint32 to int conversion correct? Why do you think it is? These are the simplest of examples, but it happens all the time at every level.
