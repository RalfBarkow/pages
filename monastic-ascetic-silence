This coding, like any coding, when applied to itself, becomes paradoxical. The schema itself is immanently constituted. The unity of difference is found in the left side of the code. The duplication of the world produced by the code always runs back into immanence, moreover – and this seems very important – into the side of the code that opposes the preference gradient towards transcendence. Codes always have a side that is preferred: One would rather be right than wrong, rather have than not have, rather truth than untruth, rather be together with the beloved against the world than without him in the world. >> immanence transcendence paradox gradient"

The effect is the negative occupation of immanent world, which, no matter how much one may pedal, holds in itself every communication related to transcendence, every thought related to transcendence. Structures and processes oriented toward transcending immanence are immanent structures and processes, in the case of transcendence-related communication devastatingly this-worldly social systems. Religion systems form, one could say, behind the back of transcendence-related communication. The non-preferential world is continually produced, and in this sense the paradox of the unity of the immanence/transcendent schema [Immanenz/Transparenz; sic!] is catalytic, and in this sense it produces the typically Christian [[Suffering]] from the world. One can make this paradoxical figure sensuously tangible by means of the stagyriths, the column saints, who – ascending into the vertical – seek to escape what they – fleeing – produce themselves: the abstruse, the inescapably consistent hirsuteness of the column. >> religion paradox unity immanence transcendence transparency suffering"

It inevitably produces what it wants to avoid; it repels itself from immanence and produces it just with it. The direction towards transcendence is in one go a way from the world and the production of what is fled from. This can be read as the impossible possibility of Christian existence and from it - under dramatophilic conditions - psychic profit of its own kind."

Christianity, insofar as it is a system and makes use of the code immanence/transcendence (or its [[Preadaptive Advances]]), generates apotaxies for itself, which in turn turn into world, and it therefore seems to be no coincidence that the flight from the world of early Christianity generates exactly those structures and processes which we are used to call sect, monasticism or orders. That then, as one can anticipate, the paradoxes accompanying these movements reappear in their own context of invisibilization leads to our actual object: the monastic-ascetic silence. >> preadaptive advance"

        "text": "In the case of religion, this asymmetry becomes dramatic because whenever you want transcendence, you get what you don't want: Immanence. The effect is the negative occupation of immanent world, which, no matter how much one may pedal, holds in itself every communication related to transcendence, every thought related to transcendence. Structures and processes oriented toward transcending immanence are immanent structures and processes, in the case of transcendence-related communication devastatingly this-worldly social systems. Religion systems form, one could say, behind the back of transcendence-related communication. The non-preferential world is continually produced, and in this sense the paradox of the unity of the immanence/transcendent schema [Immanenz/Transparenz; sic!] is catalytic, and in this sense it produces the typically Christian [[Suffering]] from the world. One can make this paradoxical figure sensuously tangible by means of the stagyriths, the column saints, who – ascending into the vertical – seek to escape what they – fleeing – produce themselves: the abstruse, the inescapably consistent hirsuteness of the column. >> religion paradox unity immanence transcendence transparency suffering"
