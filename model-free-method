        "text": "In particular, in Paper III, by extending an open source economic simulation framework, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) was used to optimise a dynamic price policy for trading the locally produced electricity. Compared with a benchmark fixed price signal, the dynamic price mechanism arrived at by RL, increased community net profit by more than 28%, and median community self-sufficiency by more than 2%. Furthermore, emergent social-economic behaviours such as changes in supply w.r.t changes in price were identified. A limitation of Paper III, however, is that it was conducted in a single environment. To address this limitation and to assess the general validity of the proposed MARL-solution, in Paper IV a full factorial experiment based on the factors of climate - manifested in heterogeneous demand/supply profiles and associated battery parameters, community scale, and price mechanism, was conducted in order to ascertain the response of the community w.r.t net-loss (financial gain), self-sufficiency, and income equality from trading locally produced electricity."
