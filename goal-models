Such models extend traditional AI planning techniques for representing goals by allowing for partially defined and possibly inconsistent goals. This paper presents a formal framework for reasoning with such goal models. In particular, the paper proposes a qualitative and a numerical axiomatization for goal modeling primitives and introduces [[label propagation]] algorithms that are shown to be sound and complete with respect to their respective axiomatizations. In addition, the paper reports on experimental results on the propagation algorithms applied to a goal model for a US car manufacturer.\n"
