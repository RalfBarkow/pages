Why could one not implement recent changes as kind of an automatic blog, and then have authors come in an post blog entries temporally between (or around) actual changes in the wiki. This way, you are taking advantage of an already time-dependant feature of wiki to sort of narrate the wiki itself, and maybe other related things. This does of course conflict with the [[Wiki Nature]], since in order for it to be accurately temporal, no one should beable to go back and edit time dependant content. Though in small groups (of possibly one) i think it has potential for success. And I personally would be very interested in such software. -- [[Jesse Rudolph]]",

[[Snip Snap]] relies heavily on 'comments', which is basically what thread mode looks like in Wiki, except that it is next to impossible to edit comments in [[Snip Snap]]. This leads to [[Thread Mess]] and the related problems of such forums. Also, it is too easy to just put all your relevant thoughts into timestamped blogs with titles like '2003_10_01-1'. This is next to useless for wiki. It takes discipline to move important info into a separate wiki page, and so it is too rarely done in practice. ",

Why could one not implement recent changes as kind of an automatic blog, and then have authors come in an post blog entries temporally between (or around) actual changes in the wiki. This way, you are taking advantage of an already time-dependant feature of wiki to sort of narrate the wiki itself, and maybe other related things. This does of course conflict with the [[Wiki Nature]], since in order for it to be accurately temporal, no one should beable to go back and edit time dependant content. Though in small groups (of possibly one) i think it has potential for success. And I personally would be very interested in such software. -- [[Jesse Rudolph]]",
