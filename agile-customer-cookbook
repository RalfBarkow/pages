[[Ole Jepsen]]: In my experience, most business project managers usually turn out to play the role of the business expert. They are often picked to participate in the project because of their business knowledge (as opposed to their leadership skills). The IT-project manager is often more experienced as a project manager than the business project manager - so no matter how the \"project organization\" is defined - usually the IT project manager takes over the PM-responsibilities in the project. This leaves us with a business sponsor and a business expert... Often the business sponsor is the one that understand, that \"business value\" can be created in many ways - and that a close and flexible collaboration amongst business and IT within the project group is most likely to give most business value. But where does that leave the business expert? In my experience the general picture is, that most business experts has more to learn from Agile than business sponsor. This is because the business expert is (and should be) more into the details. And when you know exactly what you want in details - then you tend to be more \"closed\", which is not a good state of mind in an Agile project...",
