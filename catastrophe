All these are symptoms of the present crisis. All designing (also that of children) must start from this crisis. It must recompute the calculated into alternative concreteness.

All these are symptoms of the present crisis. All designing (also that of children) must start from this crisis. It must recompute the calculated into alternative concreteness. What comes out of it, if it succeeds, can hardly be distinguished from the lost \"primitive\". A densely enough scattered hologram of a table, for example, would be, if it succeeded, indistinguishable from a \"perceived given\" table."
