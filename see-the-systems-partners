Again, like Map the System, it is a competition based on analysis: In this case computer modelling analysis.\n- There was a competition based on a cybernetic simulation game called Ecopolicy which engaged teams of high school students in Australia and Vietnam ([https://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/5/2/239/htm Access paper published 2014 here]).

In this chart, the horizontal X axis is time and the vertical Y axis is an accumulation. The graph illustrates how exponential growth (green) eventually surpasses both linear (red) and cubic (blue) growth. However, at first this is not apparent."
