I learn this about the art market analyst after meeting with him to talk about his career, and by extension, everyone\nelse’s: “I like to be able to call the artist up and ask them what’s going on when I’m looking at something. Like why is that shaped like a door?” Magnus tells me that, during lockdown, he probably bought around twenty works of art, much of it directly off Instagram. It turns out we each purchased pieces through “[[Pictures for Elmhurst]]”, a hospital benefit. This isn’t the only thing we have in common: we only got to the Holy Land (what Magnus unironically calls the New York City art world) because we happened to party at the right art schools. We’ve each failed a start-up (maybe twice if we liked it) and we’re both alive at the same time. When I say the name “[[Oto Gillen]]”, the Düsseldorf-born datalord makes a note of the epic photographer immediately. We call this networking."

If it did, he’d be a proper intellectual. This man is, by contrast, a figure of what sociologist Alvin Gouldner would classify as intelligentsia pura. Magnus is cool and sleek like cultural commerce, the kind of guy who could translate anything regardless of what’s been\neffaced. He is eager to talk about his latest book,\n[[How to Become a Successful Artist (2021)]]. In it, he breaks down the 63.4-billion-dollar art economy\ninto the smooth severablilities of the [[contemporary art]] racket: pie charts, infographics, case studies, contracts. The book targets the emerging artist crowd and asks those burning questions that no graduate department will: How do I secure gallery representation? How do I compose an artist statement? How should I price my artworks? What’s the best Instagram strategy? Capital, power, labour: it’s all here, and accessible like never before."

Resch’s “Quantifying Success and Reputation in Art” was a landmark in network science. It was also something of a coup. The 2018 whitepaper, published in Science, makes the claim that art has nothing to do with history, just as value has nothing to do with money. Success in art isn’t even about aesthetics. Art, the paper argues, is but a network effect. Maybe it’s patriarchy, maybe it’s privilege: the paper demonstrates that the value of a work of art is determined entirely by its context, and because art has no usevalue, its value is quantifiable only in terms of the market-institutional feedback loops between a small\ngroup of major institutions and the slightly less-small pool of artists they trade on. Surplus value, like privilege, is apparently a prerequisite: “Recognition”, the paper claims, is “external from the work itself.”"

(A friend of mine, a dealer, divulges that couples who cultivate art collections rarely divorce.) Should one wish to interrupt these peacocking displays for any reason, including opportunity, How to Become a Successful Artist advises hitting up Stefan Simchowitz via Instagram. I have heard rumours that, much like the actual Satan, the so-called “patron Satan” of the art world will respond to DMs should you repeat his name three\ntimes backwards and demonstrate some visual\npotential. Obviously, this is not recommended,\nand you will lose followers if not friends: Sim is a\n“poacher”, an “outsider”, he’s “Hollywood.” Yet one\ncould argue that his unconventional strategies –\nlike selling work directly out of a studio, “accelerating” younger artists, is the studio art equivalent of a tech incubator, selling with the intent to flip, etc. – disrupt the initiation rites that validate one buyer, or one kind of buying, over another.

I learn this about the art market analyst after meeting with him to talk about his career, and by extension, everyone\nelse’s: “I like to be able to call the artist up and ask them what’s going on when I’m looking at something. Like why is that shaped like a door?” Magnus tells me that, during lockdown, he probably bought around twenty works of art, much of it directly off Instagram. It turns out we each purchased pieces through “[[Pictures for Elmhurst]]”, a hospital benefit. This isn’t the only thing we have in common: we only got to the Holy Land (what Magnus unironically calls the New York City art world) because we happened to party at the right art schools. We’ve each failed a start-up (maybe twice if we liked it) and we’re both alive at the same time. When I say the name “[[Oto Gillen]]”, the Düsseldorf-born datalord makes a note of the epic photographer immediately. We call this networking."

Resch’s “Quantifying Success and Reputation in Art” was a landmark in network science. It was also something of a coup. The 2018 whitepaper, published in Science, makes the claim that art has nothing to do with history, just as value has nothing to do with money. Success in art isn’t even about aesthetics. Art, the paper argues, is but a network effect. Maybe it’s patriarchy, maybe it’s privilege: the paper demonstrates that the value of a work of art is determined entirely by its context, and because art has no usevalue, its value is quantifiable only in terms of the market-institutional feedback loops between a small\ngroup of major institutions and the slightly less-small pool of artists they trade on. Surplus value, like privilege, is apparently a prerequisite: “Recognition”, the paper claims, is “external from the work itself.”"

There are just successful ones. This concept is introduced with a brief case study on [[The Man with the Golden Helmet]], an 18th-century painting thought to be a Rembrandt until the mid-1980s: “Once evidence emerged, in the 1980s, that the painting was not by Rembrandt, it lost much of its artistic and economic value, even though the artwork itself had not changed.”"

In a post-Covid, post-#MeToo art\nworld, I cannot imagine that meeting a young\nwoman in person is an easy decision to make,\nespecially when the woman in question happens\nto be a journalist. Magnus’s definition of a successful artist is thorough, wholesome: it sympathetically portrays a successful artist as one who not only makes art, but makes art work in the context of a public presence. Yet the private circumscribes the public as its limit. "

Should one wish to interrupt these peacocking displays for any reason, including opportunity, How to Become a Successful Artist advises hitting up Stefan Simchowitz via Instagram.

Obviously, this is not recommended,\nand you will lose followers if not friends: Sim is a\n“poacher”, an “outsider”, he’s “Hollywood.” Yet one\ncould argue that his unconventional strategies –\nlike selling work directly out of a studio, “accelerating” younger artists, is the studio art equivalent of a tech incubator, selling with the intent to flip, etc. – disrupt the initiation rites that validate one buyer, or one kind of buying, over another.
