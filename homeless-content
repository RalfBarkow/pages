But, it does not \"force\" one to ask for a unique combination of columns in query results, which I think is silly and obsessive. I'm okay with requiring some kind of override flag when asking for \"bags\" to serve as a warning or reminder, but am against outright forcing it. Anyhow, we already have enough topics on the \"bag debate\" such that there is no need to repeat all that here. It has the same \"bag flaw\" that SQL does and thus is no worse in that regard than SQL. The goal here is to manage GUI info with known and familiar SQL-based or SQL-like tools and conventions, NOT overhaul or replace SQL. That's a different topic and goal. \"Relational\" is the common colloquial term for SQL-RDBMS's. Whether that conflicts with the \"formal\" definition is perhaps another topic. This wiki is not obligated to avoid colloquial terms in titles. -t",
