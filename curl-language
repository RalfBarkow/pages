Today, Curl is developed by Curl Inc.

The basic language is simply embedded in text by use of curly-brace delimiters {}, thus the name 'curl'. Default primitive display elements are inspired by HTML and [[Tcl Tk]], but also include data-grids and drill-down. Curl supports defining or extending OO classes, including the default ones. ",

With Adobe's Flex/[[Action Script]], you'll do a lot of rework tweaking what executes client-side versus what executes server-side.

You'll spend time learning several different languages, and you'll write extra code to interface them. By designing away a few [[Discontinuity Spike]]s, plus providing some good default libraries, Curl app code tends to be smaller than Ajax or Flex. (OTOH, the Curl RTE plugin is bigger.) By supporting homoiconic code, extensible types, and sandboxing and JIT, Curl apps can be extended with minimal changes to existing code.",
