The program invites students to question preconceived ideas about the roles art plays in society, and to examine how these roles are impacted by specific forms and mediums. To that end, students are encouraged to experiment with artistic process, to track the way that ideas change as they move through various modes of production, and to examine how content is affected by methods of display and dissemination. via [https://www.art.ucla.edu/areas-of-study/new-genres/ UCLA]"

As an analogy, a page number in a book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page; dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page with the given page number and reading the text found on that page.
