At the core of pattern languages was Alexander's appreciation of the processes of collective unfolding of architectural space. Traditional communities were not designed by a master plan defined by an expert, but by a multiple of community members each making a series of decisions based on a shared understand of beauty, unfolding through, what was later recognized as [[Stigmergic Iteration]].\n"
