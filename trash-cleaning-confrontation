Please watch the video of the police officer's body camera as he \"investigates\" Zayd Atkinson \"for trespassing\". The systemic problems that lead to this are hard to see, 'cos they're operating in the background. Most people in this city who are cleaning up grounds around any given building are 1. a small group of people, and 2. mostly of Mexican descent. I will speculate that context contributed significantly to the officer's assumptions—which seem to be assuming that Mr. Atkinson was \"casing the joint\" rather than cleaning the grounds. If it had been me picking up around the place, the officer would likely have assumed I was an owner or landlord just picking up, 'cos I'm white and fit those assumptions."
