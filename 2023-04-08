They are best thought of as rather random evolutionary variations that have accumulated by chance and by fashion. Different countries use different methods for determining sums and products, as have different historical ages. I believe that how people added and multiplied in the 18th century could be superior to how we are taught today. For example, multiplication was done by successive doubling. Folks mastered the two-times table and that was sufficient. Two hundred years ago, the techniques of arithmetic had to be tailored to cognitive needs because folks had little skill and even less experience with arithmetic. Today’s algorithms have been distorted by the rush to symbolic approaches a century ago, embracing an abstract ideal while ignoring evolutionary precedence, native human skills, and neurological organization.

        "text": "The addition and multiplication algorithms taught in grade school are not necessarily modern, nor are they tailored for ease of learning nor for cognitive efficiency. They are best thought of as rather random evolutionary variations that have accumulated by chance and by fashion. Different countries use different methods for determining sums and products, as have different historical ages. I believe that how people added and multiplied in the 18th century could be superior to how we are taught today. For example, multiplication was done by successive doubling. Folks mastered the two-times table and that was sufficient. Two hundred years ago, the techniques of arithmetic had to be tailored to cognitive needs because folks had little skill and even less experience with arithmetic. Today’s algorithms have been distorted by the rush to symbolic approaches a century ago, embracing an abstract ideal while ignoring evolutionary precedence, native human skills, and neurological organization.
