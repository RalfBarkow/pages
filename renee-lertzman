And people who are anxious and alarmed can’t remain alarmed forever. Eventually, we overload and check out. In her TED Talk, How to Turn Climate Anxiety into Action, Renée explains that when we humans experience stress of any kind, if it becomes more than we can tolerate, we collapse. One possible outcome of this collapse is depression, despair, and shutting down.“\n\n."

A Canadian climate scientist living in Texas, she negotiates distrust of data, indifference to imminent threats, and resistance to proposed solutions with ease. Over the past fifteen years Hayhoe has found that the most important thing we can do to address climate change is talk about it-and she wants to teach you how. In Saving Us, Hayhoe argues that when it comes to changing hearts and minds, facts are only one part of the equation. We need to find shared values in order to connect our unique identities to collective action. This is not another doomsday narrative about a planet on fire. It is a multilayered look at science, faith, and human psychology, from an icon in her field-recently named chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy. Drawing on interdisciplinary research and personal stories, Hayhoe shows that small conversations can have astonishing results. Saving Us leaves us with the tools to open a dialogue with your loved ones about how we all can play a role in pushing forward for change”--\n"
