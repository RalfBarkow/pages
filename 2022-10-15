Through technology, people who master it become fabulously potent. The glory of technology fits perfectly to the glory of violence. And so the technical perfection fits to the unaffectedness of the perpetrator. It is different to strangle a man with bare hands than to hit him with an arrow. The arrows gain greater and greater ranges, some button or lever takes the place of the cocked bow. The connection of one's own action with the consequences becomes more invisible, more unintelligible. What is needed is objective concentration, emotions can only disturb.\nThe actual importance of the individual interactions I have mentioned can be assessed differently. It seems to be undoubted to me that the tendencies to violence-glorification and to indifference follow the technical development and connect with the newly reached level. The syndrome of total violence is therefore not to be understood statically, but as a progression.\nThe progression of total violence is currently taking place in the field of tension of the competition between two world powers, a competition from which neither side can get out without endangering its own existence. How inevitably the accumulation of a tremendous potential of total violence seems to continue.\nThe trains of thought I have followed so far are rather confirmed by this permanent self-exaggeration of man's power to injure. In any case, they are not suitable for reassurance before the threatening dangers. But they should be suitable for the question which counterforces are conceivable. Admittedly, we will not find the move that saves the draw. On the contrary, whoever asks the question about counterforces must be prepared for considerations that sound illusory.\n\nOf course, any arms limitation and any disarmament is\n"
