Online. 3 February 2020. arXiv. arXiv:2002.00654. Available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00654 [Accessed 2 February 2024]. \nWe give a generalization to a continuous setting of the classic Markov chain tree Theorem. In particular, we consider an irreducible diffusion process on a metric graph. The unique invariant measure has an atomic component on the vertices and an absolutely continuous part on the edges. We show that the corresponding density at $x$ can be represented by a normalized superposition of the weights associated to metric arborescences oriented toward the point $x$. The weight of each oriented metric arborescence is obtained by the exponential of integrals of the form $intfrac{b}{sigma^2}$ along the oriented edges time a weight for each node determined by the local orientation of the arborescence around the node time the inverse of the diffusion coefficient at $x$. The metric arborescences are obtained cutting the original metric graph along some edges.\narXiv:2002.00654 [math]\n\nAREFIN, Md, RAHMAN, M.

DOI 10.1126/sciadv.1500087. \nInspired by the classical phenomenon of random walk, the concept of quantum walk has emerged recently as a powerful platform for the dynamical simulation of complex quantum systems, entanglement production and universal quantum computation. Such a wide perspective motivates a renewing search for efficient, scalable and stable implementations of this quantum process. Photonic approaches have hitherto mainly focused on multi-path schemes, requiring interferometric stability and a number of optical elements that scales quadratically with the number of steps. Here we report the experimental realization of a quantum walk taking place in the orbital angular momentum space of light, both for a single photon and for two simultaneous indistinguishable photons. The whole process develops in a single light beam, with no need of interferometers, and requires optical resources scaling linearly with the number of steps. Our demonstration introduces a novel versatile photonic platform for implementing quantum simulations, based on exploiting the transverse modes of a single light beam as quantum degrees of freedom.\narXiv:1403.4857 [physics, physics:quant-ph]\n\nCARDANO, Filippo, MASSA, Francesco, QASSIM, Hammam, KARIMI, Ebrahim, SLUSSARENKO, Sergei, PAPARO, Domenico, DE LISIO, Corrado, SCIARRINO, Fabio, SANTAMATO, Enrico and BOYD, Robert W., [no date].

Hitherto, photonic implementations of quantum walks have mainly been based on multipath interferometric schemes in real space. We report the experimental realization of a discrete quantum walk taking place in the orbital angular momentum space of light, both for a single photon and for two simultaneous photons. In contrast to previous implementations, the whole process develops in a single light beam, with no need of interferometers; it requires optical resources scaling linearly with the number of steps; and it allows flexible control of input and output superposition states. Exploiting the latter property, we explored the system band structure in momentum space and the associated spin-orbit topological features by simulating the quantum dynamics of Gaussian wavepackets. Our demonstration introduces a novel versatile photonic platform for quantum simulations.\n\nCARLISLE, Jane, 1998. Lone motherhood and failed transitions: pathways to criminal careers?.. Online.

One important aspect is the relation between spatial organization and the population’s composition. Here we study a specific example -- sectors in expanding bacterial colonies. Such sectors are spatially segregated sub-populations of mutants. The sectors can be seen both in disk-shaped colonies and in branching colonies. We study the sectors using two models we have used in the past to study bacterial colonies -- a continuous reaction-diffusion model with non-linear diffusion and a discrete ``Communicating Walkers’’ model. We find that in expanding colonies, and especially in branching colonies, segregation processes are more likely than in a spatially static population. One such process is the establishment of stable sub- population having neutral mutation. Another example is the maintenance of wild-type population along side with sub-population of advantageous mutants. Understanding such processes in bacterial colonies is an important subject by itself, as well as a model system for similar processes in other spreading populations.\narXiv:cond-mat/9811208\n\nHALIM, Amir Haikal Abdul, SAMAH, Khyrina Airin Fariza Abu, JONO, Mohd Nor Hajar Hasrol and RIZA, Lala Septem, [no date].

We resolve the issue of numerical efficiency of customized closed‐form and recursive forward and inverse dynamics algorithms for kinematically and dynamically structured manipulators. We find that ARM‐generated customized closed‐form algorithms are the most computationally efficient calculators of forward and inverse dynamics of three degree‐of‐freedom manipulators. For six DOF predominantly rotational manipulators, ARM‐generated customized recursive algorithms are the most computationally efficient foward and inverse dynamics algorithms; inverse dynamics can be computed in less than one millisecond on commercially‐available processors (in software, without special‐purpose hardware). In our companion article,\n              4\n              we compare the symbolic efficiencies of six robot dynamics formulations for generating closed‐form and recursive models.\n\nOLLA, Piero, 2015a.

A reinforced random walk is one which changes the weight of any edge (or vertex) visited to increase the frequency of return visits. The generating function for the discrete case is first derived for the joint probability distribution of $S_N$ (the location of the walker at the $N$^{th}$ step) and $A_N$ the maximum location the walker achieved in $N$ steps. Then the bulk of the analysis concerns the statistics of the limiting Brownian walker, and of its “environment”, both parametrized by the amplitude of the reinforcement.\narXiv:1310.0301 [math]\n\nRADOR, Tonguç and TANERI, Sencer, 2006.

The foundational standards of the Web of Data include the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and the Resource Description Framework (RDF). URIs are used to identify resources and RDF is used to relate resources. While RDF has been posited as a logic language designed specifically for knowledge representation and reasoning, it is more generally useful if it can conveniently support other models of computing. In order to realize the Web of Data as a general-purpose medium for storing and processing the world’s data, it is necessary to separate RDF from its logic language legacy and frame it simply as a data model. Moreover, there is significant advantage in seeing the Semantic Web as a particular interpretation of the Web of Data that is focused specifically on knowledge representation and reasoning. By doing so, other interpretations of the Web of Data are exposed that realize RDF in different capacities and in support of different computing models.\narXiv:0905.3378 [cs]\n\nRODRIGUEZ, Marko A. and WATKINS, Jennifer H., 2010.

DOI 10.1002/adom.202001739. \nAbstract\n            Quantum topological photonics is a new research field with great potential that is based on developments in both quantum optics and topological photonics. Topological photonics offers unique properties, including topological robustness and an anti‐backscattering property, and these advantages are strongly required in quantum optics. Quantum technology, which includes quantum optics, represents an important direction for future technological development. However, existing quantum light sources are unstable and quantum information may easily be lost during transmission. These disadvantages have troubled researchers for a long time and no perfect solution is available thus far. Fortunately, application of topological photonics to quantum optics can help to generate robust quantum light sources and protect photons from decoherence during photon propagation. This allows the correlation and entanglement to be maintained even when photons travel over long distances. To date, quantum topological photonics has provided major breakthroughs in certain quantum devices. This Review presents the basic concepts of quantum topological photonics and summarizes how the topological protection property works in quantum light sources, quantum information transmission, and other quantum devices. Finally, an outlook is provided on the remaining challenges and potential future directions of quantum topological photonics, which can aid in exploration of additional new phenomena.\n\nZHANG, George, CHRISTOV, Ivan C. and RAHMAN, Aminur, 2023. Multi-bounce resonances in the interaction of walking droplets. Mechanics Research Communications. December 2023. Vol. 134, p. 104215. DOI 10.1016/j.mechrescom.2023.104215. \nDiscrete dynamical models of walking droplets (“walkers”) have allowed swift numerical experiments revealing heretofore unobserved quantum statistics and related behaviors in a classical hydrodynamic system. We present evidence that one such model of walking droplets exhibits the empirically elusive $n$-bounce resonances that are traditionally seen in the scattering of solitary waves governed by covariant nonlinear field theories with polynomial self-interaction. A numerical investigation of the chosen model of interacting walking droplets reveals a fractal structure of resonances in the velocity in--velocity out diagram, much like the usual maps constructed for collisions of solitary waves. We suggest avenues for further theoretical analysis of walker collisions, which may connect this discrete model to the field-theoretic setting, as well as directions towards new experimental realizations $n$-bounce resonances.\narXiv:2304.06001 [nlin, physics:physics]\n"

Online. 3 February 2020. arXiv. arXiv:2002.00654. Available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00654 [Accessed 2 February 2024]. \nWe give a generalization to a continuous setting of the classic Markov chain tree Theorem. In particular, we consider an irreducible diffusion process on a metric graph. The unique invariant measure has an atomic component on the vertices and an absolutely continuous part on the edges. We show that the corresponding density at $x$ can be represented by a normalized superposition of the weights associated to metric arborescences oriented toward the point $x$. The weight of each oriented metric arborescence is obtained by the exponential of integrals of the form $intfrac{b}{sigma^2}$ along the oriented edges time a weight for each node determined by the local orientation of the arborescence around the node time the inverse of the diffusion coefficient at $x$. The metric arborescences are obtained cutting the original metric graph along some edges.\narXiv:2002.00654 [math]\n\nAREFIN, Md, RAHMAN, M.

Such a wide perspective motivates a renewing search for efficient, scalable and stable implementations of this quantum process. Photonic approaches have hitherto mainly focused on multi-path schemes, requiring interferometric stability and a number of optical elements that scales quadratically with the number of steps. Here we report the experimental realization of a quantum walk taking place in the orbital angular momentum space of light, both for a single photon and for two simultaneous indistinguishable photons. The whole process develops in a single light beam, with no need of interferometers, and requires optical resources scaling linearly with the number of steps. Our demonstration introduces a novel versatile photonic platform for implementing quantum simulations, based on exploiting the transverse modes of a single light beam as quantum degrees of freedom.\narXiv:1403.4857 [physics, physics:quant-ph]\n\nCARDANO, Filippo, MASSA, Francesco, QASSIM, Hammam, KARIMI, Ebrahim, SLUSSARENKO, Sergei, PAPARO, Domenico, DE LISIO, Corrado, SCIARRINO, Fabio, SANTAMATO, Enrico and BOYD, Robert W., [no date].

Hitherto, photonic implementations of quantum walks have mainly been based on multipath interferometric schemes in real space. We report the experimental realization of a discrete quantum walk taking place in the orbital angular momentum space of light, both for a single photon and for two simultaneous photons. In contrast to previous implementations, the whole process develops in a single light beam, with no need of interferometers; it requires optical resources scaling linearly with the number of steps; and it allows flexible control of input and output superposition states. Exploiting the latter property, we explored the system band structure in momentum space and the associated spin-orbit topological features by simulating the quantum dynamics of Gaussian wavepackets. Our demonstration introduces a novel versatile photonic platform for quantum simulations.\n\nCARLISLE, Jane, 1998. Lone motherhood and failed transitions: pathways to criminal careers?.. Online.

One important aspect is the relation between spatial organization and the population’s composition. Here we study a specific example -- sectors in expanding bacterial colonies. Such sectors are spatially segregated sub-populations of mutants. The sectors can be seen both in disk-shaped colonies and in branching colonies. We study the sectors using two models we have used in the past to study bacterial colonies -- a continuous reaction-diffusion model with non-linear diffusion and a discrete ``Communicating Walkers’’ model. We find that in expanding colonies, and especially in branching colonies, segregation processes are more likely than in a spatially static population. One such process is the establishment of stable sub- population having neutral mutation. Another example is the maintenance of wild-type population along side with sub-population of advantageous mutants. Understanding such processes in bacterial colonies is an important subject by itself, as well as a model system for similar processes in other spreading populations.\narXiv:cond-mat/9811208\n\nHALIM, Amir Haikal Abdul, SAMAH, Khyrina Airin Fariza Abu, JONO, Mohd Nor Hajar Hasrol and RIZA, Lala Septem, [no date].

We resolve the issue of numerical efficiency of customized closed‐form and recursive forward and inverse dynamics algorithms for kinematically and dynamically structured manipulators. We find that ARM‐generated customized closed‐form algorithms are the most computationally efficient calculators of forward and inverse dynamics of three degree‐of‐freedom manipulators. For six DOF predominantly rotational manipulators, ARM‐generated customized recursive algorithms are the most computationally efficient foward and inverse dynamics algorithms; inverse dynamics can be computed in less than one millisecond on commercially‐available processors (in software, without special‐purpose hardware). In our companion article,\n              4\n              we compare the symbolic efficiencies of six robot dynamics formulations for generating closed‐form and recursive models.\n\nOLLA, Piero, 2015a.

A reinforced random walk is one which changes the weight of any edge (or vertex) visited to increase the frequency of return visits. The generating function for the discrete case is first derived for the joint probability distribution of $S_N$ (the location of the walker at the $N$^{th}$ step) and $A_N$ the maximum location the walker achieved in $N$ steps.

The foundational standards of the Web of Data include the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and the Resource Description Framework (RDF). URIs are used to identify resources and RDF is used to relate resources. While RDF has been posited as a logic language designed specifically for knowledge representation and reasoning, it is more generally useful if it can conveniently support other models of computing. In order to realize the Web of Data as a general-purpose medium for storing and processing the world’s data, it is necessary to separate RDF from its logic language legacy and frame it simply as a data model. Moreover, there is significant advantage in seeing the Semantic Web as a particular interpretation of the Web of Data that is focused specifically on knowledge representation and reasoning. By doing so, other interpretations of the Web of Data are exposed that realize RDF in different capacities and in support of different computing models.\narXiv:0905.3378 [cs]\n\nRODRIGUEZ, Marko A. and WATKINS, Jennifer H., 2010.

Topological photonics offers unique properties, including topological robustness and an anti‐backscattering property, and these advantages are strongly required in quantum optics. Quantum technology, which includes quantum optics, represents an important direction for future technological development. However, existing quantum light sources are unstable and quantum information may easily be lost during transmission. These disadvantages have troubled researchers for a long time and no perfect solution is available thus far. Fortunately, application of topological photonics to quantum optics can help to generate robust quantum light sources and protect photons from decoherence during photon propagation. This allows the correlation and entanglement to be maintained even when photons travel over long distances. To date, quantum topological photonics has provided major breakthroughs in certain quantum devices. This Review presents the basic concepts of quantum topological photonics and summarizes how the topological protection property works in quantum light sources, quantum information transmission, and other quantum devices. Finally, an outlook is provided on the remaining challenges and potential future directions of quantum topological photonics, which can aid in exploration of additional new phenomena.\n\nZHANG, George, CHRISTOV, Ivan C. and RAHMAN, Aminur, 2023.

DOI 10.1016/j.mechrescom.2023.104215. \nDiscrete dynamical models of walking droplets (“walkers”) have allowed swift numerical experiments revealing heretofore unobserved quantum statistics and related behaviors in a classical hydrodynamic system. We present evidence that one such model of walking droplets exhibits the empirically elusive $n$-bounce resonances that are traditionally seen in the scattering of solitary waves governed by covariant nonlinear field theories with polynomial self-interaction. A numerical investigation of the chosen model of interacting walking droplets reveals a fractal structure of resonances in the velocity in--velocity out diagram, much like the usual maps constructed for collisions of solitary waves. We suggest avenues for further theoretical analysis of walker collisions, which may connect this discrete model to the field-theoretic setting, as well as directions towards new experimental realizations $n$-bounce resonances.\narXiv:2304.06001 [nlin, physics:physics]\n"
