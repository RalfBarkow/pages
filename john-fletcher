Heim uses very much that same approach - as does [[String Theory]], for that matter; Kaluza-Klein was and is famous and influential in fundamental physics, because it was so successful. \"Merely\" adding still more dimensions to Kaluza-Klein in order to further unify the weak and strong nuclear forces turned out to be extremely problematic, but in a certain sense, [[String Theory]] is more or less just the most recent and most sophisticated approach to doing exactly that.",

Now we have access to a bigger Cray system. I have been working for some time with the [[Parallel Virtual Machine]] software and I am now changing to the [[Message Passing Interface]] software. Some tools, e.g [[Sca Lapack]], work with either. The challenge for me is integrating various different software tools, e.g. [[Daixtrose Lib]], with the parallel environment, where it has not been used before.

Heim uses very much that same approach - as does [[String Theory]], for that matter; Kaluza-Klein was and is famous and influential in fundamental physics, because it was so successful. \"Merely\" adding still more dimensions to Kaluza-Klein in order to further unify the weak and strong nuclear forces turned out to be extremely problematic, but in a certain sense, [[String Theory]] is more or less just the most recent and most sophisticated approach to doing exactly that.",

Now we have access to a bigger Cray system. I have been working for some time with the [[Parallel Virtual Machine]] software and I am now changing to the [[Message Passing Interface]] software. Some tools, e.g [[Sca Lapack]], work with either. The challenge for me is integrating various different software tools, e.g. [[Daixtrose Lib]], with the parallel environment, where it has not been used before.
