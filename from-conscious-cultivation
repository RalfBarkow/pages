Retreating to the Sunshine Coast for a long weekend, the staff team set about forming deep bonds and developing a collective vision. In order to build trust quickly and connect peer to purpose, Vicki asked us to share two artefacts, objects that spoke about us as individuals, personally and professionally. Undertaking this exercise saw many of our newly-connected team willing to become comfortable as they talked honestly about their vulnerabilities, sometimes with raw emotion. A very simple exercise, but one that rooted  a culture that honoured authentic voice, deep listening, and relationships. Each individual felt seen and heard in a way that illuminated each individual’s potential. Belonging was valued over fitting in from the very beginning.",
