These can stem from an over-concentration on problems that computation can solve, and the reduction of other projects to this frame. This derives from a tendency to see humanities scholarship through what we might call **the strong-encoding paradigm in digital humanities**, which argues for knowledge representation to be the core activity in the field. Whilst not wishing to diminish the importance of good encoding and markup practice, in the strong-encoding articulation of digital humanities as encoding, everything else is supplementary. In contrast, we argue that weak-encoding is a more pragmatic approach to the importance of encoding more generally, as part of a good practice associated with a balancing of the quality of, and comprehensiveness in, encoding a project. To put this another way, we don’t see the value of making the perfect the enemy of the good within the digital humanities.
