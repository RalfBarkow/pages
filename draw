A graph database is\nessentially a collection of nodes and edges. Each node represents an entity (such as a person\nor a business) and each edge represents a connection or relationship between two nodes. In\na graphical visualization, the edges are the lines that connect any two nodes. Every node in\na graph database is defined by a unique identifier, a set of outgoing edges and/or incoming\nedges, and a set of properties expressed as key/value pairs. Each edge is also defined by a\nunique identifier, a starting-place (node), and an ending-place (node), together with a set\nof properties. This essentially means that if one can [[draw]] a diagram of the data on a\nblackboard, then one can also store that data in a graph database.
