The idea here is to simplify/clarify the situation where you need to use a large number of local variables in a complex logical comparison and want to keep the expression(s) in the if/then/else statement(s) as short/simple/clear as possible. Without something that allows you to extract a method but still allow access to the local variables of the enclosing function scope, you are left with either passing everything you need into the extracted method (which often confuses things as much as just leaving the messy logical expression in-place), or making all the variables needed in the extracted method(s) instance variables of the enclosing class (confusing, too). Reading the D Language \"Quick Comparison\" table, I noticed that it supports the notion of \"Nested Functions\" which allow exactly the behavior desired. Serendipity is an interesting thing...",

The idea here is to simplify/clarify the situation where you need to use a large number of local variables in a complex logical comparison and want to keep the expression(s) in the if/then/else statement(s) as short/simple/clear as possible. Without something that allows you to extract a method but still allow access to the local variables of the enclosing function scope, you are left with either passing everything you need into the extracted method (which often confuses things as much as just leaving the messy logical expression in-place), or making all the variables needed in the extracted method(s) instance variables of the enclosing class (confusing, too). Reading the D Language \"Quick Comparison\" table, I noticed that it supports the notion of \"Nested Functions\" which allow exactly the behavior desired. Serendipity is an interesting thing...",
