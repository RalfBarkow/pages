I indicate how these common-sense questions can be correlated with the traditional branches of philosophy, namely, ethics, epistemology, aesthetics, and inductive and deductive logic.\n\n> I then examine each of the five segments in turn in order to justify the common-sense questions with which the segments have been tagged as well as to confirm the relevance of these questions to the branches of philosophy. I also correlate the five segments with the relatively adequate world hypotheses as well as the relatively inadequate ones, and I discuss their connection with the theories of truth and modes of verification which the relatively adequate theories generate.\n\n> Following the survey of the five segments, an integrated interpretation of the interrelationships of the world hypotheses and their theories of truth, beauty, and goodness is presented.\n\n> I next discuss Aristotle's causes and Kant's categories as apparent precursors of neoselectivism.\n\n> I conclude by mentioning five problems relevant to the root-metaphor theory worth future consideration.
