The inevitable Ontoclash between State and Commoners (as two systems of power and culture) must be resolved through a challenging, stepwise process assisted, if possible, through available legal forms. Remember: there is no panacea or off-the-shelf solution, but here are useful templates for enacting CPPs. "

DB: No, doesn't work in English. A \"wanted poster\" is a police poster with a suspected criminal profiled.] It is the initial document of any CPP Process.   \n\n- **STEP 2**: Based on this collective statement, the commoners draft a **charter of commoning** outlining their values, practices, organizing structure, and general approach. \nThis functions as a **social covenant** of shared purpose and commitment, which may well conflict with existing law and state priorities \n(In this stage, the dimensions of the [[Ontoclash]] become apparent).\n"

The precondition for negotiations is **respect and recognition** for a) the legitimacy of the commons based on the collective statement and the charter; and b) respect for the needs of the other party despite obvious differences and conflicting priorities between the two. \n\nThe relations between state & commoners resemble the diplomatic protocols among sovereign states, which are designed to assure safe, respectful, interstitial spaces for each party to exist and function.
