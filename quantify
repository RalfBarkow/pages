Therefore, people must be educated to describe the desired end states as precisely as possible.

        "text": "So it's a kind of tightrope walk: as much quantification as possible, but not so stubborn that it takes your eye off the other things that are just as important but not quantifiable. There is no general formula that can help one find the right measure. In individual cases, however, i.e. when the circumstances, situation, product, market, technology and, above all, the people are known, it is often possible to say quite accurately how far one can and must go with quantification."

        "text": "In any case, one must demand the greatest possible precision. This is still possible even if quantification in the narrower sense is no longer possible. How do we want to be able to determine and judge at the end of the next period whether we have come closer to the goal or not? – that must be the key question. Therefore, people must be educated to describe the desired end states as precisely as possible. As a little trick, you can require the perfect tense in the linguistic formulation: Not what do we want to achieve, but what should be achieved? The masters of linguistic precision are the good lawyers, even if they occasionally use their art to create confusion.\n"
