Plugins could be small modules written in JavaScript that define how to parse and display specific data types.\n\n2. **Dynamic Loading**: When encountering a new data type, the client could request a plugin from the server that knows how to handle that type. The server would dynamically load and transmit the plugin to the client.\n\n3. **Plugin Interface**: Plugins should adhere to a standard interface specifying methods for parsing and displaying data. This ensures interoperability and allows the client to interact with plugins in a uniform way.\n\n4. **Type Registration**: Plugins could register themselves with the server, indicating the types of data they can handle. This information could be used by the client to determine which plugin to request for a given data type.\n\n5. **Fallback Mechanism**: If no plugin is available for a particular data type, the client could fallback to a default handler or provide a generic representation of the data.\n\n6. **Security Measures**: Since plugins are dynamically loaded from the network, security measures should be in place to prevent malicious code execution. This could include sandboxing plugins or implementing code signing and verification mechanisms.\n\n7. **User Interface Integration**: The Federated Wiki user interface would need to seamlessly integrate with the plugin system, allowing users to interact with different data types in a consistent manner.\n\nBy implementing these features, Federated Wiki could provide a flexible and extensible platform for handling diverse data types, empowering users to customize their experience and adapt the system to their specific needs.
