A tacit capability of federated wiki is that it can be mobilised by skilled user-writers as an ‘awareness engine’. Here we develop our understanding of that capability, and of the gains to be made by DisCO workers, through **awareness of significant events and patterns**, as distinct from (and in relation to) the computation of value metrics.\n\n"
