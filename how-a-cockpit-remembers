        "text": "\"How a Cockpit Remembers Its Speeds\". Edwin Hutchins applies cognitive science to a unit of analysis that is larger than one person. A pilot and ethnographer of [flight decks], Hutchins paper is a fascinating deep-dive into an essential moment in the complex socio-technical system of commercial aviation.

However, memory tasks in the [flight deck] may be accomplished by functional systems which transcend the boundaries of the individual actor. Memory processes may be distributed among human agents, or between human agents and external representational devices."

        "text": "... The memory observed in the [flight deck] is a continual interaction with a world of meaningful structure. The pilots continually are reading and writing, reconstituting and reconstructing the meaning and the organization of both the internal and the external representations of the speeds. It is not just the retrieval of something from an internal store-house, and not just a recognition or a match of an external form to an internally stored template. It is, rather, a combination of recognition, recall, pattern matching, cross modality consistency checking, construction, and reconstruction that is conducted in interaction with a rich set of representational structures, many of which permit, but do not demand, the reconstruction of some internal representation that we would normally call the \"memory\" for the speed."
