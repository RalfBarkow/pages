If I work with this as user stories I would end up with parent-child user stories, in which case the parent doesn't have an estimation on itself, but the sum of all its found child user stories. An example could be: \"The game should be split in three editions: beginner, advanced, expert. This split main reason is to have a way of getting to the expert (full featured) game from easier editions.\". Is that OK, or are there examples of how this should be or shouldn't be done? Also, how about really particular details I think are really cool, but again, they depend very much on this game workings like \"The spy should get random information on the specified topic of research from the enemy city.\", this when I don't even have a city designed. Here, I could come up with several of this ideas, and I would rather like to store them somewhere, should I use something different that user stories or should I try to build myself a user stories relationship system (like a 3 level abstraction level, where level 2 is actually the one that gets estimated (someday)?

This cannot happen, this is why XP is for. Not to give deadlines that you really don't know about well, in the plans I used to give about 2-3 weeks of an item called \"User Stories and Interface\" it was a good sell for them (both my CEO and the Customer). What I did is that I used to meet with the customer, and I did write the user stories. And I changed the Metaphor concept a bit for each user story I had a page as a prototype and when user stories are complete into a scene I rushed back to the customer to get their feedback on the prototype and from the user stories I had tasks. I am a project manager, and I am not away from the code, so I meet with the developers, and we estimate on the user stories, and I make sure to down size the tasks to a day for each now I have a plan according to the PMI standards and in fact I am doing the iteration according to the XP and I have a milestone (a release) and I had the developers estimate and each developer can come to my office to get his/her user story, and with the user story there is an attached document representing the page from the prototype. All what I know is the pile of user stories is vanishing in the speed of light. I really love XP and I really owe a big thank you for the great people who made my life happy - the people who invented this XP.",

If I work with this as user stories I would end up with parent-child user stories, in which case the parent doesn't have an estimation on itself, but the sum of all its found child user stories. An example could be: \"The game should be split in three editions: beginner, advanced, expert. This split main reason is to have a way of getting to the expert (full featured) game from easier editions.\". Is that OK, or are there examples of how this should be or shouldn't be done? Also, how about really particular details I think are really cool, but again, they depend very much on this game workings like \"The spy should get random information on the specified topic of research from the enemy city.\", this when I don't even have a city designed. Here, I could come up with several of this ideas, and I would rather like to store them somewhere, should I use something different that user stories or should I try to build myself a user stories relationship system (like a 3 level abstraction level, where level 2 is actually the one that gets estimated (someday)?

This cannot happen, this is why XP is for. Not to give deadlines that you really don't know about well, in the plans I used to give about 2-3 weeks of an item called \"User Stories and Interface\" it was a good sell for them (both my CEO and the Customer). What I did is that I used to meet with the customer, and I did write the user stories. And I changed the Metaphor concept a bit for each user story I had a page as a prototype and when user stories are complete into a scene I rushed back to the customer to get their feedback on the prototype and from the user stories I had tasks. I am a project manager, and I am not away from the code, so I meet with the developers, and we estimate on the user stories, and I make sure to down size the tasks to a day for each now I have a plan according to the PMI standards and in fact I am doing the iteration according to the XP and I have a milestone (a release) and I had the developers estimate and each developer can come to my office to get his/her user story, and with the user story there is an attached document representing the page from the prototype. All what I know is the pile of user stories is vanishing in the speed of light.
