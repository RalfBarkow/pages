      "text": "Beck thus implicitly rewrites Norbert Elias's idea of an ongoing process of civilization of the individual, in which individuality and socialization are inextricably interwoven: \"More and more people,\" Elias was still saying, \"lived in growing dependence on one another, while each individual at the same time became more different from all the others.\" Nevertheless, individuals always remained related to collectives in their individuality and identity – Elias speaks of a \"figuration\" at this point. In this figuration, the human being is not separated from \"[[We]]\"-connections such as the family, occupational groups, social milieus. However, the late Elias perceived a shift from the we-ego balance to the I-we balance in the 1980s. The term balance is not chosen quite happily, since Elias actually points to an imbalance based on a changed weighting of the components: While the importance of occupational groups or families decreases, the I moves to the foreground, but it remains connected to the we-forms."
