UGA's Kyu Lee said, &quot;We were able to use machine learning technology to figure out what much of the activity is without even having to decrypt the information.&quot; Lee said the information smart hubs send to individual devices can be deciphered by &quot;using patterns, the size of the packet, and the timing of the packet.&quot; Hackers can acquire this information without positioning ChatterHub close to the hub, nor do they require prior knowledge of the types of smart devices to which it is connected or the hub's manufacturer to breach the system remotely."
