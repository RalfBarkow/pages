In such models desirable graphs for anti-virus protection would be those with small q1 and for R&D networks those with large q1. We believe that there are situations in which viruses or [[Knowledge]] move along lazy random walks rather than along standard random walks. This can be expected in situations when the vertices when receiving something from their [[Neighbor]]s are likely to respond back with some action."
