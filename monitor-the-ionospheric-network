      "text": "The ESA MONITOR network is composed of high-frequency-sampling global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) receivers deployed mainly at low and high latitudes to study ionosphere variability and jointly with global GNSS data and ionospheric processing software in support of the GNSS and its satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS) like the European EGNOS. In a recent phase of the project, the network was merged with the CNES/ASECNA network and new receivers were added to complement the latter in the western African sector. This paper summarizes MONITOR, presenting two case studies on scintillations (using almost 2 years of data measurements). The first case occurred during the major St. Patrick’s Day geomagnetic storm in 2015. The second case study was performed in the last phase of the project, which was supported by ESA EGNOS Project Office, when we paid special attention to extreme events that might degrade the system performance of the European EGNOS."

It is dedicated to the collection, processing, and archiving of ionospheric data and products during active periods of solar activity; the development of improved scintillation monitoring instrumentation; and the establishment of a scintillation monitoring network in order to build the appropriate infrastructure for analysing the impact of the ionosphere on European GNSS (EGNOS and Galileo) system performance. The receivers deployed for the project have been installed both in low and high latitudes, which are the two main regions where the ionosphere might be the cause of EGNOS decreases in performance. The lowlatitude sector is also of interest for evaluating the constraints for a possible extension of EGNOS in Africa in the future."

At low latitudes, the stations in western Africa were deployed to complement the five stations of the CNES/ASECNA SAGAIE network (Stations ASECNA GNSS pour l’Analyse de l’Ionosphère Equatoriale) (Secrétan et al., 2014). This was done in mid2015. Both the MONITOR and SAGAIE stations in Africa are shown in Fig. 1. All low-latitude stations have Septentrio PolaRxS receivers. At high latitudes there are three stations, in Kevo and Sodankylä in Finland and in Kiruna in Sweden. The receivers used are the PolaRxS in Kevo and Kiruna and the NovAtel 4004B in Sodankylä. The PolaRxS receiver is a modern receiver. It is capable of recording data from the three constellations GPS, GLONASS and Galileo on two frequencies, while the NovAtel receiver corresponds to an old version of this receiver with a reduced capability: only the L1 frequency for the scintillation indices and the GPS constellation."

The scintillation characteristics and their dependency on the geophysical parameters were studied using the data recorded in 2015 and 2016. This represents 1.5 years of high-rate GNSS data for six receivers and almost 2 years for five receivers. The extreme case studied was the St. Patrick’s Day magnetic storm of March 2015, which is the most important storm to occur so far during this 24th solar cycle."
