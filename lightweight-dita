Those features, while useful for large projects, can also intimidate practitioners and academics interested in learning about DITA. LwDITA is a proposed standards-based alternative that offers a starting point for simple structured authoring scenarios that remains fully compatible with DITA XML and is more accessible to professional communicators who do not work in XML-based authoring workflows."

While these formats do not have the same expressiveness as XML, they bring with them a set of tools and practices that can be a natural fit with a DITA ecosystem. LwDITA acknowledges the importance and popularity of lightweight languages and includes mappings for HTML5 and Markdown, thus becoming the first version of DITA to be truly cross-format —allowing authoring and delivery in a mix of native formats that are all mapped to a common semantic standard."
