IDE4PLC is based on an abstract model of controller, what enables it to support different controller architecures, and on a software model which strictly complies the IEC 61131-3 standard. It is a free, open and multiplatform (Windows, Linux, IOS) product, contrarily to most PLC programming environments and tools, which are tightly coupled with device vendors. This product is developed mainly by Eric Pernia. Carlos Lombardi collaborates with the software design."
