      "text": "> In this paper we consider the duality between process and concept in mathematics, in particular using the same symbolism to represent both a [[process]] (such as the addition of two numbers 3+2) and the product of that process (the sum 3+2). The ambiguity of notation allows the successful thinker the flexibility in thought to move between the process to carry out a mathematical task and the [[concept]] to be mentally manipulated as part of a wider mental schema. We hypothesize that the successful mathematical thinker uses a mental structure which is an amalgam of process and concept which we call a [[procept]]. We give empirical evidence to show that this leads to a qualitatively different kind of mathematical thought between the more able and the less able, causing a divergence in performance between success and failure."
