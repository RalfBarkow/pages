(1 hour)\n- __Q&A__ Pete summarizes the discussions, then facilitates Q&A. (0:30, then 0:15 break)\n- __[[Wikidojo]]__: any may participate. A \"pilot\" drives a shared screen as they edit wiki for 7 minutes; a \"navigator\" verbally guides. (1 hour)\n\n__Conclusion__ (further planning needed) Needs to tie in themes of One World, climate change/One Football, social justice, journalism, and promote opportunities to remain engaged.\n"
