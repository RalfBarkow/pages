      "text": "By adapting the concept of form from the Laws of Form (Spencer-Brown), Luhmann's sociological systems theory gained a context of differentiation theory. The theoretical figures of binary schematization and thus code formation (elaborated in detail in Luhmann 2017,461-518), which are interpreted as autocatalytic moments of system formation in the context of symbolic generalization (Luhmann 1975,176 f.), were thus conceptually upgraded and theoretically elevated to an epistemological level of a prior necessity of making distinctions (Goebel 2000,216-222). For Luhmann, this results in what he calls the two-sided form: \"Following suggestions that can be taken from George Spencer Brown's calculus of forms, we understand form to mean the marking of a boundary with the result that two sides emerge and only one of them can be used as a point of contact for further operations. The transition to the other side is thus not excluded; but it requires a special operation, thus takes time and differs in its logical implications from what happens if one remains on the same side and only condenses and confirms the designation of this side. A form is therefore always a two-sided form. It can only ever be used as a form on one side (i.e. always only incompletely). But it is equally true that an observer (and this can also be the user of the form) can only see the form if he sees it as a two-sided form.\" (Luhmann 1991c, 166). For the operation this means: \"The operation is never at two points in time at the same time, it is not a divine actuality, but it presupposes the simultaneity of the two sides of the distinction and thus the simultaneity of the world in order to be able to move in a before/after difference.\" (Luhmann 1992,80 f.)"

In order to make this plausible, Luhmann's interpretation of the Laws of Form (Spencer-Brown) must be rejected. This is done by assuming that an indication produces an indeterminacy instead of necessarily performing a differentiation. The stability of two-sided forms is only produced through the repetition of a violence that produces them. In a first step, the Laws of Form are reconstructed as a sequence of commands in the medium of the visual-simultaneous and Luhmann's transfer to sequentially executed communication events is rejected (I). This makes it possible to mark différance as a constitutive indeterminacy of social operations (II). The restriction of the radical indeterminacy of différance in two-sided forms is traced with the operation of compensation and marked as epistemic violence (Spivak) (III). This violence gains its authority decisively from repetition (IV). The interruption of this repetition can succeed through critique. The article concludes by proposing to the systems theory of critique that critique be understood as the interruption of the authority of repetition (V)."

        "text": "Mit der Adaption des Formbegriffs aus den Laws ofForm (Spencer-Brown) gewann die soziologische Systemtheorie Buhmanns einen unterscheidungstheoretischen Begründungszusammenhang. Die in der Werksgeschichte Buhmanns schon früh entwickelten Theoriefiguren der binären Schematisierung und damit der Code-Bil­ dung (ausführlich ausgearbeitet in Buhmann 2017,461-518), die im Zusammenhang mit der symbolischen Generalisierung als autokatalytische Momente einer System­ bildung interpretiert werden, (Buhmann 1975,176 f.) wurden dadurch begrifflich aufgewertet und theoretisch auf eine epistemologische Ebene einer vorgängigen Notwendigkeit des Treffens von Unterscheidungen gehoben (Goebel 2000,216-222). Für Buhmann resultiert daraus das, was er Zwei-Seiten-Form nennt: „Im Anschluß an Anregungen, die man dem Formenkalkül von George Spencer Brown entnehmen kann, verstehen wir unter Form die Markierung einer Grenze mit der Folge, daß zwei Seiten entstehen und nur eine von ihnen als Anknüpfungspunkt für weitere Operationen benutzt werden kann. Der Übergang zur anderen Seite ist damit nicht ausgeschlossen; aber er erfordert eine spezielle Operation, braucht also Zeit und unterscheidet sich in seinen logischen Implikationen von dem, was geschieht, wenn man auf derselben Seite bleibt und die Bezeichnung dieser Seite nur kondensiert und konfirmiert. Eine Form ist demnach immer eine Zwei-Seiten-Form. Sie kann als Form immer nur auf einer Seite (also immer nur unvollständig) benutzt werden. Aber mit gleichem Recht gilt, daß ein Beobachter (und das kann auch der Benutzer der Form sein) die Form nur sehen kann, wenn er sie als Zwei-Seiten-Form sieht.“ (Buhmann 1991c, 166). Für die Operation bedeutet das: „Die Operation befindet sich nie an zwei Zeitstellen zugleich, sie ist keine göttliche Aktualität, aber sie setzt die Gleichzeitigkeit der beiden Seiten der Unterscheidung und damit die Gleich­ zeitigkeit der Welt voraus, um sich in einer vorher/nachher-Differenz bewegen zu können.“ (Buhmann 1992,80 f.)"

The theoretical figures of binary schematization and thus code formation (elaborated in detail in Buhmann 2017,461-518), which are interpreted as autocatalytic moments of system formation in the context of symbolic generalization (Buhmann 1975,176 f.), were thus conceptually upgraded and theoretically elevated to an epistemological level of a prior necessity of making distinctions (Goebel 2000,216-222). For Buhmann, this results in what he calls the two-sided form: \"Following suggestions that can be taken from George Spencer Brown's calculus of forms, we understand form to mean the marking of a boundary with the result that two sides emerge and only one of them can be used as a point of contact for further operations. The transition to the other side is thus not excluded; but it requires a special operation, thus takes time and differs in its logical implications from what happens if one remains on the same side and only condenses and confirms the designation of this side. A form is therefore always a two-sided form. It can only ever be used as a form on one side (i.e. always only incompletely). But it is equally true that an observer (and this can also be the user of the form) can only see the form if he sees it as a two-sided form.\" (Buhmann 1991c, 166). For the operation this means: \"The operation is never at two points in time at the same time, it is not a divine actuality, but it presupposes the simultaneity of the two sides of the distinction and thus the simultaneity of the world in order to be able to move in a before/after difference.\" (Buhmann 1992,80 f.)"
