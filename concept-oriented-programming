Notice that when a method is applied to a custom reference, the object native (direct) reference is not known and actually the object may reside anywhere in the world.

On the other hand, the programmer still manipulates objects as if they were represented by direct native references (in the same way as in OOP) so we have the illusion of instant action. ",

An important consequence is that many extension reference-object pairs may exist within one base reference-object pair, i.e., a base reference-pair can be shared among extensions (in OOP it is not so). Thus elements in CoP exist within a hierarchy at run-time just as at compile-time. This hierarchy is analogous to the conventional postal addresses where many streets exist in one city, many houses exist in one street and so on. In our example, inclusion is used to include many buttons into one parent panel and therefore we say that one button is <b>IN</b> a panel. In contrast, in OOP if a button class inherits a panel class then one button <b>IS</b> a panel at run-time. Button within a panel are distinguished by their references (described in the reference class). Another important difference from OOP is that parts of objects in CoP (base and extensions) are represented by their own references and may have different locations. So panel object may have one address in memory while button object has another location, for example, on disk. ",

Normally such base reference methods are used to inject some additional behaviour or to wrap target object methods into some common function. For example, base reference methods might draw background, perform security checks etc. In other words, reference methods play a role of incoming methods of some scope like panel or button.

Usefully, in addition to the normal benefits of controlling interaction with environment, this provides a mechanism for mobile code (a mobile code chunk is an abstract unit of code that needs a set of local resources in order to run) and supports coordination languages for actor/process configurations and [[Dataflow Programming]].

Thus elements in CoP exist within a hierarchy at run-time just as at compile-time. This hierarchy is analogous to the conventional postal addresses where many streets exist in one city, many houses exist in one street and so on. In our example, inclusion is used to include many buttons into one parent panel and therefore we say that one button is <b>IN</b> a panel. In contrast, in OOP if a button class inherits a panel class then one button <b>IS</b> a panel at run-time. Button within a panel are distinguished by their references (described in the reference class). Another important difference from OOP is that parts of objects in CoP (base and extensions) are represented by their own references and may have different locations. So panel object may have one address in memory while button object has another location, for example, on disk. ",
