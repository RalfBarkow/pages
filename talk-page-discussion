Now a word for the lazybones like me and you: The [[Talk Page]] concept relieves you from scrolling down 'endlessly' on [[Home Page]]s of \"old\" Wiki folks who keep their whole collection of decades of experience there. One simply clicks the talk page link on top of the home page and add Your comment on that without scrolling (to much). I for example keep my talk page short by deleting answered questions. Also You do not have to remember <b>any</b> stuff. You can implement [[Talk Page]] right now for Your home page whilst this discussion is fresh on Your mind. Or You just leave it as is, because no bureaucracy - no duress, as it is the habit on this wiki. And, whenever You encounter a home page that is complemented by a talk page, there would be a link to click to it. No need to remember anything. This concept is ideal for the weak and forgetful mind. It does not put any stress on it. --[[Manorainjan Holzapfel]]",
