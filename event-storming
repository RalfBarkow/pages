However, you should not implement complex peer-to-peer event chains. Using commands to coordinate other services will reduce your coupling even further.\n\n> Centrally managed ESBs don’t fit into a microservices architecture. Smart endpoints and dumb pipes are preferable. However, don’t dismiss coordinating services for fear of introducing central control: important business capabilities need a home.\n\n> In the past, BPM and workflow engines were very vendor-driven, and so there are many horrible “zero-code” tools in the market scaring away developers. However, lightweight and easy-to-use frameworks now exist, and many of them are open source. \n\n> Do not invest time in writing your own state machines, but instead leverage existing workflow tools. This will help you to avoid accidental complexity.\n\n_several of those points sound like services version of introducing Method Objects in object decomposition to decouple related entity models from the operations which change and connect them. _"
