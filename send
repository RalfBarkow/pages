        "text": "A term coined by [[Alan Kay]] to describe a way of using computers.  In Early History Of Smalltalk, Alan Kay explains how after seeing Seymour Papert's work with [[Logo Language]] he grew to see personal computing less as a \"personal dynamic vehicle\" and more as a \"personal dynamic medium\".  Instead of the computer being primarily used for its capacity to perform computation, what if it were used as a medium for communication?  Not just as a way for people to send each other text, or pictures, or sound, but as a way to send each other active, \"live\" simulations of their ideas?",
