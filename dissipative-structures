Dissipative structures are characterized by irreversibility and by probabilistic and non-linear change.\n\nDissipative structures tend to arise in situations - chemical, biological or social - which are in a state for from equilibrium. At or near equilibrium (Le Chatelier’s Principle in chemistry), a disturbance will cause the system to shift slightly to maintain its equilibrium or a series of small fluctuations will average out around the equilibrium point Far from equilibrium, a very different situation occurs. A small fluctuation can be amplified throughout file system if it occurs near a threshold or bifurcation point When this occurs, the change is not determined but subject to probability. Some of the possible outcomes lead to a self-organizing process resulting in higher or different types of order, while others lead to disorder.\n\nThe early work on dissipative structures came out of thermodynamics and chemistry where questions about entropy and its irreversible nature were contrasted with classical physics and chemistry with its reversible dynamics. Current researchers are also studying the phenomena of dissipative structures in living systems which are operating far from equilibrium. Their work has made it possible to describe the dynamics of familiar problem areas, such as traffic management, which are characterized by the impact of local events when the system's normal operating capacity is near threshold levels.\n# SOURCE\nGlansdorff, P .
