A belief that from the mind, the world outside of the mind could be analyzed in a way that we could break it down and understand its components in greater detail until, ultimately, reality and all of its parts could be known. This conviction, called 'reductionism', framed the basic premise of how we could define and understand reality. A reality that was ultimately completely 'knowable'. "
