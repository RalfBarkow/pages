      "text": "According to Maly, “digital media have given birth to a new form of [[populism]]: [[algorithmic populism]]”; they are “not just new media that populists use, their algorithms and affordances reshape populism” (Maly 2018, 1). He offers a definition of populism as a mediatized chronotopic communicative and discursive relation. Understanding populism as a chronotopic phenomenon allows us to examine it in the specific context of the time and place in which it occurs. As Maly (2018, 8) argues, populism presupposes (1) a person able to mobilize an anti-elite discourse “in the name of the sovereign People” through communication; (2) specific knowledge of people’s demands and needs that a populist claims to represent; (3) other actors labeling the communicator a populist; (4) a media infrastructure (including digital media); and (5) a certain number of followers to legitimize the person-communicator. Populism as a mediatized communicative relationship can therefore be understood as “the result of a complex interplay between all of these different elements.”\n"
