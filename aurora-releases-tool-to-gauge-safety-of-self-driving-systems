Aurora&apos;s Chris Urmson said the Safety Case Framework provides a &quot;structured approach&quot; to assessing the safety of autonomous vehicles on actual streets, featuring four levels of claims associated with the safe development, testing, and evaluation of the company&apos;s self-driving systems, as well as required supporting evidence. The framework supports a systematic approach to assessing the vehicles&apos; safety, as well as metrics for measuring progress across their full development cycle.
