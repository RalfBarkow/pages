      "text": "The Makerspace can be a mental space, a place in my mind where my muscle memory, experience and snippets of experience live, where both my triumphs and failures live. I want to push the limits of our idea of a Makerspace. I want to challenge us to think about the possibility that a Makerspace exists as a mental space within our students as a mental Maker Space. We can develop this space to shape it and hone it over years of development in K-12 education. We can build students that can make something out of nothing, that are regularly in “flow”, that ask “how did they build that?” that find a niche for themselves to make themselves useful and themselves be the solution… the plan. The maker space in our students house these three sets, but also is fueled by students’ passion, plugs into their empathy and in turn will propel them into 21st century careers. Yes, that is plural… We have to be OK with students’ no longer envisioning themselves on a 30 year linear career. As our students make themselves useful and follow their passions they will enter new fields through their mindsets and building new skill sets on different tool sets. \n"
