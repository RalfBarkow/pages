We then formed an organization called the [https://www.rosewoodinitiative.org/ Rosewood Initiative] that built a space of belonging, a community center on the corner of 162nd and Stark. And, in that space, Jenny and her staff firmly planted the intention of unconditional belonging. The doors are open, everyone belongs. "
