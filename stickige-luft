Strategically, the policies of the extreme right are aimed primarily at the Christian Socialist governing party CDA. The agrarian entrepreneurs traditionally represent an important clientele of the party, which, however, has increasingly turned away from it in recent years and threatens to lose them completely with the current protests."

Inverted national flags are being hung up throughout the Netherlands as a sign of support; at sea, the resulting color sequence of blue-white-red used to be regarded as an SOS signal. In recent years, this symbol has appeared mainly at demonstrations against the government's pandemic protection measures; it is a trademark of the conspiracy-believing to extreme right-wing milieu."

Baudet's party, in particular, initially succeeded in presenting itself as an ally of the farmers' protests and already appeared in 2019 as the parliamentary arm of the FDF."

With the predominantly medium-sized and small farms, they can appeal to a romanticized symbol of national entrepreneurship and rural labor. The established enemy images of the EU, so-called globalists, large international corporations and the climate movement appear as \"natural opponents\". Strategically, the policies of the extreme right are aimed primarily at the Christian Socialist governing party CDA. The agrarian entrepreneurs traditionally represent an important clientele of the party, which, however, has increasingly turned away from it in recent years and threatens to lose them completely with the current protests."

Parts of the protest movement are turning away from the established lobby associations such as the Land- en Tuinbouworganisatie (Agriculture and Horticulture Organization, LTO) and toward smaller, militant splinter groups. They are increasingly making [[logistics chains]] of large agricultural companies such as Campina or supermarket chains such as Lidl, Aldi and Poiesz the target of their actions, for example by blockading distribution centers. In this way, they are protesting against the price policy of the concentrated retail capitals."
