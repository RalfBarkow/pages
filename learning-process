Or if you think formal schooling is structurally inevitable in a society with more disensus than consensus, again keep them in school. These are reasons of politics, and they plainly have a place in any debate, for education is political too. But if you see children learning mathematics by rote, you can also say (this time on more naturalistic yet practical grounds) that somebody got confused about models and slipped in an empiricist one in place of a constructionist one. In a word, the best approach to models of the learner is a reflective one that permits you to \"go meta,\" to inquire whether the script being imposed on the learner is there for the reason that was intended or for some other reason. >> go meta"
