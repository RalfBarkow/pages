This may relate to the midlevel reuse problem. A possible solution is a proper factoring between [[Data Oriented]] and [[Information Oriented]] techniques. Rather than having one new class for each table in a database, one could have some generic code for doing things like updates, inserts, deletes etc and drop table specifications into them for them to process. These specifications would be a form of information rather than being [[Data Oriented]] because the context of each column would be non-literal within these methods. Each of these methods would be reused over many of the tables in the database rather than having a version of each of these methods existing for each table. The benefit would be that these methods would be available for developing middle tier code and reuse within middle tier code would operate off of these methods. Add in [[En Deme]]s for characterizing the tables and therefore writing the middle tier code, and you have significant potential for reuse of mid sized components. -- [[Jon Grover]]",

Rather than having one new class for each table in a database, one could have some generic code for doing things like updates, inserts, deletes etc and drop table specifications into them for them to process. These specifications would be a form of information rather than being [[Data Oriented]] because the context of each column would be non-literal within these methods. Each of these methods would be reused over many of the tables in the database rather than having a version of each of these methods existing for each table. The benefit would be that these methods would be available for developing middle tier code and reuse within middle tier code would operate off of these methods. Add in [[En Deme]]s for characterizing the tables and therefore writing the middle tier code, and you have significant potential for reuse of mid sized components. -- [[Jon Grover]]",
