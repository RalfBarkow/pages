It ‘‘explains the dynamics as endogenous consequences of the feedback structure’’ (Sterman 2000), and explicitly states how structure and decision policies generate behavior (Richardson and Pugh 1981). Moreover, ‘‘The inclusion of basic mechanisms from the outset forces the modeler to address a meaningful whole at all stages of model development.’’ (Randers 1973). That is, a dynamic hypothesis is the key to ensuring that the analysis is focused on diagnosing problematic behavior and not on enumerating the unlimited details of a ‘‘system’’."
