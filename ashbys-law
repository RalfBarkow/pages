In reality, managers are allowed considerable freedom to deviate within their budget allocation and that is true all the way up. So it works because it is only a negotiable framework. The CFO always has \"hidden\" pools of money to even things out. Even the board can chose to obtain more money mid year if they so decide. So there you go, much ado about nothing.\n\nFor what it is worth, I never once looked at the details of any of my directors budgets. And I frequently got them extra money when they needed it and I even had them return money when they had spare money. They knew the game as did everyone else. The budget just allowed earlier signal detection and encouraged conversations for adjustment not punishment. We were managing a hospital."
