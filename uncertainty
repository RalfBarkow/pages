Seeds planted in the spring are expected to yield summer flowers, but a late frost may kill the young plants. On the other hand, waiting until all chance of frost has passed guarantees a late blooming garden so most of us choose to run some risk.

In quantum mechanics, uncertainty is endemic in the design of experiments or the choice of the 'observation situation'. To quote Heisenberg,\n\" ..in quantum theory the uncertainty relations put a definite limit on the accuracy with which positions and momenta, or time and energy, can be measured simultaneously.\"\n\nFurther, it became apparent that while the experiment itself could be designed to take objective (and reproducible) measurements, that the inferences and conclusions drawn from the experiments could no longer be accepted without qualification because the measurement iiself intrudes into the event and cannot be separated from it."
