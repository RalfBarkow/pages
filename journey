Here the source domain (journey) is informed by our bodily physicality, and information about the body (such as its capacity for locomotion) shapes the way in which love is understood and conceptualized. Metaphors, hence, are not merely useful for embellishing communication, but reflect the embodied experience that we have as creatures that move through the world in particular ways."
