Only by the fact that plans are not fulfilled? You don't even know why they're not being fulfilled, but they're not being fulfilled, so you have to put on top or cut back or whatever? Or is there a sensitivity to highly aggregated economic data – the origin of which is not so well known either, but the economic institutes are considered reliable – about unemployment, inflation, the external value of the currency, to which one responds with a policy for which one can emphasize various policy options? Not under the conditions of state planning, but under the conditions of open sensitivity to economic indicators of going well or going badly, one can imagine a democratic opposition. Because then you can say that you think the situation is threatening or temporary and that you propose Keynesian instruments or think that the market will help itself, you just have to be patient and watch. The political options are more open than in the case of state planning, democracy in this sense is possible according to our understanding, and at the same time the probability of a politically resounding economic disaster is lower. If all this is true! I am formulating this now only as a model to show that there are possible solutions which react more strongly to complex environmental situations which they themselves did not create and which do not just note the effects of their own activities – \"What we wanted cannot be done or is being done or is not being done\" – but which can develop a kind of sensorium for problems which are independent of them. In terms of the economy, this would mean that political rationality grows as system rationality, as the property of the political system to take note of and be able to process more environmental states."

Can the legal system juridify, i.e. introduce into the legal process, a change in society through general institutes such as property, contract, constitutional law and fundamental rights? Is the legal system rigid because the paragraphs are textually fixed, so that it can only register unlawful versus lawful? Or is the way legal terms are formulated, institutes made, and procedures laid out capable of making more information legally relevant given texts? For example, compared to the early modern period or even the Middle Ages, we have much more sophisticated procedures for testing subjective facts. In the past, it would have been an impossible idea to consider the will of the person making the contract legally relevant, because it would not have been possible to determine the will or the motives at all. With the type of procedures we have today, however, we dare to do this, however well it is done then."
