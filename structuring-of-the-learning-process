      "text": "The use of multimedia teaching materials in digital networks leads to new scenarios of tele-learning, which are especially interesting with regard to the social aspect of learning. Compared to individual learning with (multi-) media or traditional distance learning, more intensive forms of communication become possible both between learners and between learners and teachers. For instructional design, therefore, the problem arises of how to stimulate and support interpersonal communication in relation to course objectives in such a telematic learning environment. The article describes different models of support in tele-learning scenarios and discusses their design based on didactic dimensions and criteria. It is argued that the still divergent sub-disciplines of instructional science such as instructional technology, instructional theory, and distance learning theory need to be brought together to develop adequate concepts and models of instructional design for tele-learning."

The service consists of providing and designing the possible teaching content and learning opportunities in such a way that they are suitable for the learner (as a member of a specific target group). (The service consists of making the learning content accessible to the learner (as a member of a particular target group with prior knowledge and learning goals)). For example, the chaotic variety of information available on the Internet, which is often of little value, promotes the desire for clearly structured, high-quality, and time-limited learning opportunities. In addition, time-limited offerings ensure a more homogeneous increase in knowledge and competence in the learning group, which can be used as a basis for joint communication and cooperation. Time limits also make it easier to supervise learners. Time limitation also facilitates communication among the participants, e.g. it is known at any time which topics and questions the distance learners are currently dealing with.\n"

(2000): Betreuung des Lernens in telemedialen Lernumgebungen, Unterrichtswissenschaft, 28 (3), S. 257 - 277.\n> Implementing multimedia course materials in digital networks introduce new scenarios of tele-learning which are interesting especially with regard to the social aspect of learning. Compared to individual learning with(multi)media or traditional distance education programs more intense ways of communication both among learners and between learners and teachers become possible. Hence, instructional design faces the problem how to stimulate and encourage interpersonal communication related to course objectives in such a telematic learning environment. The article describes different models of support in tele-learning scenarios and discusses their design by means of instructional dimensions and criteria. It is argued that yet divergent sub-disciplines of instructional science like instructional technology, instructional theory as well as theory of distance education have to conjoin in order to develop adequate concepts and models of instructional design for tele-learning."

Compared to individual learning with (multi-) media or traditional distance learning, more intensive forms of communication become possible both between learners and between learners and teachers. For instructional design, therefore, the problem arises of how to stimulate and support interpersonal communication in relation to course objectives in such a telematic learning environment. The article describes different models of support in tele-learning scenarios and discusses their design based on didactic dimensions and criteria. It is argued that the still divergent sub-disciplines of instructional science such as instructional technology, instructional theory, and distance learning theory need to be brought together to develop adequate concepts and models of instructional design for tele-learning."
