Yes, the space where teachers spend their days with twenty-five or more small humans needs to be a reasonably ‘nice’ place to dwell, perhaps even inspiring, organised and homely. But educators should also be challenged to consider purpose carefully when constructing their classroom environment so that they can identify how the environment directly impacts student learning. "

Traditional visible elements like alphabet displays around the ceiling, themes and coordinated teacher-constructed static displays might look wonderful but these decorations don't impact students and their learning. What is placed on walls must be of value to learning. "

Students use their environment to support them as they inquire, practice and master new skills and understandings. Spaces have the potential to powerfully influence learning - if educators let them.

Teachers can involve learners in the co-construction of the physical and visible classroom environment. The artefacts that are placed on the walls should make the learning that is taking place visible and include tools that learners can access to support them as they learn. The walls are dynamic, unfolding and changing as the learning does. "

Murdoch describes four components of the classroom environment in her book, ‘The Art of Inquiry’ – [[The Physical Classroom Environment]], [[The Emotional Classroom Environment]], [[The Visible Classroom Environment]] and [[The Intellectual Classroom Environment]]. Intentionally curating these four components are what matters most for learning in classrooms. "

They’ve helped us to spell out, to get more intentional about what’s physically in our space, how we communicate what we value, how we use areas and the more subtle details that can’t necessarily be seen, put up on a wall or represented by a poster, like the emotional space we create.
