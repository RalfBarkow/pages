In a distributed network, this can be likened to a wave-front propagating through the network. The system can maintain as many copies of any object as it likes, with as many aliases as are convenient. The only uniqueness constraint is that within any transitive closure, each alias resolves to one and only one object. In this kind of environment, \"[[Object Identity]]\" is preserved, but softly. A [[Big Idea]] for me was to realize that ANY externalized name for an object in such an environment is specific to a namespace - whether a [[Primary Key]] in a relational database, an index in an object table, and address in memory, whatever.

An \"Account\" object has a version and provides the ability to answer a \"balance\" (I prefer to hide the specifics of whether the balance is itself an object or is instead a possibly cached computation). An Account object may also provide for some or all of its clients behavior that allows its state to change, such as \"deposit\" or \"withdraw\". In such a case, the Account is \"softened\" - a copy of the current version is created, but such that its contents can be modified. This softened object is <b>not</b> available to any other computations. When the appropriate change in value is finished, the soft Account object is \"hardened\" and assigned a version. Each \"hard\" object has its own version identifier, different from whatever version identifier the Account object had when the computation began. A different behavior of the Account (or its container) manages which of the hardened versions of the Account is the \"current\" account. Reconciliation (and synchronization) of multiple parallel changes is handled by this second behavior. Please note that each of those changes is retained as its own hardened version; the reconciler might need to walk those and construct its own merged version of the changes. I hope this helps.",

Instead of attempting to manage the change process through transactions, the system sends sets of changed objects together - a [[Unit Of Work]]. In a distributed network, this can be likened to a wave-front propagating through the network. The system can maintain as many copies of any object as it likes, with as many aliases as are convenient. The only uniqueness constraint is that within any transitive closure, each alias resolves to one and only one object. In this kind of environment, \"[[Object Identity]]\" is preserved, but softly. A [[Big Idea]] for me was to realize that ANY externalized name for an object in such an environment is specific to a namespace - whether a [[Primary Key]] in a relational database, an index in an object table, and address in memory, whatever.

An \"Account\" object has a version and provides the ability to answer a \"balance\" (I prefer to hide the specifics of whether the balance is itself an object or is instead a possibly cached computation). An Account object may also provide for some or all of its clients behavior that allows its state to change, such as \"deposit\" or \"withdraw\". In such a case, the Account is \"softened\" - a copy of the current version is created, but such that its contents can be modified. This softened object is <b>not</b> available to any other computations. When the appropriate change in value is finished, the soft Account object is \"hardened\" and assigned a version. Each \"hard\" object has its own version identifier, different from whatever version identifier the Account object had when the computation began. A different behavior of the Account (or its container) manages which of the hardened versions of the Account is the \"current\" account. Reconciliation (and synchronization) of multiple parallel changes is handled by this second behavior. Please note that each of those changes is retained as its own hardened version; the reconciler might need to walk those and construct its own merged version of the changes. I hope this helps.",

(This also includes situations like using objects as keys in a mapping.) Then, in any particular case, it will usually be obvious whether directly using the identity operator will do what you want, or whether you need to explicitly code a different operation to test for \"sameness\". In general, using the identity operator won't work iff the identity of the objects does not canonically correspond to whatever notion you want to use in determining sameness. (If they do correspond, consider also whether this is a maintainable property of the design or just an artefact of the current implementation.) >> artefact implementation"
