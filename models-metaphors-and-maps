Then they may choose to create (design) solutions and take actions to bring about their chosen changes. All of this can be represented by graphs. By graph I do not man bar charts or pie charts, I mean a certain kind of visual model that shows the purposeful parts in relationship. These graphs can be overlaid onto geographic maps, showing the location of actors, institutions, locations (points and areas). Now we have something pretty useful for designing and problem solving together. Also we have a way to dramatically reduce the number of potential participants to those 1) **interested** in the particular purpose, 2) living in **proximity**, 3) those **able** to participate in design, implementation and operating in a different way. And we can show all of this on a familiar map of our places—the places where we live and work and play."

For this we need more than our handy sociographs. For this we need Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model (VSM) and a couple of other tools. Happily we can extend our variety reducing sociographs to serve double duty. We can shape it to the structure of Beer’s VSM. And to great effect. With the VSM we get the wisdom and the structure that keeps every living system alive. We just have to learn how to use it to keep our own social systems (associations, businesses and governments) alive and healthy.

There are a large number of choices available for making changes and for managing the new situation—we must manage implementations and operations in an ongoing way in an ever changing world with ever changing population, actors, governments, institutions. For this we need more than our handy sociographs. For this we need Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model (VSM) and a couple of other tools. Happily we can extend our variety reducing sociographs to serve double duty. We can shape it to the structure of Beer’s VSM. And to great effect. With the VSM we get the wisdom and the structure that keeps every living system alive. We just have to learn how to use it to keep our own social systems (associations, businesses and governments) alive and healthy. We must make our co-designed solutions viable—sustainable, adaptable.\n"

There are a large number of choices available for making changes and for managing the new situation—we must manage implementations and operations in an ongoing way in an ever changing world with ever changing population, actors, governments, institutions. For this we need more than our handy sociographs. For this we need Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model (VSM) and a couple of other tools. Happily we can extend our variety reducing sociographs to serve double duty. We can shape it to the structure of Beer’s VSM. And to great effect. With the VSM we get the wisdom and the structure that keeps every living system alive. We just have to learn how to use it to keep our own social systems (associations, businesses and governments) alive and healthy. We must make our co-designed solutions viable—sustainable, adaptable.\n"
