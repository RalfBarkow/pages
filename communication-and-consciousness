      "text": "The leading observational distinction of recent (sociological) systems theory is that of system and environment. The scandalizing power of this (sociologically understood) difference lay in the fact that it could be used to arrange psychological and social operations into a reciprocal system/environment relationship. Theory categorically separated social and psychological systems and then had to (re)develop or import pieces of theory that were able to deal with the unity of the thus separated, for example the pieces of theory of [[Interpenetration]] and [[Structural Coupling]]. In any case, the effect was a strategy that made social systems free of consciousness and psychological systems free of communication. In this way, it was possible to break the intellectually annoying relationships anchored in the classical whole/part scheme (Beinhaltungsverhältnisse) (for example: people are parts of social systems)."

The gain was the opening up of new possibilities of analysis that were no longer dependent on the epistemological blockades of the whole/part and subject schema. However, the consequential problem was that the specification of the relevant psychological environment of social systems was not really successful. Terminologically, this difficulty can be traced in the historical sequence of terms such as personal system, psychic system, system of consciousness. Even today, all of these terms and neighboring terms such as the curious psychophysical system still haunt the relevant literature. There is talk of the personal, psychic, conscious environment, and it is already quite unclear what the body is all about, which (at least in the classical conception) would somehow be the carrier (leg holder) of the psychic. The only thing that was clear was that the compact word \"human\" did virtually nothing to characterize the relevant environment of social systems, just as little as the semantically diffuse concepts of the individual or the subject."

They would not be tragic if the conceptual instruments that are currently lacking could be patiently developed. But there is also the possibility of tracing confusions of this kind back to deeper theoretical problems that play a peculiarly subversive role even before the splitting of the system world into psychological and social systems, problems that have to do with the concept of system itself, paradoxical problems that denote a much more massive scandal. For the time being, we call such problems ONE=TWO=ONE problems."

This model was justified insofar as it made it possible to organize cognitive interests according to system references. One could concentrate on social systems or on psychological systems, temporarily leave aside the excluded as a moment of the environment and, if necessary, change the references, first this, then that, then this again ... and in this oscillation, findings that could be related to each other and presented sequentially were generated. This procedure was efficient (and still is, if necessary), but it could not take into account that the oscillation between system and environment (and systems in the environment) allows system and environment to condense, as it were, like objects to which one can align oneself. The object of systems theory was then the system-within-an-environment. One had to deal with society, politics, law, art, science, the economy, organizations and, on the opposite side, with the psychic (conscious) systems. All these systems 'lay', so to speak, in reciprocal interlocking relationships (for example, companies as subsystems of the economy, churches as subsystems of religion), all these systems 'had' environments that were handled like 'levies', as a kind of 'ambience'."

The system, according to the canonical formula, is the difference between system and environment. It is neither the one nor the other side of the difference, which is complicated insofar as the unitary concept of differentiation (the system is the difference system/environment) is differentiated once again in the difference (system/environment). This is not simply the case of a classical re-entry of a differentiated thing into the differentiation by which it is differentiated, not simply a re-entry such as in the case where someone differentiates system and environment and then checks on the side of the system how this very differentiation is treated there. Instead, we are dealing with the crude problem of a self-denying distinction, which – once served – 'twists' its unity (system) in such a way that this very unity appears as one side of a duality, in which it then represents the unity (despite being a half, so to speak). Perhaps one can also (for lovers of metaphors) speak of a 'circular' distinction, in which each designation of the system invokes the difference, within which the designation reappears, which – itself designated – functions as a sign of unity that invokes the difference, and so on."

It cannot be immobilized and generates a continuous loss of information for an observer who works with it by forcing him into the quasi-ontology of object-systems. In the repertoire of rhetoric, the metaphor is the expression for a figure of meaning that cannot be 'linearized' in terms of information. And in this sense, too, one could say that the word system is a metaphor that cannot be surpassed at the moment, insofar as, as an abbreviation (with, so to speak, an inner inconclusiveness), it allows research to be carried out that refrains from this very inconclusiveness."

It says (in the reading I ([[Peter Fuchs]]) choose) that – firstly – everything that appears generates its epiphany historically (this is what the adjective 'conditioned' means), and – secondly – that this generation is bound to the economy of a unity that is only a duality for one observer. As little as there is the master without the servant, the servant without the master, as little as there are neither masters nor servants, so little 'exists' one side of the difference (the system) without the other side (the environment). The metaphors of entanglement, interlocking, coupling, interpenetration, but also of the boundary are inadequate in view of this. They are already worked within the framework of an occult ontology of space."

The system/environment difference that runs between social and mental systems would then be a difference of differences of the same kind (i.e. system/environment), which would be subject to a peculiar obfuscation that can no longer be represented graphically: the mental system is the difference of system/environment, so it has no self-sufficiency, no sui-sufficiency, because in the difference by which it (? ), the environmental processors (social systems) are also labeled; the social system is the difference of system/environment, so it has no self-sufficiency, no sui-sufficiency, because in the difference by which it is labeled (?), the environmental processors (mental systems) are also labeled."

This contracture creates the counterparts communication and consciousness, which, if you like, become direct opponents. They are then each other's immediate (relevant) environment. Neither side of this difference can contain the other, but can only designate it in its own autopoiesis. There are no overlapping relationships, otherwise we would have an amalgam and no difference. And therefore a medium must be added that is neither the one nor the other system, indeed no system at all. This medium is called sense in its most abstract form. It is, if you like, a kind of unifying factor, because it instructs the formation of form on both sides of the one difference by modalizing every designation that arises in the context of psychic or social operations, or, in a slightly different turn: by using the difference of actuality/potentiality that is indispensable for every observation. Or – in a simpler mnemonic formulation: sense is this modalization."

Some people will find this assumption easy when it comes to communication, but in the logic of conditioned co-production the same would apply to the opposite side, to the psychic (conscious) system.

Worse still: if one crosses the side, the side that he does not designate disappears for the observer, as if without transition. One reason for this is that the observer (the observation) always and only operates positively, i.e. designates and not: does not designate. This means that the observer can only arrive at opinions about different things in the world one after the other, only in sequences; he operates, to use Spencer-Brown's words, selectively blind, otherwise he would only arrive at nothing. One only smells an odor, not the non-odor, not the particular absence by which the odor impresses; one notices the pain, not the non-pain, this particular absence that is inverse to the pain.

The schema itself is rejected. \"The very choice is rejected.\" Whether consciousness is the perception of what 'happens' in the mind of man (Locke), whether a distinction is made between perception (externalization function of the monad) or apperception (knowledge, reflection of what is present in perception) (Leibniz), whether Descartes is consulted or Kant, Brentano, Husserl, Sartre, whether it is about zombies or the question of qualia – at the moment when there is consistent talk of practiced difference, of co-production, objects drop out and unobjects appear. This is precisely what [[Niklas Luhmann]] expresses when he insists that the WHAT question must be replaced by the HOW question."

If we take these considerations to the extreme, we have said that consciousness, by reading out signs, creates meaning that communication cannot create because it does not perceive signs. On the other hand, consciousness (if we understand it as a sign-using, determined operativity) has these signs from the from-where-else of the social sphere, or - less spatially - from the opposite side of the distinction, from the co of production. It therefore does not create its meaning. And if it did, how would that work at all? Creating meaning?"

The operation of communication breaks down, if you will, compact streams of behaviour into the selections information, communication, understanding, and by generating selections (temporally, through incessant supplements that constitute the selectivity of lectures), it realizes the form of meaning, but the signs that are used, scattered, taken up, discarded or forgotten by not being taken up, it does not understand these signs, their meaning is not presented to it. It is precisely not: conscious. The operation projects, to use a slight variation of Sigmund Freud's metaphor relating to consciousness, a surface of meanings that mean nothing for the communication."

It is the inscription of the non-private into the psychic system and in this sense is not mono-produced but co-produced. It operates on socially supplied stocks. What has been traded in a long history as the proprium of the human being (the disposal of consciousness) is not the proprium, but the non-proprium. In this respect, intuitions that man is actually a social animal were anything but wrong. The metaphor of the socio-cultural (second) birth of man (or that of his plasticity, his instinctual decoupling) is also thoroughly instructive."

The distinguishing of differences (uno actu with the designation of one or the other side of the distinction) is already meaningful, is already linked to the possibility of meaning, to the illumination of a selection area by the designation, and ultimately, as we want to assume, to the use of signs. The externalization performance of the neuronal system (the creation of a world out there) would only lead to a smoothly compact sequence, a super-dense noise, if consciousness did not create images and events through which, for example, inside/outside or before/after would come about, or in short: a continuous modalization that would be inconceivable without signs or without meaning."

In social system reference, this thesis is evident (assuming the theoretical apparatus discussed here). It is possible to talk about singular, individual, idiosyncratic consciousness, to assert its existence, to write novels that demonstrate all this, but whether it is talked about or written about, in each case the staging is linked to the generality of the reservoir of signs used and is only possible if a minimum of standardization is involved."

This model was justified insofar as it made it possible to organize cognitive interests according to system references. One could concentrate on social systems or on psychological systems, temporarily leave aside the excluded as a moment of the environment and, if necessary, change the references, first this, then that, then this again ... and in this oscillation, findings that could be related to each other and presented sequentially were generated. This procedure was efficient (and still is, if necessary), but it could not take into account that the oscillation between system and environment (and systems in the environment) allows system and environment to condense, as it were, like objects to which one can align oneself. The object of systems theory was then the system-within-an-environment. One had to deal with society, politics, law, art, science, the economy, organizations and, on the opposite side, with the psychic (conscious) systems. All these systems 'lay', so to speak, in reciprocal interlocking relationships (for example, companies as subsystems of the economy, churches as subsystems of religion), all these systems 'had' environments that were handled like 'levies', as a kind of 'ambience'."

        "text": "The combination of system-theoretical, difference-theoretical and finally observation-theoretical motifs, as which sociological systems theory can be seen today, no longer allows the system/environment difference to be understood as a difference of positions in the world, as constellations, as a this (system) and that (environment) in a kind of spatial configuration. This model was justified insofar as it made it possible to organize cognitive interests according to system references. One could concentrate on social systems or on psychological systems, temporarily leave aside the excluded as a moment of the environment and, if necessary, change the references, first this, then that, then this again ... and in this oscillation, findings that could be related to each other and presented sequentially were generated. This procedure was efficient (and still is, if necessary), but it could not take into account that the oscillation between system and environment (and systems in the environment) allows system and environment to condense, as it were, like objects to which one can align oneself.5 The object of systems theory was then the system-within-an-environment. One had to deal with society, politics, law, art, science, the economy, organizations and, on the opposite side, with the psychic (conscious) systems. All these systems 'lay', so to speak, in reciprocal interlocking relationships (for example, companies as subsystems of the economy, churches as subsystems of religion), all these systems 'had' environments that were handled like 'levies', as a kind of 'ambience'."

Neither the one side of the distinction nor the other can be described in terms of being, of [[Essence]], of self-existence. There is, this is the deeply scandalous consequence, not consciousness, not communication – except for observations that pay attention to the TWO of the ONE of co-production or are already set up for the consequences of despair. This assessment is scandalous because in the course of evolution we have become accustomed, with every conceivable evidence, to at least conceiving of consciousnesses as entities circulating within themselves, as my or your consciousness, at any rate as something that is itself in its place and to which everything else is therefore opposed. And even sociology would run into decisive difficulties if it had to reject its basic theorem (namely that there are social facts sui generis), comparable in this respect to psychology, which would have to abandon the idea that it has any (reconstructible) object."

Mesh and non-mesh, figure and ground, communication and consciousness do not permit the simultaneous designation of the inside and the outside of the distinction. Worse still: if one crosses the side, the side that he does not designate disappears for the observer, as if without transition. One reason for this is that the observer (the observation) always and only operates positively, i.e. designates and not: does not designate. This means that the observer can only arrive at opinions about different things in the world one after the other, only in sequences; he operates, to use Spencer-Brown's words, selectively blind, otherwise he would only arrive at nothing. One only smells an odor, not the non-odor, not the particular absence by which the odor impresses; one notices the pain, not the non-pain, this particular absence that is inverse to the pain. And of course you hear someone speaking, and not: the 'structured' silence that speech produces on its opposite side."

The operation of observation is obviously always placed on the side; it is, one could say, never other than superpositive. Whatever is marked in it is, if one chooses the common expression, the inside of the form. In this respect, the operation is always acute. The crossing does not lead to the opposite side of the form (to the recess occurring in each current operation), but only generates the time (this Brownian tunnel) that allows us to move to another inner side in succession, i.e. to mark, for example, the side that was previously acutely blocked out."

Only after going through the calculus can (should) it be recognized that the first marker has been 'confused' with the observer. The construction of the beginning by \"Make a distinction\" must be substituted afterwards, at the end (at the beginning) by: \"Be an observer!\" Or better in the future tense II: Designate, and you will have become an observer, which you already were. And: you will have seen that in the first marking (which was never the first after the game of calculation will have been played) you were already anchored on the inside of the form.

It cannot be inscribed in them because (as one could also say) in every operation the unwritten cross cannot be designated without it disappearing: i.e. being written.

No consciousness diffuses into the social system. In the communication, the processor is (re)constructed to which utterance acts are attributed. For this reason, one can formulate that in the communication, external and self-reference are combined – in a move through which the relevant other of communication (consciousness) appears operationally in the communication process: as the imputation of an acting instance, as its imagination."

It holds up no flags, blares no fanfares, it has no face in which eyebrows are raised. The meaning of the signs is completely unknown to it. The operation of communication breaks down, if you will, compact streams of behaviour into the selections information, communication, understanding, and by generating selections (temporally, through incessant supplements that constitute the selectivity of lectures), it realizes the form of meaning, but the signs that are used, scattered, taken up, discarded or forgotten by not being taken up, it does not understand these signs, their meaning is not presented to it. It is precisely not: conscious. The operation projects, to use a slight variation of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s metaphor relating to consciousness, a surface of meanings that mean nothing for the communication."

        "text": "Taken more seriously, the question arises as to how this reading out (which would then be the special achievement of the schema side consciousness in the distinction between communication and consciousness) functions. If we take these considerations to the extreme, we have said that consciousness, by reading out signs, creates meaning that communication cannot create because it does not perceive signs. On the other hand, consciousness (if we understand it as a sign-using, determined operativity) has these signs from the from-where-else of the social sphere, or – less spatially – from the opposite side of the distinction, from the co of production. It therefore does not create its meaning. And if it did, how would that work at all? Creating meaning?"
