Our brains, locked inside the confines of a skull, have the unenviable task of trying to determine the causes of our sensory signals. By using predictive models to determine our perception, our brains are able to go beyond the data of our senses to form, what feel like, concrete experiences of phenomena in the world.\n\nIn a sense, our brains are constantly trying to solve what philosophers call an inverse inference problem, where we don’t have direct access to the causes of our sensory signals. Our sensory signals are the effects of phenomena out there in the world that do not necessarily reflect the nature of the causes that produced them. And with this limited data, our brains fill in the missing gaps by producing models that predict their causes. "
