        "text": "The aim of this paper is to consider how `Now and So' can be now and so. The theory of social systems as a second order observer observes the phase `Now and So' in system time of a first order observer because it is always a blind spot for the first order observer. For this purpose, (1) I will formulate the theory of social systems by [[Niklas Luhmann]] as \"[[Sociological Phenomenology]]\": Parallel to consciousnesses, social systems are observed not as things but as subjects in the world. However, (2) contrary to phenomenological sociology, I start not from `the problem of meaning is a problem of time' but from `the problem of time is a problem of meaning'. This means that system time is a meaningful construction. Finally, (3) I show that the phase `Now and So' can be now and so through the distinction of past/future. In whole system time, an event as an element of the system can appear and disappear in the present."
