This is for one reason only - latency and the fact that PC hardware is shit and very hard to do IO with through passing messages.  The graphics interface is through the HAL which is ring 1 and the UI is at the same level but can only pass messages to the GDI HAL. It's as secure as any other OS structured in this way.

Ring 1 in pure microkernels shouldn't have direct hardware access but it does in NT. This is for one reason only - latency and the fact that PC hardware is shit and very hard to do IO with through passing messages.  The graphics interface is through the HAL which is ring 1 and the UI is at the same level but can only pass messages to the GDI HAL. It's as secure as any other OS structured in this way. In many ways it's superior as from a usability point of view in its target markets, it's spot on.",
