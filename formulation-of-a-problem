It went without saying that the expertise itself, as updated through oneâ€™s experience, would allow the practice of that profession until retirement. The tacit assumption involved in that world view was that the knowledge base evolves slowly, an assumption then already losing validity. Today, we face an explosive growth of knowledge; by any measure, our knowledge base is doubling every few years. How do we, as a human culture, prepare ourselves and our children for this world in which the knowledge base turns over many times within a single human lifetime?
