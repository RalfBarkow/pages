Drawing conclusions from an experimental measurement requires a good understanding of the experimental setup that was used to obtain the measurement. A scientist interpreting them must know the reliability and precision of the devices that were used, and be familiar with potential artifacts that could lead to misinterpretations. Likewise, the computational results obtained from scientific software can only be interpreted with a good understanding of what exactly the software does. Scientific software therefore has the same status in science as experimental setups and theoretical models."

We expect experimentalists to explain the materials and methods they have used, and theoreticians to explain their reasoning in sufficient detail that their peers can understand it. We should thus treat computational science in the same way and require scientific software to be published and scrutinized in peer review."
