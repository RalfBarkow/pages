As a user, we could describe our needs for power as being reliable, utility like, provided in standard forms and accessible. From the [[perspective]] of examining an online photo service then a single component is enough. However, that single component will break into an entire map for an electricity provider including different forms of transmission, generation and even spot markets. A single node on one map can be an entire map from another person’s perspective. Equally, the entire map of your business might be a single component for someone else.
