In 20th century already the idea of interregnum was uh updated to the present condition and I am following partly uh [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s reformulation of the meaning of interregnum separating it from succession of Kings or dynasties and putting it in the contemporary context and what he said was that interregnum is a state in which the old way way of doing things don't work any longer but the new ways of doing things have not been invented yet. And we are precisely in condition of Interregnum we know that the when we fall back on our memories and our routines on things which were tested before and seem to be working we are expecting a uh uh defeat we are taking enormous risks we are just playing a a a hazardous game we are in a sense groping in the dark."
