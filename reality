And truth is inevitably misjudged, if one does not gain it again and again, against one's own dispositions, against one's comfort, against the limitation of one's own perspective. Truth begins to emerge only when one has physically exposed oneself to reality and subjected one's own perception, the concretion of this perception in thoughts, and the linguistic representation of these thoughts to a long, never-ending series of corrections."
