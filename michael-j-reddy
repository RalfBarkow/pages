      "text": "In linguistics, the conduit metaphor is a dominant class of figurative expressions used when discussing communication itself. It operates whenever people speak or write as if they \"insert\" their mental contents (feelings, meanings, thoughts, concepts, etc.) into \"containers\" (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) whose contents are then \"extracted\" by listeners and readers. Thus, language is viewed as a \"conduit\" conveying mental content between people. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conduit_metaphor wikipedia]"
