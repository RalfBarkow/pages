How much of a program, or whatever, follows naturally from its other parts. That's why its related to but distinct from things like good, beauty, symmetry, etc. Compare something like running quickly, which is a good thing to have but is not what most people would call this. The name <i>wholeness</i>, which was just mentioned here, I think supports this.",

Alexander constantly uses phrases like \"system X ... has more life than system Y\". This \"having life\" is a synthesis of beauty and function. The only problem here seems to be that the English language has no good word for it. The words \"lively\" and \"liveliness\" could have been candidates, but it seems they do not sound profound enough for Alexander. In German, this problem does not exist; the words \"lebendig\" and \"Lebendigkeit\" are exactly to the point. So in German the quality actually has a name. -- [[Helmut Leitner]]",
