They “act into knowing” according to Göran Henriks, the director of Qulturum since its inception. Their health system results have become famous. Healthcare and government leaders make the pilgrimage here from across the world. Many try to imitate it. I have traveled there four times, a week at a time, to understand what the dynamics are around this place—[[Qulturum]].\n"
