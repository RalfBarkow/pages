Turing Award in 1999 for his landmark contributions to computer architecture, operating systems, and software engineering. Columbia University's Steven Bellovin recalled Brooks' time at IBM, where he led the design of the S/360 mainframes, which comprised five models with distinct performance characteristics, sharing a common architecture-defined instruction set. At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Brooks focused on computer graphics and protein modeling, and pioneered virtual reality by using a remote manipulator arm to &quot;grab&quot; and move atoms with accompanying force feedback."
