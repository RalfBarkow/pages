But as much as it may correspond to a practice, it contradicts the idea of a [[Functional Differentiation]] of [[Politics]] and [[Economy]], as it becomes established in modernity, in order to be able to understand and describe the relations of society that are no longer hierarchically ordered. A subjection also of the merchants and financiers to the power of the prince was in contradiction to the dependence of this prince on the money of the merchants and financiers. This contradiction, which had already preoccupied Plato and Aristotle in their attempts to establish a constitution of the \"just\" city, had to be resolved; and it could be resolved only by making it theoretically invisible and practically useful. Political theory registers a permanent state of exception, a reason of state that must always be reweighed, and an exercise of power that can only be secured arcane because it must be accepted, if not initiated, by those over whom it is exercised. >> functional differentiation politics economy"

It played no small role that this public credit succeeded in establishing a regime of relatively low interest rates, which no longer had much to do with earlier usurious interest rates and was thus also able to appease the church's ban on interest."

These banks are the \"monstrosity,\" the thing that eludes the gaze and thus has to be shown, to which Vogl's interest is directed. For here, an economic calculation of securing capital is bundled with political strategies of securing the monetary system, which in a functionally differentiated society, if one believes its liberal ideology, should not be left to any decision, but only to the free play of forces."

Vogl hesitates, because analytically he has to make the same distinction between politics and economics, state and capital, power and money, which he questions empirically. So what is the status of this difference? Are we dealing with insufficient theoretical means, a misunderstanding of practice, or in fact with an ideologically more than welcome blind spot, the elucidation of which will acquaint this \"capitalist\" society with itself in an entirely new way? Vogl opts for a combination of ideology critique and political enlightenment, for a late Marxist purified theory of capitalism, which no longer cherishes revolutionary expectations, but also does not refrain from lamenting the loss of political sovereignty, as if this could be regained by democratic means. It does not leave it at the analysis of a heterogeneous singularity, but subscribes, on the one hand, to the diagnosis of a theoretical coherence that goes by the name of \"capitalism\" and, on the other hand, to the justification of a political expectation that aims at not completely abandoning the intention of a control of society – and not only: of politics – by democracy. >> democracy"

Its historical knowledge becomes part of a debate that can have practical consequences and become theoretical argument. This, then, is the aim of [[Dirk Baecker]]'s objection to this spot-on and highly stimulating book. Vogl underestimates the possibility of using the theorem of functional differentiation to analyze the function of central banks as well. And he underestimates the possibility of understanding capital and power in a way that, by differentiating them, is also able to reveal their entanglement. Both possibilities are worth recalling here, because only then can the debate about the contribution of the hybrid construction of finance to triggering financial crises be meaningfully pursued."

        "text": "\"The antagonism of politics and economics itself creates a blind spot, it obscures the fragile system boundary and the processes of functional de-differentiation\" (p. 25). Vogl hesitates, because analytically he has to make the same distinction between politics and economics, state and capital, power and money, which he questions empirically. So what is the status of this difference? Are we dealing with insufficient theoretical means, a misunderstanding of practice, or in fact with an ideologically more than welcome blind spot, the elucidation of which will acquaint this \"capitalist\" society with itself in an entirely new way? Vogl opts for a combination of ideology critique and political enlightenment, for a late Marxist purified theory of capitalism, which no longer cherishes revolutionary expectations, but also does not refrain from lamenting the loss of political sovereignty, as if this could be regained by democratic means. It does not leave it at the analysis of a heterogeneous singularity, but subscribes, on the one hand, to the diagnosis of a theoretical coherence that goes by the name of \"capitalism\" and, on the other hand, to the justification of a political expectation that aims at not completely abandoning the intention of a control of society – and not only: of politics – by democracy."

Ihr Narrativ verknüpft sich den Narrativen, die sie untersucht. Ihr historisches Wissen wird zum Teil einer Debatte, die praktische Folgen haben und theoretisches Argument werden kann. Darauf zielt denn auch mein Einwand gegen dieses punktgenaue und äußerst anregende Buch. Vogl unterschätzt die Möglichkeit, das Theorem der funktionalen Differenzierung auch zur Analyse der Funktion der Notenbanken zu nutzen. Und er unterschätzt die Möglichkeit, Kapital und Macht auf eine Art und Weise zu verstehen, die mit ihrer Differenzierung auch ihre Verschränkung offenzulegen vermag. An beide Möglichkeiten ist hier zu erinnern, denn nur dann kann die Debatte über den Beitrag der hybriden Konstruktion des Finanzwesens zur Auslösung von Finanzkrisen sinnvoll weitergeführt werden.\n"

Its historical knowledge becomes part of a debate that can have practical consequences and become theoretical argument. This, then, is the aim of my objection to this spot-on and highly stimulating book. Vogl underestimates the possibility of using the theorem of functional differentiation to analyze the function of central banks as well. And he underestimates the possibility of understanding capital and power in a way that, by differentiating them, is also able to reveal their entanglement. Both possibilities are worth recalling here, because only then can the debate about the contribution of the hybrid construction of finance to triggering financial crises be meaningfully pursued."
