Our thinking about systems and their role in improving humans’ quality of life has evolved over the last two decades. We now understand better that successful systems do not materialize in a haphazard way. Rather, they must be carefully architected just like edifices, accounting for the needs, wants and requirements of their intended beneficiaries, and alternative architectures—ways in which these desired functions are embodied in form. These early decisions are critical to the system-to-be, as they determine the concept to be followed and consequently the whole direction the system development takes and the nature of the final outcome: how well the system performs in terms of delivering value, i.e., benefit at cost, while maintaining the other requirements of safety, robustness, ease of use, environmental friendliness, and many others."
