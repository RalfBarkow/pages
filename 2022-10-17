Exactly the same applies to today's software engineering.\n\nDoes it have to be hard? Essential difficulties\n\nNot only are there no silver bullets in sight right now, the nature of software sort of guarantees that they never will be: Inventions that do for productivity, reliability, and simplicity in software what electronics, transistors, and high integration have done for hardware do not exist, and doubling every two years is even less likely. The first observation is that it is not the slow pace of development in software that is the anomaly, but the tremendous pace of development in hardware. No other technology since the dawn of civilization has seen its price/performance ratio change by six powers of ten in the course of 30 years, and in no other technology can one choose so freely between higher performance and lower costs. This growth stems from the fact that computer manufacturers have undergone a fundamental transformation: Process chemistry replaced the assembly of individual parts.\n\nTo answer the question of what rate of progress we can expect in software, the second recommended approach is to examine its difficulties. In this point following Aristotle, I distinguish here between the essence - the difficulties, which are inherent in the nature of the software - and the Akzidenz:, the problems, which we have today with their production, which are however not inherent on their part.\n\nAccidence is the subject of the next section. So let us first consider the essence.\n\nThe essence of a software entity is a construct of interwoven concepts: Data sets, relationships between the one-\n Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)"

Roger B. Blumberg. Second International WWW Conference '94. http://found.ward.bay.wiki.org/web-as-public-space.html\n\nThanks :) good stuff. I still find a need, though, for a distinction between ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ space.\n\nThe former is where bodies and artefacts (including ‘me’) materially are, and materially determine one another. The latter is where a life is consciously lived and relationships are consciously enacted, and includes all sorts of people and places that are not immediately present or even currently existing.\n\nAs it happens I like ‘space(s)’ for this latter reference. So I use ‘place(s)’ for the former. The stuff we make in these digital media are more space than place, in this sense? But of course, both. Every action and every artefact is both!"

And in many cases, the time aspect is underexposed in such speculations. Interactions, organizations, and world society all need to synchronize somehow. The clock becomes a crucial function. Croquet, for example, sells us simulation time or virtual time or a central metronome with its reflector network. Craig Latta's Beatshifting is an example of how to play together, an example for collaborative, synchronized, and out-of-phase musical performances. In return, so to speak, I ask for companionship on my journey to find my own pace/tempo."

The gray sphere that appears is a button to open the property sheet. If you control- or alt-click the object again, it switches to a rotator with three rings.

I still find a need, though, for a distinction between ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ space.\n\nThe former is where bodies and artefacts (including ‘me’) materially are, and materially determine one another. The latter is where a life is consciously lived and relationships are consciously enacted, and includes all sorts of people and places that are not immediately present or even currently existing.\n\nAs it happens I like ‘space(s)’ for this latter reference. So I use ‘place(s)’ for the former. The stuff we make in these digital media are more space than place, in this sense? But of course, both. Every action and every artefact is both!"

Roger B. Blumberg. Second International WWW Conference '94. http://found.ward.bay.wiki.org/web-as-public-space.html\n\nThanks :) good stuff. I still find a need, though, for a distinction between ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ space.\n\nThe former is where bodies and artefacts (including ‘me’) materially are, and materially determine one another. The latter is where a life is consciously lived and relationships are consciously enacted, and includes all sorts of people and places that are not immediately present or even currently existing.\n\nAs it happens I like ‘space(s)’ for this latter reference. So I use ‘place(s)’ for the former. The stuff we make in these digital media are more space than place, in this sense? But of course, both. Every action and every artefact is both!"
