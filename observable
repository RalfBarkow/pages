It has an underlying collection or computation that produces values that can be consumed by a consumer. But the difference is that the consumer doesn't \"pull\" these values from the producer like in the Iterator pattern. It is exactly the opposite; the producer 'pushes' the values as notifications to the consumer. (Tsvetinov - 2015 - Learning reactive programming with Java 8 â€¦, p. 7, context: [[RxJava]])"
