Based on a successful school improvement effort in Melbourne, Australia, these manuals are designed to help teachers, instructional coaches, school leaders, and system administrators embark on a professional journey to lift student literacy, numeracy, and curiosity. Written originally for Australian educators, the theories of action and recommended activities outline practices that have been tested and refined in schools over time and can be adapted and used by schools and districts around the world, including the U.S."

I have two minds about loading such .vrse file and what to do with the translation. So if you drop a 3D model file from the OS filer into microverse, the 3D model does appear in front of your avatar. But if you construct something with parts, and recreate it in a different world, you want to retain the original translation.\n"

A Greenlight installation looks for them relative to its path. I think we have not made most of their code available yet (that was our plan, though). So to make some of them work, you can change the code (around this definition https://github.com/croquet/greenlight-core/blob/0fb8dd18e470a0f5de36a51ad2ce4938d23dc0ed/src/pitch.js#L1820) to refer to the installation at croquet.io.

Based on a successful school improvement effort in Melbourne, Australia, these manuals are designed to help teachers, instructional coaches, school leaders, and system administrators embark on a professional journey to lift student literacy, numeracy, and curiosity. Written originally for Australian educators, the theories of action and recommended activities outline practices that have been tested and refined in schools over time and can be adapted and used by schools and districts around the world, including the U.S."

        "text": "D scene graphs have recently emerged as a powerful high-level representation of 3D environments. A 3D scene graph models the environment as a layered graph where nodes represent spatial concepts at multiple levels of abstraction (from low-level geometry to high-level semantics including objects, places, rooms, buildings, etc.) and edges represent relations between concepts. While 3D scene graphs can serve as an advanced “mental model” for robots, how to build such a rich representation in real-time is still uncharted territory. This paper describes a real-time Spatial Perception System, a suite of algorithms to build a 3D scene graph from sensor data in real-time. Our first contribution is to develop real-time algorithms to incrementally construct the layers of a scene graph as the robot explores the environment; these algorithms build a local ESDF around the current robot trajectory estimate, extract a topological map of places from the ESDF, and then segment the places into rooms using an approach inspired by community-detection techniques. Our second contribution is to investigate loop closure detection and optimization in 3D scene graphs. We show that 3D scene graphs allow defining hierarchical descriptors for place recognition; our descriptors capture statistics across layers in the scene graph, ranging from low-level visual appearance, to summary statistics about objects and places. We then propose the first algorithm to optimize a 3D scene graph in response to loop closures; our approach relies on embedded deformation graphs to simultaneously correct all layers of the scene graph. We implement the proposed system into a highly parallelized architecture, named Hydra, that combines fast early and mid-level perception processes with slower high-level perception. We evaluate Hydra on simulated and real data and show it is able to reconstruct 3D scene graphs with an accuracy comparable with batch offline methods, while running online."
