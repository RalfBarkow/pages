These come from software, I guess, and that software is a tool for someone, just not for me.\nSome people talk about software craftsmanship. This rests somewhere between art and engineering. We can also distinguish the user of a tool and the tool maker. There is still applied to the craftsman some notion of accomplishment using tools. (Aside: I use these terms as gender neutral.)"

What are the landmark papers and what tools did they describe? When is software not a tool? What was the prevailing metaphor for software that preceded the tools-metaphor? Perhaps the software-as-machine predated tools with an input connected to an output by some conveyer belt about which we say garbage-in-garbage-out.\n\nI recall the origin story of [[grep]] extracted from ed and at home in nascent unix, the metaphorical workbench. I know it it is said of humans that we make tools then our tools make us. How has that played out in modern development?"
