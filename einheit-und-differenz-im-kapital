      "text": "In Capital, then, a reality has emerged from this, which, of course, also remains external to thinking, but is structured in itself exactly as the individual thinks: reflexive and trinitarian. In this way, thinking can abstract from itself without circumstance and project itself into a general analogous to God, which is tantamount to overcoming fear: it short-circuits itself in Capital instead of in God and reaches the same. This subjective integration is then joined by the production of immense wealth in the course of the original accumulation, which has now become possible due to this inner integration: this not least also because the abstract, horizontal version of the Trinity had created the spiritual basis for the discovery of the laws of nature, which, transformed into technology, then also justifiably allowed to speak of capital as a progress in the history of mankind. (I leave aside the dialectic of enlightenment, which was also set along with the discovery of the laws of nature, as well as the immanent proof that the laws of nature actually have the Trinity thought in the abstract version expressed by Abälard as a mental precondition: the first, the dialectic of enlightenment, I can presuppose as known, the second I have elaborated in other places). The ancient philosophers already reflected on the immanent structure of money: but this reflection still took place in a thinking which had to understand itself as standing outside of money. It still lacked the historical basis for a level of abstraction on which laws of nature could first be discovered and generalized as a form of thought, which means: in the form of truth, more precisely: objectivity. With capital, thinking, philosophy in particular, has become immanent to the external, material world - and this is exactly how this thinking, these philosophies look today, i.e. in a time of post-Nazism, in which capital should have survived historically long ago: they are mere variants of Heidegger's philosophy.
