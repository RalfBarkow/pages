I have worked with children of all ages in school settings and in home schooling and other non school groups such as the brownies. There is a big barrier to children pursuing systems intelligence and that is the absence of a qualification. Children are told by their parents and teachers that they must focus on exams if they are to do well in the world. I have tried to get the exam boards to introduce new exams and/or to include ST in their existing syllabi (eg in Geography.) None of my efforts have worked. \n"

A mentoring scheme will be supported by members of systems organisations such as the ORS, ISSS, SDS, INCOSE, ASC, Metaphorum, SCiO, CoR, and Complexity Weekend and will be enabled via a new community platform. This will enable members of these organizations to make a real impact on the world by coaching young people to improve the systems of which they are a part."
