Out of Twilio's 270,000 clients, 0.06 percent might seem trivial, but the company's particular role in the digital ecosystem means that that fractional slice of victims had an outsized value and influence. The secure messaging app Signal, two-factor authentication app Authy, and authentication firm Okta are all Twilio customers that were secondary victims of the breach."
