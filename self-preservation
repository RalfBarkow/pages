      "text": "\"Man lives from nature, i.e. nature is his body, with which he must remain in constant process in order not to die\" – so Karl Marx in the so-called *Ökonomisch-philosophischen Manuskripten* (Economical-Philosophical Manuscripts) of 1844. These famous manuscripts can be read as a paradigm for the fact that radical critique is denied to put a unity in front of the separation of subject and object – be it nature or God, matter or spirit, being or structure. The statement that the physical and spiritual life of man is connected with nature has \"no other sense than that nature is connected with itself, for man is a part of nature\". But at the same time he is not, otherwise the necessity to remain in constant process with it in order to preserve itself would be mute and the \"formation of the 5 senses\" would by no means be that \"work of the whole history of the world up to now\" including \"industry\", as Marx recognizes in the same manuscripts, but merely unconscious process within natural history (perceptible then also only from the absolute consciousness of God, who would therefore also have set it in motion and as which ultimately the theorist himself must feel, as long as he has not gone over to criticism). However, if the senses and with them what they perceive can still be understood at the same time as nature, which is connected with itself, then not money or the form of wealth, as it is then envisaged by the first sentence of *Das Kapital*: It appears as an \"immense collection of commodities\" and the individual commodity in it as its \"elementary form\", which does not occur in nature at all - just as little as the \"abstract labor\", which Marx undertakes to uncover as the \"substance\" of value in it. It is the latter a substance which, in contrast to man, contains \"no atom of natural substance\". But if individuals want to participate in wealth, even if >only< in order not to die, they must remain in constant process with this very substance, while its self-preservation is in turn indispensably bound to a miraculous multiplication of money G-G'.   For value \"constantly passes from one form into the other without losing itself in this movement, and thus transforms itself into an automatic subject,\" it has \"received the occult quality of setting value, because it is value. He casts live young, or at least lays golden eggs.\"\n"

      "text": "With this travesty of self-preservation as reproduction, drawn from the animal kingdom, Marx playfully disregarded the consequences of his insights, which were so unhealthy. Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno highlighted them as all the more oppressive, their Dialectic of Enlightenment already diagnosing the independence that Marx sees through value in a reason that took into account the enforcement of relations of domination long before that of the capital relation. While value does not contain an atom of natural matter from the outset, it almost appears as the business of enlightenment (as a continuation of myth) to educate individuals precisely for this purpose, that is: in the name of self-preservation to repress their own drive nature as well as their connection with extra-human nature to such an extent that domination is not called into question and true reconciliation, which also encompassed the relationship to nature, is thwarted. This \"self-preservation identically held by reason\" is now - and here the dialectic of the Enlightenment comes to the present - in the course of the \"unfolding of capitalism\" under certain conditions, which are, however, only vaguely named (the \"rule of private groups over the economic apparatus\"), no longer separable from \"self-destruction\".\n"

      "text": "To take up the thread of political economy again, the accent is to be placed on the epithets according to which self-preservation in the face of the necessity of life – the ananke, to which even the Greek deities saw themselves subjected – is not held somehow, but identically, culminating in the transcendental sub¬ ject of the critique of pure 'reason. It was Alfred Sohn-Rethel who located money precisely here: the \"cash coin of the a priori\".10 (Even the young Marx called logic the \"money of the spirit.\") Without Adorno and Horkheimer wanting to adopt Sohn-Rethel's basic idea in a de¬ cided way, it nevertheless finds its way into their reflections on the dialectic of enlightenment, namely where they see themselves compelled to exchange the concept of the sub¬ ject for that of the self: Inspired by the Greek term autoc; they thereby express the abstraction from nature in the subject-object relation of the conatus (as Spinoza usually calls the conservatio sui).11 Thus, along with the self, self-preservation also comes under suspicion, and with good reason: It sounds not by chance like self-sufficiency and subsistence - after being reduced to one's own modest means - as the opposite of that formation of the five senses of which Marx had spoken, and of a supposed promise of happiness (supposed it is, because happiness cannot be promised), the mere condition of which - which as such is not to be questioned, quite the contrary13 - is already hypostasized as purpose and goal, for instance according to the motto: Fortunately I can still preserve myself. '4 Precisely this moderation according to conservatio sui has to make itself useful as a constraint on the reproduction of labor power, so that value can lay its golden eggs, that is, for the higher honor of G-G'. As a prerequisite, however, to free oneself from the compulsion of this accumulation, one would therefore have to speak about self-preservation only as about materialism, i.e. negatively - with regard to \"liberation of the spirit from the primacy of material needs in the state of their fulfillment.'s For turned into the positive, its concept immediately sediments, as in a false imperative, also the forms in which the individuals are to live and survive: You must be able to maintain yourself for the sake of your maturity - paraphrase of the infamous >Whoever does not work, shall not eat. Made independent of the individuals and transferred to the nation, it is called autarky and is directed in the crisis against the forms of mediation of capital itself and especially against its most comprehensive: the world market. It - and that means also its other side: the sovereignty of the individual states - into a \"diffuse barbaric multiplicity\" (Adorno16) of geopolitical large spaces and rackets falling over each other, only brings forth the whole potential of annihilation inherent in the capital relation, which the German Volksgemeinschaft should understand as its identity - as the >We annihilate the Jews, and this accompanies all our other thoughts and perpetrators - (in which it also let its auxiliary peoples participate), and in which the Jihad emulates it until today. Thus, in 1946, Horkheimer ended the conversation with Adorno about a possible continuation of the joint work on the Dialectic of Enlightenment with the question: \"To what extent does one have to participate in self-preservation and to what extent is it madness?\"\n Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)"
