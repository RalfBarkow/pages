History is produced whenever the events relevant to society are observed on the basis of the distinction before/after: from antiquity until at least the seventeenth century, the difference before/after was considered as a unity against the background of the temporal horizon itself, and was reflected by distinguishing between passing time and divine eternity. In the modern era, from the eighteenth century onwards, history is grasped as self- referential—it must be continually written anew depending on the historical moment in which the historians find themselves. Also history is, in other words, something historical: history re-appears in history through a →re-entry. Writing history today means recombining data depending on the chosen theoretical approach. Now, the need for data no longer depends on the sources that can be discovered and taken into account, but rather from the theoretical approach itself. From a sociological perspective, it is therefore not so much the coherence of the events to be described historically that is interesting, but rather the consistency of the theoretical approach that the theory of society can deliver.\n"

        "text": "Meaning-constituting systems construct reality as the difference between actuality and potentiality. This difference can be temporalized through the doubling of the distinction. On the potentiality side, we can continue to distinguish between past and future. The present is always secured by the fact that the system reproduces itself autopoietically [→Autopoiesis]: the temporal orientation leads to the distinction between actuality of self-reproduction and what is not actual, i.e. it is not contemporary to the system. In this way, a paradoxical situation is created, in which what is contemporary and what is not contemporary appear at the same time. The paradox is unfolded through particular temporal differences, such as, for instance, the difference between past and future.\nFor each observer [→Operation/Observation], time exists because each dis- tinction has two sides and that, in order to change from one side to the other, operations, and therefore time, are required. Thus, a difference emerges be- tween the observer herself, who is always actual, and the difference between before and after, which is generated\nby the event that enabled the transition from one side to the other side of the distinction. The difference between synchronicity on one side, and the difference before/after on the other side, is time.\nIn the present, non-actual temporal horizons of the past and future are formed. This present moves through time, and with it the horizons move, too: in each moment, past and future are projected anew and there can be no move into the future or return to the past. As horizons, past and future are not quantities constituted from events, but rather selective performances of the system (of the observer). Not everything that happens is relevant to construct the past. This construction also depends on the system and can- not correspond with what “really” happened. The same goes for the future, because the projection of future possibility depends solely on the system.\nThe construction of the temporal dimension is based on the possibility to observe change and duration at the same time. Meaning-constituting sys- tems can only observe events and changes in situations when they can hold something constant that serves as a background. Conversely, everything that remains constant only appears to do so against the background of events.\nThe present can be described in two mutually conditioning ways [→Mean- ing Dimensions]. First, the present is punctual and transforms the future into the past by moving: time passes irreversibly and inevitably. Under the second aspect, the present is observable as the duration that abstracts from the pass- ing of events. The present makes it possible to remember past situations or to anticipate future situations. According to these two temporal points of view, meaning-constituting systems differentiate →structures and →processes, which in their interplay keep meaning accessible to social and psychic operations.\nSince they are imaginary, the horizons of the past and the future are struc- turally determined constructions, which have no correspondences in the en- vironment of the observing system [→System/Environment]: the system and its environment exist only in the present and only synchronically. However, the projection of temporal horizons means that the system can observe changes through constants in terminology without having to change itself. The sys- tem time is not in synch with what happens in its environment, because that would imply the dissolution of the system boundaries.\n"

In the functionally differentiated society, movement is replaced by the idea of the present: the primary temporal horizons become the completed past and the uncertain, open and contingent future into which the system can project numerous possible presents. Selec- tions are guided by the fact that the past is only a premise of the future: it is “capitalized” as the history of already completed selections that can be re- combined depending on future perspectives.\nThis modern conception of time has had consequences for the historical description of society. History is produced whenever the events relevant to so- ciety are observed on the basis of the distinction before/after: from antiquity until at least the seventeenth century, the difference before/after was consid- ered as a unity against the background of the temporal horizon itself, and was reflected by distinguishing between passing time and divine eternity. In the modern era, from the eighteenth century onwards, history is grasped as self- referential—it must be continually written anew depending on the histori- cal moment in which the historians find themselves. Also history is, in other words, something historical: history re-appears in history through a →re-entry. Writing history today means recombining data depending on the chosen the- oretical approach. Now, the need for data no longer depends on the sources that can be discovered and taken into account, but rather from the theoretical approach itself. From a sociological perspective, it is therefore not so much the coherence of the events to be described historically that is interesting, but rather the consistency of the theoretical approach that the theory of society can deliver.\nThe distinction and connection between the past and the future is man- aged in the present by memory, which detects in the past the distinctions providing the frame in which the future can oscillate. Memory has the func- tion of testing the consistency of system operations against its construction of reality, which it accomplishes through the double function of remembering and forgetting. Remembering recognizes repetitions as something already known, overcoming the need to learn the same thing over and over again.
