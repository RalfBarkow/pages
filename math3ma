But we also mentioned that thinking merely algebraically doesn't get us very far. The algebraic perspective, for instance, is not sufficient to describe the passage from probability distributions on corpora of text to syntactic and semantic information in language that wee see in today's large language models. This motivated the category theoretical framework presented in a new paper I shared last time [https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07890]. But even before we bring statistics into the picture, there are some immediate advantages to using tools from category theory rather than algebra. One example comes from elementary considerations of logic, and that's where we'll pick up today. Let's start with a brief recap.

In the next few blog posts &#148; starting today &#148; I'll give a tour of mathematical ideas presented in the paper towards answering the question above.

      "text": "<h3> A Nod to Non-Traditional Applied Math</h3>\n<p>Tue, Jun 29, 2021</p>\n<p>What is applied mathematics? The phrase might bring to mind historical applications of analysis to physical problems, or something similar. I think that's often what folks mean when they say \"applied mathematics.\" And yet there's a much broader sense in which mathematics is applied, especially nowadays. I like what mathematician Tom Leinster once had to say about this: \"I hope mathematicians and other scientists hurry up and realize that theres a glittering array of applications of mathematics in which non-traditional areas of mathematics are applied to non-traditional problems. It does no one any favours to keep using the term 'applied mathematics' in its current overly narrow sense.\" I'm all in favor of rebranding the term \"applied mathematics\" to encompass this wider notion. I certainly enjoy applying non-traditional areas of mathematics to non-traditional problems &#148; it's such a vibrant place to be! It's especially fun to take ideas that mathematicians already know lots about, then repurpose those ideas for potential applications in other domains. In fact, I plan to spend some time sharing one such example with you here on the blog.But before sharing the math&#148; which I'll do in the next couple of blog posts &#148; I want to first motivate the story by telling you about an idea from the field of artificial intelligence (AI)- [https://www.math3ma.com/blog/a-nod-to-non-traditional-applied-math math3ma.com]</p>\n<hr>"

If you'll recall from last time, we saw that the set of truth values $\\{0, 1\\}$ and the unit interval $[0,1]$ and the nonnegative extended reals $[0,\\infty]$ were not just sets but actually preorders and hence categories. We also hinted at the idea that a \"category enriched over\" one of these preorders (whatever that means &#148; we hadn't defined it yet!) looks something like a collection of objects $X,Y,\\ldots$ where there is at most one arrow between any pair $X$ and $Y$, and where that arrow can further be \"decorated with\" &#148;or simply replaced by &#148; a number from one of those three exemplary preorders.With that background in mind, my goal in today's article is to say exactly what a category enriched over a preorder is- [https://www.math3ma.com/blog/warming-up-to-enriched-category-theory-part-2 math3ma.com]</p>\n<hr>"

This article is more on the fun-fact side of things, along with&#148;like most articles here&#148;an eye towards category theory. So here's a fun fact about greatest common divisors and the Fibonacci sequence $F_1,F_2,F_3,\\ldots$, where $F_1=F_2=1$and $F_n:=F_{n-1} +F_{n-2}$ for $n&gt;1$. Namely, for all $n,m\\geq 1$, the greatest common divisor of the $n$th and $m$th Fibonacci numbers is the Fibonacci number whose index is the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $m$....

      "text": "<h3> Limits and Colimits Part 3 (Examples)</h3>\n<p>Tue, Dec 29, 2020</p>\n<p>Once upon a time, we embarked on a mini-series about limits and colimits in category theory.Part 1was a non-technical introduction that highlighted two ways mathematicians often make new mathematical objects from existing ones: bytaking a subcollection of things, or by gluing things together. The first route leads to a construction called a limit, the second to a construction called a colimit.The formal definitions of limits and colimits weregiven inPart 2. There we noted that one speaks of \"the (co)limit of [something].\" As we've seen previously,that \"something\" is a diagram&#148;a functor from an indexing categoryto your category of interest. Moreover, the shape of that indexing category determines the name of the (co)limit: product, coproduct, pullback, pushout, etc. In today's post, I'd like to solidify these ideas by sharing some examples of limits. Next time we'll look at examples of colimits. What's nice is that all of these examples are likely familiar to you&#148;you've seen(co)limits many times before, perhaps without knowing it! The newnessis in viewing them through a categorical lens.&#141;- [https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-3 math3ma.com]</p>\n<hr>"

Last time, we motivated the series by pondering over a thought from classical probability theory, namely that marginal probability doesn't have memory. That is, the process of summing over of a variable in a joint probability distribution causes information about that variable to be lost. But as we saw then, there is a quantum version of marginal probability that behaves much like \"marginal probability with memory.\" It remembers what's destroyed when computing marginals in the usual way. In today's post, I'll unveil the details. Along the way, we'll take an introductory look at the mathematics of quantum probability theory....

This construction often come across as scary and mysterious, but I hope to shine a little light and dispel a little fear. In particular, we won't talk about axioms, universal properties, or commuting diagrams. Instead, we'll take an elementary, concrete look: Given two vectors $\\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$, we can build a new vector, called the tensor product $\\mathbf{v}\\otimes \\mathbf{w}$.

I was so excited. \"This is it!\" I thought, \"now I get to learn how to think like a mathematician.\" You see, for the longest time, my mathematical upbringing was very... not mathematical. As a student in high school and well into college, I was very good at being a robot. Memorize this formula? No problem. Plug in these numbers? You got it. Think critically and deeply about the ideas being conveyed by the mathematics? Nope. It wasn't because I didn't want to think deeply. I just wasn't aware there was anything to think about. I thought math was the art of symbol-manipulation and speedy arithmetic computations. I'm not good at either of those things, and I never understood why people did them anyway. But I was excellent at following directions. So when teachers would say \"Do this computation,\" I would do it, and I would do it well. I just didn't know what I was doing. By the time I signed up for that intro-to-proofs class, though, I was fully aware of the robot-symptoms and their harmful side effects. By then, I knew that math not just fancy hieroglyphics and that even people who aren't super-computers can still be mathematicians because&#148;would you believe it?&#148;\"mathematician\" is not synonymous with \"human calculator.\" There are even&#148;get this&#148;ideas in mathematics, which is something I could relate to. (\"I know how to have ideas,\" I surmised one day, \"so maybe I can do math, too!\") One of my instructors in college was instrumental in helping to rid me of robot-syndrome. One day he told me, \"To fully understand a piece of mathematics, you have to grapple with it. You have to work hard to fully understand every aspect of it.\" Then he pulled out his cell phone, started rotating it about, and said, \"It's like this phone. If you want to understand everything about it, you have to analyze it from all angles. You have to know where each button is, where each ridge is, where each port is. You have to open it up and see how it the circuitry works. You have to study it&#148;really study it&#148;to develop a deep understanding.\" \"And that\" he went on to say, \"is what studying math is like.\"- [https://www.math3ma.com/blog/learning-math math3ma.com]</p>\n<hr>"

To start us off, I posted (a slightly modified version of) the story below on January 23 on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram, so you may have seen this one already. Even so, I thought it'd be a good fit for the blog as well. I have a few more of these quick, soft-topic blurbs that I plan to share throughout the year. So stay tuned!

The information below may come in handy for any topology student who needs to know just the basics (for an exam, say, or even for other less practical (but still mathematically elegant) endeavors) so there won't be any proofs today.
