Bloc is a completely new graphical stack that is not related to the Pharo infrastructure at all. Underneath it relies on [[Skia]], which is the low level graphics support for Firefox and Android. Bloc is vector graphics by design. I am not aware of support for Spec 2, but Bloc offers all sorts of options. As for Roassal3, Bloc is already a visualization engine.
