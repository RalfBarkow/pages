There was also all this stuff Carver Mead was doing with integrated circuits. I just wanted to understand all of this stuffâ€”how circuit design was changing and so on. Then I met Kent who was similarly motivated and every time we did something in Smalltalk we learned something. We had an environment at Tektronix where we could stumble into this. Then we created OOPSLA and felt like we were applying systems and languages. It took a number of years to recruit other people into the discovery of other patterns.
