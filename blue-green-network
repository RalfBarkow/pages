As the report concludes, “The world faces an invisible crisis of water quality. Its impacts are wider, deeper, and more uncertain than previously thought and require urgent attention. While much attention has focused on water quantity — too much water, in the case of floods; too little water, in the case of droughts — water quality has attracted significantly less consideration… Water quality challenges are not unique to developing countries but universal across rich and poor countries alike. High-income status does not confer immunity - challenges with pollutants grow alongside GDP. And as countries develop, the cocktail of chemicals and vectors they contend with change — from fecal bacteria to nitrogen to pharmaceuticals and plastics, for example. What we think of as safe may be far from it.” See also a report by the European Union: “Green infrastructure, as defined by the European Union Green Infrastructure Strategy 2013 is 'a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas with other environmental features designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services’.” https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/greencitytool/resources/docs/guidance/nature.pdf",
