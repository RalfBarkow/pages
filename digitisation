While a humanities scholar can in many cases (but not all) do his or her work in the library of another university (and, as a consequence of the [[digitisation]] of texts, perhaps in any other place in the future), a much more restrictive location constraint arises for the natural and technical scientist in the form of attachment to \"his or her\" laboratory. One can easily see this in the fact that the \"Centres of Advanced Studies\" that are emerging worldwide are predominantly institutions of the humanities and social sciences, because only in these disciplines are the necessary mobilities possible."
