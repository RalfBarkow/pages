Adaptation refers to both a process and its outcome, leading to many interpretations and much debate. The origin of this semantic duality is related to the epistemological rupture that occurred during the 19th century when it collided with the emerging Theory of Evolution and established Creationism. The temporal scale of Evolution is an abstract concept that is outside the realm of immediate human perception, which makes the adaptation debate all the more complex. However, adaptation became a central concept in several major social disciplines, such as psychology, anthropology and geography, as well as in many fields of biology. In each discipline, the environment is strongly linked to the concept of adaptation. Environmental sciences are at the intersection of natural and social sciences and have strong interdisciplinary features as does adaptation. Because of the acceleration of global environmental and socio-economic change, there is a growing interest in adaptation in environmental science. Climate change has become one of the major topics concerned by adaptation since this subject became a priority in research and on the political agenda. However, implementation of adaptation to climate change faces barriers, because of its unclear definition, in particular. The objective of this paper is to contribute to a greater understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of the concept of adaptation in climate change through a comprehensive and interdisciplinary review of the literature.\n"

        "text": "\"Statistical\" is a term applied to adaptations to a given condition or medium, which are numerically frequent, but not necessarily always present, under such conditions. The webbed foot characteristic of aquatic animals, fleshy leaves of plants of desert or seaboard, dwarf plants of mountain tops, are chiefly under hereditary control and statistically numerous, though not universally found, under these given conditions; that is, not all aquatic vertebrates have webbed feet."

The phase of high culture is reached only in few, countable cases with a high degree of individualization. The world society forming today is a single social system. The socio-cultural evolution consequently amounts in the end to *evolution in one case*. The small number, finally the singular number, must therefore be immanently compensable in its disadvantage by meaning. That this was possible for territorial societies of the old style is proven by the symbolic formations which have carried the breakthrough to the bourgeois society and thus to the world society. **For the world society itself, for the critical question of further evolution in one instance, the proof of the possibility is pending.**\n"
