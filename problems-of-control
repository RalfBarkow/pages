We provide a unified framework for the analysis of systems that get information, that incorporate that information in models of their surroundings and that make decisions on the basis of those models. This framework is designed both to support what Simon calls blueprints (descriptions of state) and recipes (prescriptions for action) and to provide for their interaction: in our models, adaptation is the co-adaptation of blueprints and recipes. Systems learn about their environment by attempting to control it and modify their representation of the environment as a function of the results of those attempts at control. These methods are relevant to any system that processes information in order to adapt, including biological systems undergoing natural selection"

In the adaptive control of complex multi-input non-linear systems, physical considerations, such as conservation of energy or entropy increase, represent one of the major tools in building Lyapunov-like functions and providing stability and performance guarantees. In this paper we show that a physically motivated Lyapunov-like function based on the concept of total information can be derived for large classes of non-linear physical systems. We study how this function may be used for designing estimation, adaptation and learning mechanisms for such systems."

By formulating control problems in algorithmic form, we emphasize the importance of computability and computational complexity for issues of control. Generic control problems are shown to be NP-hard: each additional complication, such as the presence of noise or the absence of complete system identification, moves the control problem further up the polynomial hierarchy of computational complexity. In some cases, requirements of ‘optimality’ may be unrealistic or irrelevant, since the solution to the problem of finding the optimal algorithm for control is uncomputable."
