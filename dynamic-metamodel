Journal of Applied Ecology 52, no. 2 (2015): 455–66. https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12378.\n> We constructed a multi-species simulation to investigate the impacts of dingoes on beef cattle enterprises in the Australian rangelands, assuming typical stock management scenarios. Our dynamic metamodel (i.e. an integrated model composed of linked component models; Lacy et al. 2013) represented the important trophic levels and economics of a rangeland cattle-grazing system. We quantified the expected consequences of dingoes on rangeland ecology as well as enterprise performance. Our results indicate that the net influence of functioning dingo populations should be positive, leading to improved native pasture biomass, cattle growth rates and enterprise profits.\n"
