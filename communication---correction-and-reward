There are good and bad times to ask for transitions. Good timing increases our likelihood of success. Poor transitions are often the result of bad timing! We riders must understand how the horse moves in each pace, to feel and know when the time is right. For example, the horse strikes off into canter with the outside hind leg. It makes sense, therefore, to ask for the upwards transition as the outside hind is about to leave the ground. To do this we have to feel the sequence of leg movements through our seat. We can also exploit our external circumstances, for example asking for canter as we enter a corner.",

It makes sense, therefore, to ask for the upwards transition as the outside hind is about to leave the ground. To do this we have to feel the sequence of leg movements through our seat.
