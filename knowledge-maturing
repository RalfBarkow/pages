The project investigates how knowledge maturing takes place in companies, which barriers are encountered, and how sociotechnical solutions overcome those barriers with a particular focus on bottom-up processes. The project is characterised by four strands: the empirical strand conducting different forms of studies, the conceptual-technical strand conceptualising knowledge maturing support and implementing tools, the integration strand developing a flexible infrastructure and enabling loosely coupled solutions, and the evaluation strand which consists of participatory design activities, formative and summative evaluation.\n"

Within the first year of the project, an ethnographically-informed study [14] was conducted to understand real-world maturing practices and activities as well as design studies that explored different approaches to support KM activities. Based on these findings, the project has collaboratively defined use cases that correspond to important KM activities."
