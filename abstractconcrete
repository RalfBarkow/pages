Instead, it seems more reasonable to distinguish between a concrete labour that produces goods and services and equally concrete activities that reproduce and modify power relations. The former involves physical interactions between a group of individuals and a set of external objects. The latter involves power relations between different social groups and, in fact, social theory already has a concept to designate it: class struggle."
