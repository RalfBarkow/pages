The imaginary state is thus to be imagined like a temporal movement from one state of the form through the tunnel into the other state of the form, like a back and forth between two states, which just takes time or actually generates time. The imaginary state is a change of value on a time axis. At any time ti a value of the expression can be determined with the help of the 'principle of dominance'. For the time ti+1 then in the next application step of the principle of dominance another value of the expression is determined, because for expressions with an odd numbered re-entry the value change on the time axis is valid. The process of transmission of states (through the tunnel) on the time axis is illustrated by a mapping of the different intervals of this transmission."

With the distinction, space is generated simultaneously, which is not already there before, but which arises with the distinction and also has no more properties than this. So, in a way, a 'first' space is generated, still without qualities like distance, size, shape, order, up-down, front-rear, right-left. To this first space belong only cohesion (continence) and the possibilities to cross the border into or repeatedly (into-out). Analogous to the 'first space', 'first time' arises together with the oscillation between two states, which is not already there before, but arises with the oscillation and also has no more properties than this. 'First' time is oscillation, still without the quality of duration. Oscillation is described as a process of value change: \"Supposing it is the marked state, then it puts the marked state back into itself, and the marked state within a cross produces the unmarked state outside ... So this rubs itself out and so you get the unmarked state fed back in, and so out comes the marked state again.\" Once this 'cross', which re-enters itself, is created, it runs 'by itself' like the machine work of a clock. But this process has no extension in time, but is to be understood as a \"simultaneous\" \"if it is, it isn't – if it isn't, it is\"."

So, in a way, a 'first' space is generated, still without qualities like distance, size, shape, order, up-down, from-back, right-left. To this first space belong only cohesion (continence) and the possibilities to cross the border into or repeatedly (into-out). Analogous to the 'first space', 'first time' arises together with the oscillation between two states, which is not already there before, but arises with the oscillation and also has no more properties than this. First' time is oscillation, still without the quality of duration. Oscillation is described as a process of value change: \"Supposing it is the marked state, then it puts the marked state back into itself, and the marked state within a cross produces the unmarked state outside ... So this rubs itself out and so you get the unmarked state fed back in, and so out comes the marked state again.\" Once this 'cross', which re-enters itself, is created, it runs 'by itself' like the machine work of a clock. But this process has no extension in time, but is to be understood as a \"simultaneous\" \"if it is, it isn't - if it isn't, it is."
