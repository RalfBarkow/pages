Perhaps that’s why I was intrigued by Vicki’s mention of [[Inquiry-Based Learning]] in the early days of Griffin. I had been experimenting with more ‘Fun Friday’ in my day for a few years at this point, recognising that I was on the verge of becoming stagnant and endeavouring to shun that fate. I just hadn’t quite found the alternate – or realised that I needed to shift my mindset. I fervently knew that I didn’t want to be that teacher that taught the same few year levels for 40 years, regurgitating the same content and teaching in the same way. Not me. "

Was I becoming that ‘always do what I’ve always done’ teacher I had feared? Even though I was dabbling in more learner-centred pedagogy, I still felt a safety, a security in knowing ahead of time the ‘activities’ I would prepare each week and how our unit learning would unfold. I felt prepared and an abundance of pride when colleagues would comment on how organised I was, always planning a fortnight ahead. Being an organised teacher seemed to me to be the ultimate compliment. "

      "text": "Up until this point, learning was detailed, fully mapped out, on my terms, structured to a fault but satisfying to a perfectionist at heart. My planning book was quite the Type A personality spectacle – no space left, no minute not utilised, no time for spontaneity or [[Following Voice]], except for the Fun Friday golden hour. I would teach it, they would learn it; such was my mindset. I held the reins, hesitant to release the responsibility for fear of not getting it all done. Quiet, happy kids re-producing equalled learning, or so I’d been taught."

      "text": "Due to my move to Griffin and the encounters, the reading, the research and the conversations, I soon began to realise that organised didn’t mean ‘good learning’. Order wasn’t as fruitful for learners and learning. Like my precious Fun Friday time, a little bit of chaos and authentic emergence, although terrifying for me at the time, appeared to lead to [[Deeper Learning]] for my learners. I’d actually witnessed it. "

      "text": "In our first year at Griffin, Vicki encouraged us to play with inquiry, to wonder and wander. We were given the permission to experiment, the freedom to tinker was self-paced, void of pressure to get it right. We followed our own curiosity and 'bit off' what we each felt we could manage. Granted permission for learning to be messy in all the right ways, not ‘puppies off the lead’ though, intentional. The go-ahead to [[Fail and Learn]], all with the goal of sparking curiosity and deeper, more long-lasting learning."

      "text": "Armed with Kath Murdoch’s _The Power of Inquiry_, I continued my exploration of play-based learning by harnessing the classroom space as a tool to spark interest, curiosity and investigation. Like my colleagues, I wandered into shifting my WALT (We Are Learning To), to Learning Intentions framed as questions, just as Kath had noted in her book, referencing Guy Claxton and his [[Split Screen Approach]]. This is where the real transformation of my pedagogy began and it really was very uncomfortable. Initially I wondered how I’d ever write the perfect learning intention question but soon realised that perfection mattered very little and that the art of asking a question itself, rather than insisting ‘We Are Learning To’ (WALT), was the linchpin to more meaningful learning that I had needed.

      "text": "Reflecting on the shifts that began to occur in our pedagogy at Griffin during our first year, the phrase ‘wonder and wander’ comes to mind. I wondered more about what the kids were capable of, wandered into uncomfortable pedagogy and found the courage to try something new, I wondered about what might happen if I 'unplanned' more often, wandered into lessons and conversations with less control and more of an organic sequence. Wonder and wander; be curious about learners and learning and how it might happen in a deeper way and with them, rather than to them. "

I experimented relentlessly, following what brought my learners and myself the most joy. I found the courage to step outside my fate and made way for my new and emerging identity. No longer would I do what I had always done, it was time to transform my view of my role as an educator.  It was uncomfortable, but I found safety in being on a collaborative journey. I wandered courageously into the uncomfortable and found delight in what I began to discover. "

        "text": "During my first years at Griffin, I played; I wondered and wandered. Actually, I don’t think I’ve stopped. I experimented relentlessly, following what brought my learners and myself the most joy. I found the courage to step outside my fate and made way for my new and emerging identity. No longer would I do what I had always done, it was time to transform my view of my role as an educator.  It was uncomfortable, but I found safety in being on a collaborative journey. I wandered courageously into the uncomfortable and found delight in what I began to discover. "
