Here is a war to which one can relate without any differentiation - crystal-clearly divided into an infinite number of good guys and the one bad guy. In which it is completely unquestionable who is the perpetrator and who is the victim. Where there are no two opinions, but everything is finally clear. No disunity in the West, no petty party squabbles, no \"yes, but\" journalism, armament first, concerns second, no ambivalence, but rather the almost liberatingly clear decision of where to stand. David against Goliath, brave against treacherous, imperialist against democratic, the dictator against freedom. And, poof, the good old story of proving oneself in war, of devotion to one's country, of fighting to the end, works."

Yet I am as little interested in his psyche as in Putin's, because both personal motives are quite irrelevant to what unfolds: namely, the logic of violence, which is always dynamic and always tends to dissolve. And because language is at the same time the interpretation of reality, the story of good and evil, of right and wrong, of bravery and treachery, provides a direction in which empathy with the victims, especially in the face of the extreme brutality of the attack, becomes ever greater, and with it the willingness to extend support."

Defending oneself is one thing, but if one wants to support Ukraine and at the same time build a new security order, defending oneself is not enough. It can even be counterproductive, because an expansion of the war of aggression into a people's war will take an infinite number of lives and delay the end of the war more and more. And incidentally, because war violence develops its own dynamics, always in the direction of escalation and totalization. Which is why it is best not to fight violence with more violence."

Such a perspective cannot be about \"winning at all costs\" - which, by the way, means having one's actions imposed by the aggressor - but about creating spaces for action that open up possibilities for an end to violence."

And that things must finally be seen in context that we have conveniently sorted into different pigeonholes: Security and dependence, climate change and consumer culture, the social and the ecological question, power and freedom are parts of one and the same context.

Here is a war to which one can relate without any differentiation - crystal-clearly divided into an infinite number of good guys and the one bad guy. In which it is completely unquestionable who is the perpetrator and who is the victim. Where there are no two opinions, but everything is finally clear. No disunity in the West, no petty party squabbles, no \"yes, but\" journalism, armament first, concerns second, no ambivalence, but rather the almost liberatingly clear decision of where to stand. David against Goliath, brave against treacherous, imperialist against democratic, the dictator against freedom. And, poof, the good old story of proving oneself in war, of devotion to one's country, of fighting to the end, works."

Yet I am as little interested in his psyche as in Putin's, because both personal motives are quite irrelevant to what unfolds: namely, the logic of violence, which is always dynamic and always tends to dissolve. And because language is at the same time the interpretation of reality, the story of good and evil, of right and wrong, of bravery and treachery, provides a direction in which empathy with the victims, especially in the face of the extreme brutality of the attack, becomes ever greater, and with it the willingness to extend support."

Defending oneself is one thing, but if one wants to support Ukraine and at the same time build a new security order, defending oneself is not enough. It can even be counterproductive, because an expansion of the war of aggression into a people's war will take an infinite number of lives and delay the end of the war more and more. And incidentally, because war violence develops its own dynamics, always in the direction of escalation and totalization. Which is why it is best not to fight violence with more violence."

Such a perspective cannot be about \"winning at all costs\" - which, by the way, means having one's actions imposed by the aggressor - but about creating spaces for action that open up possibilities for an end to violence."

And that things must finally be seen in context that we have conveniently sorted into different pigeonholes: Security and dependence, climate change and consumer culture, the social and the ecological question, power and freedom are parts of one and the same context. And that is exactly why the story of good and evil is wrong."
