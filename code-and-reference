The starting point for this is that Luhmann has brought the time factor much more into play since the autopoietic turn. According to this, social systems exist only in time, namely from a multiplicity of events of the same kind, which appear and disappear again from one moment to the next. Therefore, the question arises how a social system manages to establish itself in view of this eventfulness of its existence and to create duration in the timeline. Or in other words: How does a social system manage to maintain its identity from event to event? Because if it does not succeed, after the disappearance of the just present event, to produce immediately a new one, which takes up and continues the already spun 'system thread' again, the system disintegrates immediately and ceases to exist."

The clearest case for operational closure is society as a system with communication as the operational form belonging only to it. For society, according to Luhmann, consists only of communications. Other events, which also occur, constantly and everywhere, cannot become part of society, but remain mere noise, which can at best be expressed through the irritation of at least one consciousness of the persons involved in society. The difference that is decisive for the formation of society as a system is observable communication behavior, i.e. the difference of information and utterance, which must be observed as a difference in order to set communication as an operation in motion, and this again in difference to all the other events to which such a difference of information and utterance cannot be attributed. In other words, the constitution of communication as an operation is about the simple possibility of the imputability of certain features to certain events, as far as these are suitable to be able to impute exactly this difference of information and utterance to them."

In a second step, the coding government/opposition was added, which Luhmann brought into the conversation in the 1980s in order to finally replace the left/right distinction altogether in its function as the guiding difference of the political system, thus completing the autonomy of the political system in the name of democracy (Luhmann 1986; 1989). \"What we call 'democracy' and trace back to the institution of political elections is thus nothing other than the completion of the differentiation of a political system.

      "text": "The special feature of the political coding government/opposition, which occupies the (split) apex of the political system, is its evolutionarily unique performance. For while the government and its subordinate political administration continue to perform the function of collectively binding decision-making, the opposition functions as a \"buffer zone between the government and the people\" (164) and thus achieves a disproportionately higher degree of inclusion of the political periphery than was ever possible before. In a sense, the opposition ensures a reduction and mediation of the power imbalance that exists between the center and the periphery of politics. Moreover, the sheer possibility of integration into political procedures contributes significantly to the legitimacy of the political system, as Luhmann showed as early as 1969. Formally logically, this is because every concern that is to be decided politically should be attributed either to the government or to the opposition as the competent address. For what is not considered by the government automatically ends up with the opposition, and vice versa. This is an inevitable consequence of binary coding. Moreover, the binary coding government/opposition causes the operational closure of the political system. The assumption is thus that the elementary operation of the political system can be seen in any communication that addresses any concern, provided that this is done with reference to the government/opposition distinction, while all other forms of communication that cannot be shown to have such a reference belong to the internal social environment of the political system."

For public opinion has the essential task of reducing complexity in the mediation of politics and the internal social environment – otherwise the political system would not be able to fulfill its function. On top of that, social movements and political parties support this process of selection and rationalization (Luhmann 1993; P)."

        "text": "The special feature of the political coding government/opposition, which occupies the (split) apex of the political system, is its evolutionarily unique performance. For while the government and its subordinate political administration continue to perform the function of collectively binding decision-making, the opposition functions as a \"buffer zone between the government and the people\" (164) and thus achieves a disproportionately higher degree of inclusion of the political periphery than was ever possible before. In a sense, the opposition ensures a reduction and mediation of the power imbalance that exists between the center and the periphery of politics. Moreover, the sheer possibility of integration into political procedures contributes significantly to the legitimacy of the political system, as Luhmann showed as early as 1969. Formally logically, this is because every concern that is to be decided politically should be attributed either to the government or to the opposition as the competent address. For what is not considered by the government automatically ends up with the opposition, and vice versa. This is an inevitable consequence of binary coding. Moreover, the binary coding government/opposition causes the operational closure of the political system. The assumption is thus that the elementary operation of the political system can be seen in any communication that addresses any concern, provided that this is done with reference to the government/opposition distinction, while all other forms of communication that cannot be shown to have such a reference belong to the internal social environment of the political system."
