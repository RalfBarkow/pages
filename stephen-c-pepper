Pepper.\n\n> Pepper's work is difficult to summarize as he worked in many fields, but he made special contributions to three areas:  metaphysics, general value theory, and aethetics.  For Pepper, it all begins with metaphysics.  He though of metaphysical systems as being somewhat like scientific hypothese, but unlimited in scope. [p. 756]\n"

He was heavily influenced by the chair of the department, Jacob Loewenberg, a specialist in aesthetics and Kant. Under their joint leadership in 1930, the department established the Philosophical Union.
