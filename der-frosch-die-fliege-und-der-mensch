Maturana had studied medicine there since 1948 before going to Harvard University for doctoral studies in 1956, researching questions of frog anatomy and vision. Among other things, he found that after certain interventions in its nervous system, the frog stubbornly threw its tongue in one direction when trying to catch a fly, while the fly was to be found in the other. It is not the fly, he concluded, but the brain that coordinates the frog's perceptions and movements. In 1960, he accepted a call to the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Santiago de Chile and expanded his research into a theory of the organism, perception and cognition. In 1968, [[Heinz von Foerster]] invited him to the University of Illinois, where he held a visiting professorship until 1970."

Operational closure was the keyword of the hour. At last we understood what the neurophysiology of a Johannes Müller, Gustav Theodor Fechner and Hermann von Helmholtz had already suspected in the 19th century, without being able to face this idea. The nervous system consists of nothing but its impulses. It must construct the abundance of figures, colors, sounds, sensations and ideas that occupy consciousness from these impulses and nothing else but these impulses. The organism is open to this world because it works closed on itself. Inconceivable. The neurosciences are not yet up to this thought today."

He feared that Luhmann was again subjecting the individual human being to the very social forces against which Maturana and Varela had developed their concept. The fact that Luhmann took the idea of freedom seriously and also used it to describe families, organizations, and functional systems, not to mention society itself, was impossible to convey to Maturana. The attempt to discuss this with him in Bielefeld was quickly abandoned. Luhmann and Maturana were supposed to organize the seminar together that winter of 1986. But Luhmann quickly realized that Maturana's strengths did not lie in discussion. As early as the second session, he moved his chair to the edge of the room, left the podium to Maturana, and followed with fascination the lecture of a scientist who was able to devote an entire scholarly life to one of the most improbable thoughts one can think."

One of these questions concerns Luhmann's proposal to temporalize the notion of the component of autopoietic systems. It is *events* that self-referentially differentiate and reproduce autopoietic systems. Events appear and disappear. They have a punctually stable but fleeting existence. In this form they reproduce the [[Problem]] they solve. They are a connecting event in search of connecting events. In sociology, this is immediately obvious. Both action and communication can only be thought in this temporalized sense. Any structure beyond this is an expectation that certain events will or will not occur. \n"

This implies a temporal understanding of operation, even though von Foerster does not make this explicit. Possibly this is easier to think of in physics than in biology. Electronic impulses have per se an ephemeral identity. How would this idea work in the description of neuronal systems, immune systems, organisms? "

Luhmann did not address the concept of network. In the 1980s, when Luhmann was formulating his theory of social systems, this was not surprising. The concept of the network hardly played a role in sociology. At best, it described certain group dynamics in which systems theory had little interest. \n"

White]]'s network theories, sociology has developed a body of theory that can compete with that of systems theory. Networks are structures that have exactly the same value of describing uncertain expectations that Luhmann formulated for his concept of structure. One could have considerably improved both the empirical scope and, relatedly, the analytical acuity of systems theory if one had early on incorporated a network concept that, entirely in the sense of Maturana, allowed one to describe the structures, as concrete as they are exchangeable, in which the autopoiesis of the basal operations of social systems, which empirically always remains somewhat abstract, takes place."

Luhmann has pointed out that autopoiesis is to be understood as production in precisely that sense in which any production, outside of technical contexts, always has to do with the combination of available and unavailable factors of production. In sociology, this refers to knowledge and non-knowledge, both of which underlie all communication, since otherwise there would be no occasion for communication. But what does \"production\" mean here? The autopoiesis of social systems enables itself, as Luhmann says, from behind. It is a fundamentally retrospective production."

Do they thus produce that minimal complication of a description that does not reproduce the system one-to-one, which John von Neumann (*Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata*, Urbana, IL, 1966) already described as an elementary condition of an intelligent, because creative reproduction?"

Maturana answered the question of what life is. The question of what cognition is, however, never left him. This amounted to a theory of the observer, about which he once planned to write a book together with von Foerster. This book never came about. Only the title was apparently fixed: \"Autopoiesis of Autopoiesis\". Maturana died in Santiago de Chile on May 6, 2021."

It must construct the abundance of figures, colors, sounds, sensations and ideas that occupy consciousness from these impulses and nothing else but these impulses. The organism is open to this world because it works closed on itself. Inconceivable. The neurosciences are not yet up to this thought today."

        "text": "When Luhmann began to test the idea of autopoiesis on social systems in the 1980s, Maturana felt misunderstood. He feared that Luhmann was again subjecting the individual human being to the very social forces against which Maturana and Varela had developed their concept. The fact that Luhmann took the idea of freedom seriously and also used it to describe families, organizations, and functional systems, not to mention society itself, was impossible to convey to Maturana. The attempt to discuss this with him in Bielefeld was quickly abandoned. Luhmann and Maturana were supposed to organize the seminar together that winter of 1986. But Luhmann quickly realized that Maturana's strengths did not lie in discussion. As early as the second session, he moved his chair to the edge of the room, left the podium to Maturana, and followed with fascination the lecture of a scientist who was able to devote an entire scholarly life to one of the most improbable thoughts one can think."

Auf den Begriff des Netzwerks ging Luhmann nicht ein. In den 1980er Jahren, als Luhmann seine Theorie sozialer Systeme ausformulierte, war das nicht weiter verwunderlich. Der Begriff des Netzwerks spielte in der Soziologie kaum eine Rolle. Allenfalls beschrieb er bestimmte Gruppendynamiken, an denen die Systemtheorie kaum ein Interesse hatte. Aus der Sicht der 1990er Jahre und der Gegenwart muss man diese Auslassung jedoch bedauern. Mit Bruno Latours und vor allem mit Harrison C. Whites Netzwerktheorien hat sich in der Soziologie ein Theorieangebot entwickelt, das mit dem der Systemtheorie konkurrieren kann. Netzwerke sind Strukturen, die exakt jenen Wert der Beschreibung ungewisser Erwartungen haben, den Luhmann für seinen Strukturbegriff formuliert hat. Man hätte sowohl die empirische Reichweite als auch, damit zusammenhängend, die analytische Schärfe der Systemtheorie erheblich verbessern können, wenn man frühzeitig einen Netzwerkbegriff eingebaut hätte, der ganz im Sinne Maturanas die ebenso konkreten wie austauschbaren Strukturen zu beschreiben erlaubt, in denen sich die empirisch immer etwas abstrakt bleibende Autopoiesis der basalen Operationen sozialer Systeme abspielt."

Luhmann did not address the concept of network. In the 1980s, when Luhmann was formulating his theory of social systems, this was not surprising. The concept of the network hardly played a role in sociology. At best, it described certain group dynamics in which systems theory had little interest. From the perspective of the 1990s and the present, however, one must regret this omission. With Bruno Latour's and especially Harrison C. White's network theories, sociology has developed a body of theory that can compete with that of systems theory. Networks are structures that have exactly the same value of describing uncertain expectations that Luhmann formulated for his concept of structure. One could have considerably improved both the empirical scope and, relatedly, the analytical acuity of systems theory if one had early on incorporated a network concept that, entirely in the sense of Maturana, allowed one to describe the structures, as concrete as they are exchangeable, in which the autopoiesis of the basal operations of social systems, which empirically always remains somewhat abstract, takes place."

Luhmann has pointed out that autopoiesis is to be understood as production in precisely that sense in which any production, outside of technical contexts, always has to do with the combination of available and unavailable factors of production. In sociology, this refers to knowledge and non-knowledge, both of which underlie all communication, since otherwise there would be no occasion for communication. But what does \"production\" mean here? The autopoiesis of social systems enables itself, as Luhmann says, from behind. It is a fundamentally retrospective production."

However, this should not prevent us from still seeing the great impulse of Maturana and Varela as a promising construction site even half a century after its formulation."

Maturana answered the question of what life is. The question of what cognition is, however, never left him. This amounted to a theory of the observer, about which he once planned to write a book together with von Foerster. This book never came about. Only the title was apparently fixed: \"Autopoiesis of Autopoiesis\". Maturana died in Santiago de Chile on May 6, 2021."

One of these questions concerns Luhmann's proposal to temporalize the notion of the component of autopoietic systems. It is *events* that self-referentially differentiate and reproduce autopoietic systems. Events appear and disappear. They have a punctually stable but fleeting existence. In this form they reproduce the [[problem]] they solve. They are a connecting event in search of connecting events. In sociology, this is immediately obvious. Both action and communication can only be thought in this temporalized sense. Any structure beyond this is an expectation that certain events will or will not occur. This idea is compatible with von Foerster's concept of operational closure: operationally closed systems are subject to the condition – their only condition – that every end is also a beginning. This implies a temporal understanding of operation, even though von Foerster does not make this explicit. Possibly this is easier to think of in physics than in biology. Electronic impulses have per se an ephemeral identity. How would this idea work in the description of neuronal systems, immune systems, organisms? "

The concept of the network hardly played a role in sociology. At best, it described certain group dynamics in which systems theory had little interest. \n"

Maturana did not know the answer. He devoted his semester break to the question and found the answer in his concept of autopoiesis. Autopoiesis, self-generation, is understood as a process that extracts from the components of a living being, primarily cells and proteins, not only the components of the living being but also the network of generation of the components of the living being. [[Life]] is an unfolded tautology. It is a one-time invention that has been repeated in an infinite number of forms since life existed on Earth. Life, so the consequence from this consideration, cannot be explained from its origin, but only from its continuation. One can speculate about the processes that preceded the emergence of life from the primordial soup, but the crucial point is not its emergence but its reproduction. Life is its own (\"autos\") work (\"poiesis\")."

In this form they reproduce the [[Problem]] they solve. They are a connecting event in search of connecting events. In sociology, this is immediately obvious. Both action and communication can only be thought in this temporalized sense. Any structure beyond this is an expectation that certain events will or will not occur. This idea is compatible with von Foerster's concept of operational closure: operationally closed systems are subject to the condition – their only condition – that every end is also a beginning. This implies a temporal understanding of operation, even though von Foerster does not make this explicit. Possibly this is easier to think of in physics than in biology. Electronic impulses have per se an ephemeral identity. How would this idea work in the description of neuronal systems, immune systems, organisms? "

        "text": "This idea is compatible with von Foerster's concept of operational closure: operationally closed systems are subject to the condition – their only condition – that every end is also a beginning. This implies a temporal understanding of operation, even though von Foerster does not make this explicit. Possibly this is easier to think of in physics than in biology. Electronic impulses have per se an ephemeral identity. How would this idea work in the description of neuronal systems, immune systems, organisms? "

        "text": "From the perspective of the 1990s and the present, however, one must regret this omission. With [[Bruno Latour]]'s and especially [[Harrison C. White]]'s network theories, sociology has developed a body of theory that can compete with that of systems theory. Networks are structures that have exactly the same value of describing uncertain expectations that Luhmann formulated for his concept of structure. One could have considerably improved both the empirical scope and, relatedly, the analytical acuity of systems theory if one had early on incorporated a network concept that, entirely in the sense of Maturana, allowed one to describe the structures, as concrete as they are exchangeable, in which the autopoiesis of the basal operations of social systems, which empirically always remains somewhat abstract, takes place."
