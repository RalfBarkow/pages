If [[Design By Contract]] Pre and Post conditions were compeate they would have the same expressive power as unit tests, and our preference for one of the other would be less critical-- It should be possible to translate each unit test into a pre and post condition and conversely automatically. I therefore do not make a hard distinction between them and will use both. I think [[Design By Contract]] will prove to be a more useful notion over time becuase it may yet be possible, someday, to test the pre and postconditions themselves for compleateness, but for now I am content to consider either acceptable. I do not think we should see them as orthaganol concepts however, but different methods of expressing the same idea. -- [[Marc Grundfest]]",

Similarly, code refactoring is a clever way to get them to do analysis. It's like orange flavored Tylenol.

I'm not sure how you'd really measure this - are there any commercial or widely deployed, public applications developed with XP that you can check defect rates from version to version?
