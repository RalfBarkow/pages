        "text": "We should not conceive of “process” as a simple succession of one event after another. Instead, it is the organization of these events into sequences, so that selections that have already been realized and selections that are expected together provide the conditions for a selection realized in a particular moment. The form of the process establishes the limit of possibilities, which allows the determination of connections that are found by each event in each situation. In other words, this limitation forms a reference horizon for communication possibilities (in social systems) or thought possibilities (in psychic systems).\n"
