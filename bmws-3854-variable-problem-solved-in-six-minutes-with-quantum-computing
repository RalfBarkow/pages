(QCI) solved a 3,854-variable optimization problem for German automaker BMW in six minutes, using its Entropy Quantum Computing (EQC) solution to determine the ideal placement of vehicle sensors in BMW's Vehicle Sensor Placement Challenge 2022. EQC factors the changing environment into its calculations, saving time and expense by not having to control for all variables outside the Quantum Processing Unit. Said QCI's Bob Liscouski, &quot;We believe that this proves that innovative quantum computing technologies can solve real business problems today.&quot;"
