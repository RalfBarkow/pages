        "text": "This article proposes that systems theory should understand its handling of these graphs of forms as diagrammatic practice in the context of the distinction between symbolization/formalization (Carnap 1968). In other words, these form-figures should not be understood as formalisms, i.e. as perspectives on an as yet unwritten formal calculus of the social, but – contrary to the self-description of this practice (Baecker 2005, 11 f.) – as symbolizing diagrams."

        "text": "The article explores the impression that the use of form figures may be more loosely tied to mathematics than is generally assumed or claimed and argues that this use should not be interpreted as \"applications\" of the formal calculus of the Laws of Form, but rather as \"analogies\" that have been put into operation. In addition to the heuristic value of such figure designs, further advantages of such \"operative imagery\" (Krämer 2009) are elaborated: It offers the possibility to abandon some theoretical trajectories of a spatial metaphoric, as, according to the thesis, becomes operationally effective in the common interpretation of the concept of the \"two-sided form\"."
