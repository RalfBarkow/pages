It suggests that particles undergo these processes sequentially or interchangeably, highlighting the dynamic nature of their movement. This formulation may be preferable if you want to emphasize the dual nature of particle movement and the importance of both expansion and contraction in the process.\n\n2. **\"Particles move through expansion and contraction\"**: This formulation presents expansion and contraction as a unified process or mechanism of movement. It suggests that particles move through a single process that encompasses both expansion and contraction, rather than treating them as separate or sequential actions. This formulation may be preferable if you want to emphasize the cohesive and interconnected nature of particle movement.\n\nUltimately, the choice between the two formulations depends on the specific context and emphasis of your message. If you want to highlight the individual processes of expansion and contraction, the first formulation may be more suitable.
