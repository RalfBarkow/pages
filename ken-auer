Since the early days of my time at KSC, [[Sam Adams]] and I were big proponents of not accessing instance variables directly.  [[Ward And Kent]] always argued with us about it.  So, in 1994, I saw patterns as a means to put down on paper exactly why I was right, and [[Ward And Kent]] were wrong.  At the second [[Hillside Group]] meeting, I worked with [[Richard Helm]] and [[Bruce Anderson]] to discuss how the different pieces of my coding philosophy would fit together to solve all the forces I felt it solved.  It was a neat exercise in pulling patterns out of ones head and into a \"mostly ordered\" group of patterns that together generated something much bigger.  The current result of this is in the PLoP'94 proceedings, Chapter 27, \"Reusability through [[Self Encapsulation]]\".  (By the way, I still haven't converted [[Ward And Kent]], but they at least appreciate the benefits and I've even heard [[Kent Beck]] promoting the patterns at times, although he may not admit it publicly)... I approach Java a bit differently for a variety of reasons.  As soon as I figure out and find the time to articulate them, I may produce related patterns there.",

One of my favorite sayings is based on something [[Kent Beck]] said at one of the [[Hillside Group]] gatherings, \"We're either going to do stuff, or talk about stuff, but we don't want to start talking ABOUT ABOUT stuff!\".  My pet peeve is methodologists or high-level consultants who draw pretty pictures that simplify what needs to be done and then say something like \"the rest is just an implementation detail\".  Implementation details and what some would call low-level design is what I focus on (although I realize the higher level stuff is necessary and valuable... it's just not very valuable if it doesn't result in something that runs).  I'm skeptical of people who want to avoid \"low-level design\" because I fear that they really don't know enough to realize the implications their high-level design has on the \"stuff\" that actually has to get done.

As one person put it when we were talking about our corporate values, \"We believe everyone has a life outside of work or should get one.\"  This never kept us from aspiring to do (and accomplishing) great things... in fact it did quite the contrary.  At the time I left (and several years before) that had changed.  The demise of KSC (at least my analysis of it) is something that I'd rather leave off the net.  I will say that in order to stay and be appreciated by those in power I felt I would have had to work long hours and fly all over the country as a high-paid individual working the politics, mostly on projects I wouldn't have chosen as good business in the first place... maybe I was wrong in thinking that, but that's water under the bridge.

Since the early days of my time at KSC, [[Sam Adams]] and I were big proponents of not accessing instance variables directly.  [[Ward And Kent]] always argued with us about it.  So, in 1994, I saw patterns as a means to put down on paper exactly why I was right, and [[Ward And Kent]] were wrong.  At the second [[Hillside Group]] meeting, I worked with [[Richard Helm]] and [[Bruce Anderson]] to discuss how the different pieces of my coding philosophy would fit together to solve all the forces I felt it solved.  It was a neat exercise in pulling patterns out of ones head and into a \"mostly ordered\" group of patterns that together generated something much bigger.  The current result of this is in the PLoP'94 proceedings, Chapter 27, \"Reusability through [[Self Encapsulation]]\".

One of my favorite sayings is based on something [[Kent Beck]] said at one of the [[Hillside Group]] gatherings, \"We're either going to do stuff, or talk about stuff, but we don't want to start talking ABOUT ABOUT stuff!\".  My pet peeve is methodologists or high-level consultants who draw pretty pictures that simplify what needs to be done and then say something like \"the rest is just an implementation detail\".  Implementation details and what some would call low-level design is what I focus on (although I realize the higher level stuff is necessary and valuable... it's just not very valuable if it doesn't result in something that runs).  I'm skeptical of people who want to avoid \"low-level design\" because I fear that they really don't know enough to realize the implications their high-level design has on the \"stuff\" that actually has to get done.

As one person put it when we were talking about our corporate values, \"We believe everyone has a life outside of work or should get one.\"  This never kept us from aspiring to do (and accomplishing) great things... in fact it did quite the contrary.  At the time I left (and several years before) that had changed.  The demise of KSC (at least my analysis of it) is something that I'd rather leave off the net.

But it's not the best way to build great software no matter how good a developer you are and it doesn't do much for the life-on-life angle.  I've found that very few people who have telecommuted for extended periods of time, and value the benefits of being a part of a productive team, find telecommuting being a big issue to them later (they'd rather work in a good team environment).  Although having the option of working at home every once in a while, or for a few hours at a time is almost always desirable... I already offer that to my employees, and plan on continuing to offer that.  Once someone is part of the team, there is very little question as to when it makes sense and when it does not.  Until they are part of the team, there is very little reason to encourage telecommuting.  How long it takes for them to really be part of the team will depend on the team and the individual.  Nathaniel originally desired to spend more time at home, and I insisted he came here to which he submitted.  Now he works at home every once in a while and it's not an issue.  There are very few tasks which he should be doing by himself and he knows it.  When they come up, he simply tells me that he thinks he'll just stay home for a day or half-day and does it.",
