The required SIL of the SF depends on the quantity of the risk associated with the failure of this one SF. The SIL against random failure can be expressed through the dangerous failure rate of the SF for an electronic safety-related control system (ESRCS) operating in a continuous mode of operation. The proof must be provided (among other things) that the SIL requirements for the individual SFs are met so the ESRCS can be accepted and implemented. The assessment of the impact of random failures on the SIL of the SF must be performed using the quantitative analysis method. This paper describes the procedure and derives equations for evaluating the impact of random failure on SIL of the SF using Markov chains with two absorption states. The achieved results are presented for SF implemented by ESRCS with dual architecture based on composite fail-safety technique."

Thus, on a global scale, the public health crisis has been converted into various spectacles of ostensible border “crisis.” Rather than seeing borders as purely a matter of control, however, it is instructive to situate the tactics of border enforcement in relation to the primacy, autonomy, and subjectivity of human mobility. If we start from the human freedom of movement and recognize border enforcement as a reaction formation, various tactics of border policing can be seen to introduce interruptions that temporarily decelerate cross-border mobilities. Compelled to revert to a kind of “standby” mode, migrants are temporarily immobilized and must find ways to convert their waiting from “dead time” into more or less productive time. Waiting to be re-activated, their mobilities remain an intractable and always potentially disruptive constitutive power."

Thus, on a global scale, the public health crisis has been converted into various spectacles of ostensible border “crisis.” Rather than seeing borders as purely a matter of control, however, it is instructive to situate the tactics of border enforcement in relation to the primacy, autonomy, and subjectivity of human mobility. If we start from the human freedom of movement and recognize border enforcement as a reaction formation, various tactics of border policing can be seen to introduce interruptions that temporarily decelerate cross-border mobilities. Compelled to revert to a kind of “standby” mode, migrants are temporarily immobilized and must find ways to convert their waiting from “dead time” into more or less productive time. Waiting to be re-activated, their mobilities remain an intractable and always potentially disruptive constitutive power."

        "text": "> Forms of containment to combat disease can be identified in the histories of many cities however, including the individualized home-quarantines imposed in London during the bubonic plague (or Great Plague of 1665–1666), the development of colonies for excluded lepers worldwide, and the developments of remote tuberculosis sanitoria in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In turn, strategies of spatial distancing, as Legg argues, can be evidenced in the planning history of colonial cities such as Delhi, where the British regime set out to construct a new capital to the south of the existing city or, indeed, in the isolation of lepers from cities.8 As Foucault argues, strategies involving the rejection or exclusion of people from cities or the imposition of controls upon the movements of entire populations included within cities are two key ways in which power has historically been exerted in related to public health threats, with leprosy and plague emblematic respectively of each approach."
