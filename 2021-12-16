Sie können die Sprachen, die Sie für Ihre FE-Entwicklungsabläufe verwenden, derzeit nicht kontrollieren, aber Sie haben vielleicht mehr Freiheit bei der Sprache, die Sie verwenden, um Tools zu erstellen, die vielleicht keine aktuelle Parallele haben, die Ihnen (und eventuell Ihren Teamkollegen) Kopfzerbrechen bereiten."

I've used mondrian to visualize calling graphs across yaml.\n- Software Assessment\n     - Help you answer questions like are we not being DRY, should I centralize/modularize a certain React component, such analysis is even better if done across repos\n     - Should i split this monolith? What would be the best way?\n     - Create custom logic & custom Gt views on top of Moose/Famix that understands, for example route logic in node.js Express web server\n- Build something that competes with Insomnia/Postman for prototyping around REST apis. Being able to navigate/query JSON responses as live objects, as opposed to dead text makes Gt as is already pretty good at working with JSON data. It could be better, but it's better than with text (in my opinion)\n- While developing locally, log heavily and structurally and use Gt to parse logs and potentially build better stories of the internal state of programs that you could do with the native Js tools that ecosystem provides (edit: forgot you can now interact with JS debugger from Gt, haven't tried it myself, but that may be the first thing on your list to try.) \nYou can do a lot of stuff 'around' your existing code with Gt"

Going for patchworks means accepting more fragile systems in exchange for moving on faster. I hope that one day we will have \"patchwork refactoring tools\" for turning prototype patchworks into more robust systems. And maybe GT will be part of that."
