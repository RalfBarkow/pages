Among its prominent features are an advanced graphical user interface, ideal for interactive analysis, an interpreter for the C++ programming language, for rapid and efficient prototyping and a persistence mechanism for C++ objects, used also to write every year petabytes of data recorded by the Large Hadron Collider experiments. This introductory guide illustrates the main features of ROOT which are re"
