It is at this point that Spencer Brown provides the crucial insight. Spencer Brown summarizes two different functions in one operator, namely distinction and indication. A distinction as such is incomplete, operatively imperfect, if it does not at the same time designate the one side that is being distinguished. Accordingly, designating has [[Meaning]] only within the framework of a distinction, while the latter can only have the sense of preparing a designation. "

The asymmetry is then expressed in the two fundamental axioms (and further ones are not necessary). The repetition of the operation condenses the signified, but adds nothing (The value of the call made again is the value of the call). The opposite is true for the repetition of the crossing (The value of the crossing made again is not the value of the crossing). The result is an enrichment of form, a reflection on the basis of the boundary, and finally a re-entry of the distinction into the space in which it distinguishes something."

Once it is set, it cannot be erased again, because there is no operation of its own available for it. There is no way back to the \"unmarked space\". The beginning is fatal. If one wants to change something, then only with operations that always already perform distinctions and designations, separations and asymmetrisations in one. That is why also the consequential problems in the system structure occur temporalized. For example, there is no simultaneous yes and no, i.e. no contradictions, but only an oscillation between both possibilities, which may appear as a contradiction to an observer who abstracts from time relations in the system. So the question, with which distinction (e.g. that of man and woman?) one starts, is rationally undecidable, but momentous."

Nevertheless, an observer can distinguish distinctions, for example, according to whether they construct a universe with the help of the additional axiom of the excluded third or whether they function as mere duals. The former possibilities could also be called totalizing distinctions. Classical (nowadays disputed) logic is perhaps the most famous case. It has led to paradoxes which had to be excluded; and finally to a \"re-entry\" of the distinction into that which is distinguished by it, so that one accepts as true only what is \"true and not untrue\".

They do not result from the thing itself, in the case of men and women, for example, not from a basic anthropological fact. They are constructions of a reality that could also be constructed in a completely different way, starting from completely different distinctions. This does not exclude that their use (as an observer can see) is motivated and can be justified; and of course \"postrationalizations\" (Glanville 1984) remain possible at any time. Therefore, the initial instruction is rightly: make a distinction (otherwise nothing works). But is this already the trap? And should one consequently advise women: make no distinction?"

      "text": "Finally, it should be noted that connectable distinctions require an asymmetrization (however minimal, however reversible). The one (and not the other) side is designated. It is obvious that the distinction would be at the same time beginning and end of operating, if it did not carry a designation with it. One would then have no clue on which side the operation could be continued (and be it as crossing). The machine would stop. As in Aristotelian physics the equilibrium is a deficient state, because it prevents the movement to seek its natural place, so the pure distinction is inconclusive. True, one might object that the choice of designation could be left to the situation – sometimes the man, sometimes the woman according to a fair equality, and so on. But this would be a fallacy at this level of theory construction; for then the order of situations would be superior to logic, it would dominate the operations, one would in fact have a hierarchy in which the operation only carries out what the situation demands (and as a sociologist one could add: one knows that this correlates with power relations, stratification, etc.)."

      "text": "So not like that! Apparently there are reasons not to handle distinctions completely side-neutral, but to mark them by a slight preference for one side. One thinks of famous cases like: subject/object, figure/ground, sign/designated, text/context, system/environment, master/servant. This does not deny that each side has meaning only in relation to the other, nor that a transition from one to the other is possible at any time. But it must be prevented that the operation gets stuck in an undecidability like Buridan's donkey between the haystacks; and it must also be prevented that the situation alone indicates the way out and thus overrides the structure, because then no more expectations can be formed. So it could have its justified reason to build a slight asymmetrization as a perfection feature into the basic operation. We suppose: already in it is the decision of this logic for the man. But is it to be avoided?"

If one wants to change something, then only with operations that always already perform distinctions and designations, separations and asymmetrisations in one. That is why also the consequential problems in the system structure occur temporalized. For example, there is no simultaneous yes and no, i.e. no contradictions, but only an oscillation between both possibilities, which may appear as a contradiction to an observer who abstracts from time relations in the system. So the question, with which distinction (e.g. that of man and woman?) one starts, is rationally undecidable, but momentous."

One thinks of famous cases like: subject/object, figure/ground, sign/designated, text/context, system/environment, master/servant. This does not deny that each side has meaning only in relation to the other, nor that a transition from one to the other is possible at any time. But it must be prevented that the operation gets stuck in an undecidability like Buridan's donkey between the haystacks; and it must also be prevented that the situation alone indicates the way out and thus overrides the structure, because then no more expectations can be formed. So it could have its justified reason to build a slight asymmetrization as a perfection feature into the basic operation. We suppose: already in it is the decision of this logic for the man.
