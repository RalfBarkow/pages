When their environment changed, they could not adapt and thus did not survive. The ratio of their brain to their mass was small, and so they were forced to use almost all of their information processing capacity on internal body maintenance, and therefore had too little to spare for successful negotiation of the external environment. Is this not what happens to the dinosaurs that are companies? They, similarly, spend a disproportionate amount of their information processing capacity on internal management and co-ordination and not enough on negotiating the needs of the external environment. Economies of scale, an industrial concept, create diseconomies of co-ordination in terms of internal management and organization in the new economy."

      "text": "While the past can serve as a guide when navigating change, managers need to make sense not just of the present but also of the imagined future (Rosness et al., 2015; Tapinos and Pyper, 2018). However, there is disagreement in the sensemaking literature about the phenomenological nature of understanding the future (Sandberg and Tsoukas, 2020), especially if it is radically different from the present (Augustine et al., 2019). Building on the work of Karl Weick, some scholars (e.g., Gioia and Thomas, 1996; Schültz, 1967) consider sensemaking about the future to be essentially retrospective, such that the imagined future is viewed through a retrospective lens, as if already complete (Weick, 1969). Even futureoriented notions such as plans are essentially derived from retrospective sensemaking, because “when one thinks about the future,” this thinking is not done in future tense, but rather “in the future perfect tense” (Weick, 1969: 65). While this idea of “future perfect” thinking was introduced to the management literature by Weick, it was first conceptualized by Schültz (1967: 61) who described it as the process of considering an intended future course of action “as if it were already over and done with...pictured as if it were simultaneously past and future”."

While this idea of “future perfect” thinking was introduced to the management literature by Weick, it was first conceptualized by Schültz (1967: 61) who described it as the process of considering an intended future course of action “as if it were already over and done with...pictured as if it were simultaneously past and future”."
