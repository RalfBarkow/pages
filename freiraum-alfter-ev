        "text": "- [[Cultivate Shared Purpose & Values]]. During meetings there is space to talk about shared values, but f.i. during \"building events\" they are enacted. Through the constant need of maintaining the houses the shared values are put into practice. Meetings take place in different houses, where hospitality and a sense of togetherness is enacted. Same happens when working in the community garden, where good coordination, communication, \"Verlässlichkeit\" is put into practice.  Zukunftstreffen\n- [[Strengthen the Nested-I]]. This is an important dimension especially withing each of the houses of the project. At the project level however, it is rather problematic. This is due to the relatively high degree of fluctuation (university-city) on the one hand. On the other hand, there is a lack of consciousness for the fact that the whole idea can only work if the individuals contribute.  \n- [[Decouple Giving & Taking]]. Each group living in a house pays a montly \"use fee\" (not rent). This fee is lower than market prices (ASK HOW MUCH). The guiding principle is to collectively deal with external committments (loans), also if a loan is payed for a specific house, the inhabitants continue paying the use fee for remaining loans for other houses (solidarische Umverteilung). In general the idea of \"self-sustaining financing\" at the house-group level is important. \nWithin the houses, some groups contribute to the use fee according through a [[Bieterrunde]], others do it differently - it's self-governed. In some cases there is decoupling and in general it is possible, as each house-group is self-goverened.  When it comes to additional costs like (electricity, water, sewage, waste management etc) there is a \"per capita Umlage\" -> collective \"Nebenkostenabrechnung\" which is an example of decoupling. \n- [[Practice Gentle Reciprocity]] Those in need (not all) who work for the community substantially get a moderate monthly financial contribution, not a \"payment per hour\", nor a salary. If complex tasks or such that require a lot of effort need to be done, people can get a payment for it (Einmalzahlung). People care for explicitely acknowledging and honoring specific contributions to the project. \n- [[Deepen Interdependency on Nature]] In general there is a rather high individual awareness of the interdependency on nature, which then translates into organic food (each house project), environmentally friendly construction materials whenever affordable (project level), collective garden - which is a subproject that also contributes to connect some people living in different houses of the project  \n- [[Trust Situated Knowing]] In external relationships, f.i. construction related knowledge or administrative tasks like accounting, \"situated knowing\" of the topic, the context and the projects ambition is highly ranked, there are no bidding calls. Internally situated knowing has helped moving forward and sustaining the project, but it became also clear, that trusting it requires to [[Share Knowledge Often & Widely]] in order to avoid knowledge and therefore decision making monopolies.\n- [[Honor Care & Time]]. In 2016 an organizational restructuring began, \"Es wird dem Prozess erlaubt sich zu entwickeln\"; the process is left open ended, basic questions are: What do we need? How do we deal with these needs? Etc - caring for the collective process and giving it the time it requires, with a clear of bringing it to a successful end in due time but not in a distant future. Care activities and time that people spend on the project are explicitely honored. \n- [[Be Creatively Adaptive]] \"Right now we adapt to the situation that a key admon person is leaving and a new organizational structure based on circles is emerging.\" (Verwaltungskreis, Baukreis, Kulturkreis). Creating explicitely a cultural circle is an answer for the lack of consciousness problem described above. In a similar vein the construction and rennovation processes are based on carefully observing what's there and what's possible, and then finding good and sometimes new solutions for the respective needs. \n- Relationship Preserving Conflict Resolution. There is a general lack of procedural clarity and of self-reflection on this topic \n"

        "text": "- [[Cultivate Shared Purpose & Values]]. During meetings there is space to talk about shared values, but f.i. during \"building events\" they are enacted. Through the constant need of maintaining the houses the shared values are put into practice. Meetings take place in different houses, where hospitality and a sense of togetherness is enacted. Same happens when working in the community garden, where good coordination, communication, \"Verlässlichkeit\" is put into practice.  Zukunftstreffen\n- [[Strengthen the Nested-I]]. This is an important dimension especially withing each of the houses of the project. At the project level however, it is rather problematic. This is due to the relatively high degree of fluctuation (university-city) on the one hand. On the other hand, there is a lack of consciousness for the fact that the whole idea can only work if the individuals contribute.  \n- [[Decouple Giving & Taking]]. Each group living in a house pays a montly \"use fee\" (not rent). This fee is lower than market prices (ASK HOW MUCH). The guiding principle is to collectively deal with external committments (loans), also if a loan is payed for a specific house, the inhabitants continue paying the use fee for remaining loans for other houses (solidarische Umverteilung). In general the idea of \"self-sustaining financing\" at the house-group level is important. \nWithin the houses, some groups contribute to the use fee according through a [[Bieterrunde]], others do it differently - it's self-governed. In some cases there is decoupling and in general it is possible, as each house-group is self-goverened.  When it comes to additional costs like (electricity, water, sewage, waste management etc) there is a \"per capita Umlage\" -> collective \"Nebenkostenabrechnung\" which is an example of decoupling. \n- [[Practice Gentle Reciprocity]] Those in need (not all) who work for the community substantially get a moderate monthly financial contribution, not a \"payment per hour\", nor a salary. If complex tasks or such that require a lot of effort need to be done, people can get a payment for it (Einmalzahlung). People care for explicitely acknowledging and honoring specific contributions to the project. \n- [[Ritualize Togetherness]]\n- [[Deepen Interdependency on Nature]] In general there is a rather high individual awareness of the interdependency on nature, which then translates into organic food (each house project), environmentally friendly construction materials whenever affordable (project level), collective garden - which is a subproject that also contributes to connect some people living in different houses of the project  \n- [[Trust Situated Knowing]] In external relationships, f.i. construction related knowledge or administrative tasks like accounting, \"situated knowing\" of the topic, the context and the projects ambition is highly ranked, there are no bidding calls. Internally situated knowing has helped moving forward and sustaining the project, but it became also clear, that trusting it requires to [[Share Knowledge Often & Widely]] in order to avoid knowledge and therefore decision making monopolies.\n- [[Honor Care & Time]]. In 2016 an organizational restructuring began, \"Es wird dem Prozess erlaubt sich zu entwickeln\"; the process is left open ended, basic questions are: What do we need? How do we deal with these needs? Etc - caring for the collective process and giving it the time it requires, with a clear of bringing it to a successful end in due time but not in a distant future. Care activities and time that people spend on the project are explicitely honored. \n- [[Be Creatively Adaptive]] \"Right now we adapt to the situation that a key admon person is leaving and a new organizational structure based on circles is emerging.\" (Verwaltungskreis, Baukreis, Kulturkreis). Creating explicitely a cultural circle is an answer for the lack of consciousness problem described above. In a similar vein the construction and rennovation processes are based on carefully observing what's there and what's possible, and then finding good and sometimes new solutions for the respective needs. \n- Relationship Preserving Conflict Resolution. There is a general lack of procedural clarity and of self-reflection on this topic \n"

More people share the same building/amount of square meters. Even so, people feel that \"I can do what I wanna do there.\" \"If we have 10 people who love dansing we can have a dance floor in our house. This requires on the one hand, that the shared space allows for the activities that emerge and on the other hand, that the general   social process is at least permissive. If both things happen, I feel abundance.\"\n- [[Decouple Giving & Taking]]. Each group living in a house pays a montly \"use fee\" (not rent). This fee is lower than market prices (ASK HOW MUCH). The guiding principle is to collectively deal with external committments (loans), also if a loan is payed for a specific house, the inhabitants continue paying the use fee for remaining loans for other houses (solidarische Umverteilung). In general the idea of \"self-sustaining financing\" at the house-group level is important. \nWithin the houses, some groups contribute to the use fee according through a [[Bieterrunde]], others do it differently - it's self-governed. In some cases there is decoupling and in general it is possible, as each house-group is self-goverened.  When it comes to additional costs like (electricity, water, sewage, waste management etc) there is a \"per capita Umlage\" -> collective \"Nebenkostenabrechnung\" which is an example of decoupling. \nIn general, the designs allow for a certain degree of openess to others (non-members) and for different kinds of activities.

        "text": "- [[Ensure Fair Abundance]] Compared to common patterns of living in the region (person/square meter) the density in the Freiraum Houses is higher. More people share the same building/amount of square meters. Even so, people feel that \"I can do what I wanna do there.\" \"If we have 10 people who love dansing we can have a dance floor in our house. This requires on the one hand, that the shared space allows for the activities that emerge and on the other hand, that the general   social process is at least permissive. If both things happen, I feel abundance.\"\n\n- [[Decouple Giving & Taking]]. Each group living in a house pays a montly \"use fee\" (not rent). This fee is lower than market prices (ASK HOW MUCH). The guiding principle is to collectively deal with external committments (loans), also if a loan is payed for a specific house, the inhabitants continue paying the use fee for remaining loans for other houses (solidarische Umverteilung). In general the idea of \"self-sustaining financing\" at the house-group level is important. \nWithin the houses, some groups contribute to the use fee according through a [[Bieterrunde]], others do it differently - it's self-governed. In some cases there is decoupling and in general it is possible, as each house-group is self-goverened.  When it comes to additional costs like (electricity, water, sewage, waste management etc) there is a \"per capita Umlage\" -> collective \"Nebenkostenabrechnung\" which is an example of decoupling. \nIn general, the designs allow for a certain degree of openess to others (non-members) and for different kinds of activities.

People care for explicitely acknowledging and honoring specific contributions to the project. \n- [[Ritualize Togetherness]]\n- [[Deepen Communion with Nature]] In general there is a rather high individual awareness of the interdependency on nature, which then translates into organic food (each house project), environmentally friendly construction materials whenever affordable (project level), collective garden - which is a subproject that also contributes to connect some people living in different houses of the project  \n- [[Trust Situated Knowing]] In external relationships, f.i. construction related knowledge or administrative tasks like accounting, \"situated knowing\" of the topic, the context and the projects ambition is highly ranked, there are no bidding calls.

Board meets regularly, but as a general rule board meetings are open to all members. Many decisions have to do with renovation. The houses are organized collectively, that is to assure commoner's Consent in Decisionmaking happens at the house level. Within the Verein the decisions are taken within the \"circles\" and in \"Vorstand\".

Aber die Häuser werden auch Orte und Begegnungszentren, viel Besuch, Freundeskreise, Feste, Nachbarschaften, Flohmärkte - so dass Räume, die eigentlich \"individuell\" genutzt werden, auch - streckenweise - zur Nutzung für andere zur Verfügung stehen. Nicht prinzipiell, sondern auf Anfrage. Social Limits - for instance to exclude people who don#t have the financial means is something we can deal with. \n- [[Relationalize Property]]. Ein Mitglied ist solange Miteigentümer/in des Hauses wie er die Beziehung zum Haus lebt, also den Wohnraum bewoht. Die einzelnen Hausprojekte verfügen weitgehend autonom als Hausgruppe über die Häuser. Wobei es weniger Freiheiten gibt als beim Mietshäusersyndikat - denn es gibt nur einen einzigen Verein. Die einzelnen Wohnprojekte verfügen über keine eigene Rechtsform. Dh. es muss mehr mit dem \"großen Verein\" abgestimmt werden, als beim [[Mietshäusersyndikat]].

But I guess they are not accessible to all. There are also folders for the individual houses with access rights for the specific house projects. But in General it is easy to get the information one needs, if asked for - because it is so complex that it would not work to share every information with everybody. \nThere is also a great deal of openess during the meetings of the circles. Conflicts regarding transparency came up because the information and the way to deal with it (f.i. Buchhaltung) was so complex, that people didn't really get it anymore. Nobody could really understand the numbers, but it was no due to a lack of transparency or trust, but to overly complex form of structuring information and tools. This already lead to frustration and conflict. In principle there is access to the data of the house you live in; there you can also see individual data (who paid his/her rent and who didn't); But the \"Vorstand\" has accesso to all folders and accounts.  \n- [[Finance Commons Provisioning]]\n- [[Self-Monitor & Apply Graduated Sanctions]]. Once per month the person who oversees the numbers, sents an update to all members so that problems can be detected in time.

For instance, the renting-contract clearly states, that everybody is obliged to work one week per year for the common purpose - being it cultural activities, the renovation of the houses (people themselves live in) or others. Even though, some contribute considerably more than others - the ones who are really convinced be the usefulness and transformational power of the project. \n\nWithin this small federation of housing projects, members [[Practice Gentle Reciprocity]]. Those in need (not all) who work for the community substantially get a moderate monthly financial contribution, not a \"payment per hour\", nor a salary. If complex tasks or such that require a lot of effort need to be done, people can get a payment for it (Einmalzahlung). People care for explicitely acknowledging and honoring specific contributions to the project. \n"

The guiding principle is to collectively deal with external committments (loans), also if a loan is payed for a specific house, the inhabitants continue paying the use fee for remaining loans for other houses (solidarische Umverteilung). In general the idea of \"self-sustaining financing\" at the house-group level is important. \nWithin the houses, some groups contribute to the use fee according through a [[Bieterrunde]], others do it differently - it's self-governed. In some cases there is decoupling and in general it is possible, as each house-group is self-goverened.  When it comes to additional costs like (electricity, water, sewage, waste management etc) there is a \"per capita Umlage\" -> collective \"Nebenkostenabrechnung\" which is an example of decoupling. \nIn general, the designs allow for a certain degree of openess to others (non-members) and for different kinds of activities.

This fee is lower than market prices. It can be established by the inhabitants/members themselves. The guiding principle is to collectively deal with external committments (loans). In fact the use fee paid by each member consists of \nEach house-group decides autonomously how to pool & divide up the financial means needed. This way, also people with very littel economic resources can move in - but the monthly sum for the loan/ credit must always be paid.   \n"

In some cases there is decoupling and in general it is possible, as each house-group is self-goverened.  When it comes to additional costs like (electricity, water, sewage, waste management etc) there is a \"per capita Umlage\" -> collective \"Nebenkostenabrechnung\" which is an example of decoupling. \nIn general, the designs allow for a certain degree of openess to others (non-members) and for different kinds of activities.
