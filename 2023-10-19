One co-worker pointed to this paper which claims to prove that asynchronous distributed consensus is impossible. I read the abstract but have not confirmed to the proof rigorously—but I will say the claim aligns perfectly with my experience. I share it here because I think a big piece of the genius in federated wiki is the exploration of what kind of computing it nevertheless possible and even powerful when you give up on an illusion of consensus. https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3149.214121  Compare the paper to Ward's discussion of [[Folk Memory]]. http://splash.fed.wiki.org/folk-memory.html"
