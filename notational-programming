      "text": "Today, typewritten systems form the de-facto standard and dominant paradigm for computer programming. Yet, at the advent of programming, the earliest computer programming notations were handwritten, not typed. In the celebrated 1945 First Report on the EDVAC, for instance, [[John von Neumann]] equated diagrams to text and vice-versa [63]. In fact, notations were only serialized and called programming ‘languages’ when typewriter interfaces were appropriated for programming [4]."

        "text": "As a case study, we explore quantum programming and designed a notation, Qaw, that extends quantum circuit notation with abstraction features, such as variable-sized wire bundles and recursion. Results from a usability study with novices suggest that users find our core interaction of implicit cross-context references intuitive, but suggests further improvements to debugging infrastructure, interface design, and recognition rates."
