There is a need for a divestment of memory, and for this there are archives and media that allow the past and possibly the forgotten to be updated again and again. This also applies to social memory, which produces nothing but present constructions of the past. Esposito attempts to think together cultural history, media, and the evolution of social forms of differentiation, which, as the reviewer points out, leads on the one hand to \"brilliant insights,\" but on the other hand also to many a \"forced abstraction.\" Esposito sees the present in the sign of the search engine: it networks, always only up-to-date, anew. Old memory models, registers and catalogs, have had their day. Whether or not this description is appropriate, says Werber, will be determined by the memory of the future, in which this book will or will not appear."
