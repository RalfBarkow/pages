The duplication of the world produced by the code always runs back into immanence, moreover – and this seems very important – into the side of the code that opposes the preference gradient towards transcendence.

Structures and processes oriented toward transcending immanence are immanent structures and processes, in the case of transcendence-related communication devastatingly this-worldly social systems. Religion systems form, one could say, behind the back of transcendence-related communication. The non-preferential world is continually produced, and in this sense the paradox of the unity of the immanence/transcendent schema [Immanenz/Transparenz; sic!] is catalytic, and in this sense it produces the typically Christian [[Suffering]] from the world. One can make this paradoxical figure sensuously tangible by means of the stagyriths, the column saints, who – ascending into the vertical – seek to escape what they – fleeing – produce themselves: the abstruse, the inescapably consistent hirsuteness of the column.",

Discourse is a mode of communication in which one system is coupled to another by a channel through which information flows in one direction only. The purpose of discourse is to match the passive system to the active one through information (example teacher-student). The purposefulness of discourse distinguishes it from the purposelessness of dialogue. Discourse consists of a series of propositions, the first proposition being an intention and all the rest its consequences. As a design, the entire discourse is already contained in the resolution. The discourse is an explanation of the intention, with the aim that it is received as information by the receiver. The intention is the norm, the \"value\" of the discourse. The discourse is evaluative, imperative, even if its individual sentences seem like statements. like statements. Something volitional, exciamatory and declamatory lies in the structure of every discourse. This gives it its character, which is not only evaluative but also progressive. Examples of discourses are religions and ideologies; the best example is the natural sciences, where the normative character is not immediately obvious. But philosophy can also show that they start from intentions, raise these intentions to norms and then explain them. In short, discourse differs from dialogue not only by its monovalency, but also by the fact that it has deliberately set values for itself in order to communicate them to others.",

Thus in shortening the hours of work the courts can no longer say this is an \"unwarrantable interference\" with individual liberty; they have to consider the health of the individual in its relation to his family and his work, also the use he will make of his leisure, the need he has for time to perform his duties as citizen, etc. etc.  Mr. Pound points out with great clearness that relation is taking the place of contract in modern law.  Workman's compensation arises from the theory of reciprocal rights and duties and liabilities which flow from a relation.  This he tells us was the common law conception until deflected by contract; now we are going back to it and we do not ask the strict terms of the contract, but what the relation demands.",

There, groups were easy to discover because of the formal organization of work and their spatial (machine-related) coherence. But this also spared the question whether the extent to which formal organization leads to the formation of informal groups does not vary from type of organization to type of organization, so that the findings on informal organization can only be generalized to a very limited extent. During many years of work in public administration, [[Niklas Luhmann]] had encountered [[Coalition]]s and [[Network]]s of various kinds, but not groups in a sense that could be delimited on the basis of their self-understanding.",

Structures and processes oriented toward transcending immanence are immanent structures and processes, in the case of transcendence-related communication devastatingly this-worldly social systems. Religion systems form, one could say, behind the back of transcendence-related communication. The non-preferential world is continually produced, and in this sense the paradox of the unity of the immanence/transcendent schema [Immanenz/Transparenz; sic!] is catalytic, and in this sense it produces the typically Christian [[Suffering]] from the world.

The purposefulness of discourse distinguishes it from the purposelessness of dialogue. Discourse consists of a series of propositions, the first proposition being an intention and all the rest its consequences. As a design, the entire discourse is already contained in the resolution. The discourse is an explanation of the intention, with the aim that it is received as information by the receiver. The intention is the norm, the \"value\" of the discourse. The discourse is evaluative, imperative, even if its individual sentences seem like statements. like statements. Something volitional, exciamatory and declamatory lies in the structure of every discourse. This gives it its character, which is not only evaluative but also progressive. Examples of discourses are religions and ideologies; the best example is the natural sciences, where the normative character is not immediately obvious. But philosophy can also show that they start from intentions, raise these intentions to norms and then explain them.

Modern law considers individuals not as isolated beings, but in their relation to the life of the whole community.  Thus in shortening the hours of work the courts can no longer say this is an \"unwarrantable interference\" with individual liberty; they have to consider the health of the individual in its relation to his family and his work, also the use he will make of his leisure, the need he has for time to perform his duties as citizen, etc. etc.  Mr. Pound points out with great clearness that relation is taking the place of contract in modern law.  Workman's compensation arises from the theory of reciprocal rights and duties and liabilities which flow from a relation.  This he tells us was the common law conception until deflected by contract; now we are going back to it and we do not ask the strict terms of the contract, but what the relation demands.",
