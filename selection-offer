Already the speaker and even more so the receiver of a communication thus perform a selective function in the direction of successful reproduction of meaning. This selective treatment of communications is a mass, everyday occurrence. It can be tested by Garfinkeleien. As a permanent phenomenon of human coexistence enforced by the variation mechanism of language, it initially remains without major cultural-historical significance and almost without risk. Almost nothing depends on the acceptance or rejection in the individual case for the society itself and for its evolution. Nevertheless, here lies the evolutionary potential with respect to the selective function of evolution, namely the possibility to form independent selective mechanisms which change the conditions of selective success and adapt them to the development of the social system. Only the selective realization of the aspects of selective success of communications controls the evolution."

For interaction systems, a proportion that is not too low is likely to be a condition for the continuation of interaction. In this respect interaction systems tend to keep the share of non-effective communication small. For social systems capable of evolution - and in this respect again the discussed level differentiation is significant - this tendency does not apply without further ado. It even seems to be reversible within certain limits. On the level of social evolution the difference between comprehensible and assumed communication marks the difference of the mechanisms for variation and for selection. The larger the difference, the larger the range of selection and thus the selectivity of evolutionary selection (which is something quite different from the selectivity of individual communication and the probability of its adoption)."
