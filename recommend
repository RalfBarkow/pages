It iterates over each [[Poem]] in the `chosen` array and for each node in each poem's graph, it adds the hashed representation of the node to the `vocabulary` set.\n4. It defines a function called `[[similar]]` which takes a graph as input and checks if any node in the graph has a hashed representation that matches any in the `vocabulary` set. If such a match is found, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n5. It retrieves the `beam` from a `croquet.view` object (assuming `croquet.view.beam()` returns the beam) and iterates over each checkbox input element within the `beam`.\n6. For each checkbox, it determines whether it is similar to the chosen items by calling the `similar` function with the corresponding graph from the `beam`.\n7.
