Something is also said about the relation in which Sohn-Rethel wants to grasp this relation: for in commodity form and thought form there is a common concept: the concept form. It can thus be assumed that Sohn-Rethel is concerned with proving that the commodity and thinking have something in common in terms of form. That thinking and commodity show something like structural similarities, similarities which indicate that commodity and thinking, as different as they may seem at first sight, have a common origin."

What Sohn-Rethel thus thinks of wanting to work out the forms, contents, or structures common to the various objects, he expresses succinctly with an appeal addressed to Althusser, transforming the latter's training text, widely used especially in the seventies, entitled: Das Kapital lesen, into the injunction: Lirez le capital, M.

My contention, then, is that Kant has proved science practiced today to be 'untrue' because it has not taken the step that the latter's epistemology has taken. This contains a further, seemingly presumptuous assertion: namely, that all philosophies and points of view before Kant have been irrefutably proven to be false by him. In support of this presumption I can indeed refer to Kant himself: for he leaves no doubt at any point in his work that for him all philosophers and thinkers before him were dogmatists, and that he was the first to overcome this dogmatism. But who takes such a self-assessment of a philosopher seriously; after all, every philosopher has claimed to be the greatest – and, I claim: who does not think this of himself as a philosopher, has missed his profession.

I will only briefly explain how one can immediately recognize this regression: anyone who argues on the basis of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason cannot possibly claim that reference to empirical data can give any judgment even the appearance of validity. Or vice versa: anyone who has grasped Kant's basic idea cannot possibly claim that the validity of a judgment follows with necessity from a logically correct deduction. Since Kant, these judgments have a different place for their validity, for their truth, than logic or empiricism. And since Kant, one cannot claim that different judgments derive their validity from different sources: the validity of moral judgments, for example, has a different ground than the validity of physical laws, and so on. And certainly not the claim that there is no such thing as a universally valid truth, which has meanwhile also become part of everyday consciousness: the latter is not possible for the simple reason that a judgment can only ever be either true or false. Who, on the other hand, claims that there is no such thing as a universally valid truth, would, if he were consistent, therefore have to renounce the delivery of any judgment on principle. Apart from the fact that the judgement: there is no generally valid truth, blatantly contradicts itself: such a human being, a human being therefore, who does not pass any judgement, I have never met, but only those who were able to pass fixed judgements about everything and anything. (By the way: in addition he would have to deny that the law of falling is valid for all bodies without exception, that two and two under all circumstances, in all conceivable worlds, as Leibniz expresses it, makes four, etc.). To emphasize the importance that judgment has for our everyday life, let us only consider that man can survive a few weeks without eating, a few days without drinking. Not for one second, however, can man exist without judgment: Without the judgment, e.g., to be a human being, the human being would be the animal, to which not only the science called behavoristic would like to analyze him down.

But Kant does nothing else than to show how judgments must be constituted, so that they can redeem the claim that every judgment automatically raises out of itself: namely, to be a valid judgment. Kant does not want more or less than to name the place from which these judgments gain their validity. If this place is named, then all problems arise again – however completely differently than before. In order to understand Sohn-Rethel now, one cannot avoid the knowledge of this place. Therefore, first of all the answer to the question, what Kant's original cognitive achievement consists of, an achievement, which actually raises him above all philosophers before him – and, as Hörisch claims, up to Sohn-Rethel also after him."

The Kantian transcendental subject, at any rate, whose relation to the concept of reason of the Enlightenment is not the object here – Dahlmann only refers to the fact that, if it is indeed a central thought in Sohn-Rethel, all relations and concepts are placed in a completely new context of meaning – the transcendental subject is thus, seen for itself, in all its positivity and in all its negativity at the same time, that is, completely and without any remainder, identified by Sohn-Rethel as the place in which capital is constituted as capital.

From this follows a problem that is posed to a philosophy that refers to Kant: It must be able to show why, with a high intellectual effort, an alleged place must be constructed from which all validity derives its ground, only to find out, when one looks at reality 'armed' in this way, that it is also possible without it. In other words: apparently Kant constructs the existence of an ominous being, which appears nowhere and of whose knowledge a knowledge is not necessary at all, in order to be able to explain the actual reality."

This is another reason why Sohn-Rethel attaches such outstanding importance to the clarification of the relationship between Marxism and science. But this argument aims only at the honesty of the opponent – but this is no real argument. A philosophy that wants to be a reproduction of reality in thinking must also succeed in naming in this reality the moment out of which a society, which is claimed to need the transcendental subject for its existence, can nevertheless do without a knowledge of it in its thinking and acting. Marx, most clearly in the chapter on [[Fetish]]es, which most Marxists regard as 'highly mysterious', has tried to show how bourgeois society succeeds in being able to reproduce itself without needing an actual consciousness of the basic conditions of its existence, but on the contrary: has to keep this very consciousness at bay in order to be able to reproduce itself at all. In this point, then, one can fall back on Marx – but his presentation has a shortcoming that apparently disqualifies him as an authority of appeal in this discussion. For neither directly nor indirectly is anything said by him about the grounds of validity of his account. And it is precisely for this reason, as the central thesis of Sohn-Rethel's critique of Marx goes, that positivism was able to find its way into Marxism, that the pre-critical spirit, despite Hegel, was able to develop a destructive force for Marxism as a standpoint of thought."

One can then still speak of a bourgeois ideology that is constituted by the mode of action of capital, i.e. do exactly what the Marxists have always done since Marx. But epistemologically one has only the choice to become a Kantian, i.e. to construct an abstract place in the beyond of thinking and capital, from which both scientific thinking and capital draw their truth, or else, and this choice is the much closer one: to immediately defect to [[Positivism]] – as Lenin and in his wake scientific socialism have demonstrated. That is one. Or, and this is the other, and this is what Sohn-Rethel wants: one must be able to represent to what extent it is capital itself that also constitutes scientific thought.

Even if – in the Metaphysics – it is about the proposition of the excluded third, it is only implied as a sheer matter of course – this proposition itself refers to a more serious problem for Aristotle than the problem of identity (which, as said, is actually none at all for him, as little as for us today). There the problem of the excluded third, which nowadays is often read only as another expression of the proposition of identity, in reality refers to the problem of the existence of only one God, which we do not need to deal with here. Here, on the contrary, it is necessary to point out a historically indisputable empirical datum: because on the basis of this Aristotelianism, and also on the basis of all other systems of thought, which existed before and beside the modern one of the Western Occident, it has nowhere come to the discovery of even one single law of nature. Because, in short: such a discovery requires to raise the proposition of identity to the – this is decisive – central postulate of all reflection at all. I.e., in all clarity: one must no longer start from the sheer self-evidence that logically consistent thinking is only possible if one accepts the theorem of identity. Rather, one must directly demand from the things, from the concepts, that they have to obey the proposition of identity – so that I can recognize them as subject at all.

Dahlmann chooses his example from mathematics: No mathematician will deny that the absolute validity of every equation can only be assumed as given, if the opposite (Hegelian: the non-identical) of this absolute validity is axiomatically assumed as valid – and that means here: only from the assumption that the theorem of identity is supposed to be valid, I can conclude that mathematics, insofar as it actually obeys this supposed to be valid, actually redeems the opposite of this supposed to be valid: namely, it is absolute in its validity."

But better, we have to be quite precise here: money, too, is after all a reflection-determination – with highly metaphysical quirks, as Marx elaborated in the fetish chapter. We must not say money: but [[Coin]]. And quite banally the coin that each of us has in his pocket as a penny, a dime or a mark. >> coin"

This object is the same for everybody – and this completely regardless of the fact that everybody holds another one in the hand. This object owes itself to purely human constitution: no animal, not even the gods, need money. And, this is the decisive step of proof for Sohn-Rethel: indeed, the concrete coin may be subject to physical changes in time: but I have to think of money as being a self-same being through all temporality and spatiality. In this it differs from all other empirical things. And further: for this money, resp. the coin, one can buy something: everybody something else – in the decision, what he buys, everybody is free. What one wants to have for the money is thus put into the arbitrariness of each individual. Descartes sends his regards. And yet the validity of money in its objectivity is unassailable. And so on and so forth – in this way one can bring in the whole value-form analysis of Marx, and not only show exactly how by this little 'trick' not only his value-form analysis acquires downright empirical conclusiveness, but, as Sohn-Rethel also demonstrates: that all the philosophical concepts, from the beginning of the emergence of philosophy, represent nothing but a reflection on the mysteries hidden in each piece of money."

On the contrary, only the free decision of individuals to accept money as a measure of value makes money money. This free decision, it is in the nature of things, could actually be revoked. And the possibility of such a revocation establishes the horror, explains the primal fear of every citizen, which he seeks to banish wherever possible. The identity under which man is forced to consider money, so that it remains what it is: namely, generally recognized representative of value, this compulsion brought about out of a primal fear, explains that the purely analytical thinking of science – although it has been proven wrong in every respect by Kant – is nevertheless maintained: whatever the cost in logical antinomies. The identity of money in the different, its absolute untransgressability – with complete freedom in the concrete application – exactly this is not only the basis of scientific thinking, but the basis of bourgeois thinking and its practice as a whole. >> fear"

That would be sheer metaphysics – would be nothing more than just another expression of purely analytical thinking, such as a Lenin demonstrates when he tries to be an epistemologist. Sohn-Rethel does not even claim that Kant, for instance, with his transcendental subject, is actually talking about money, Hegel, when he starts from the spirit, Nietzsche, from power, etc. None of this is to be asserted here, none of it would do justice to Sohn-Rethel. The point was only to show that if one only reflects consistently enough on the functional mechanisms of money in society (mind you: I only have to actually perform this reflection, I need neither know nor say in this what I am actually reflecting on), that then the realization that all this functioning must be based on a third thing, out of which all judgments can claim their validity, is inevitable, and that it is then just inevitable to waffle something about a transcendental subject, a spirit, a will, a power, etc. which it would be that holds the world together in its innermost, which would therefore be the core of the pudel – which brings Dahlmann back to Goethe and Hörisch."

Now, one should think, they become directly accessible to the understanding and can prove themselves before the judgment seat of reason as meaningfully put into effect.

All the talk of the last two thousand years of human history about ideals, about the beautiful, the true, the good, about science and reason, about liberty, equality, fraternity, served, and continues to serve, a single purpose: namely, that of doing everything so that the reason out of which money attains its general validity is not lost. For without this reason there would be neither a valid right, neither a state, neither a scientific knowledge nor any other general one: there would not even be the [[I]], with whose uncrossable reality the people of modern times have finally resigned themselves, and with which they have learned to identify themselves, so that they can function in this society. From this ego, the individual can procure the security of not being alone in this world, of not being the windowless monad that Leibniz was so afraid of. Out of the fear of having to recognize that it is himself who puts into effect all that which he then re-identifies as untransgressible, the individual mutated into a philosopher constitutes the most fantastic metaphysical systems. And like these philosophers, every individual constructs a reality for himself, which, although it is he alone who constructs it, nevertheless does not want to shape it, but leaves its shaping to a being, of whose existence he suddenly does not want to know anything further. It constitutes capital and thus mutates into a subject that is satisfied with being able to pass on to this capital the responsibility that this individual would actually have as a human being for its construction. \"One must be realistic\": in this sentence the abysmal scandal, the impudence with which man deals with himself under capitalist conditions is expressed."

Here there are deficits that cannot be overlooked, deficits that are reminiscent of the deficits of Kant's remarks on the transcendental subject. For Sohn-Rethel is not able, for example, to explain how money could transform itself into capital. With him it seems as if with the simultaneous emergence of coin money and philosophy also the transcendental subject was already fully developed: at least Sohn-Rethel cannot sufficiently refute this objection, which is quite rightly raised by Left Hegelianism. To this only this much: he cannot do so because he does not distinguish sharply enough between a social synthesis as it existed in antiquity and the present one, the capitalist one. In this lecture Dahlmann has tacitly tried to correct Sohn-Rethel in this matter with his references to Aristotle: this could of course only be done implicitly here and thus will not dissuade any Left Hegelian from his reservations. Moreover, Dahlmann maintains that a sufficient solution of this problem cannot be done philosophically at all: but here one must argue historically-empirically and devote oneself again to the process of original accumulation. But this is another topic, and Dahlmann can only assure that Sohn-Rethel's basic idea loses nothing of its significance even in such a turn to history."

But, and he has seen this shortcoming himself without being able to solve it: he does not succeed, strangely one must say, in drawing a consistent connection between his epistemological critique and his theory of fascism. This, too, is anything but an insoluble problem – which again Dahlmann can only assure at this point, but not really prove (on this, however, he can refer to [[Joachim Bruhn]]'s lecture this evening)."

With his deficits Sohn-Rethel is quite comparable to Kant, whose deficits could be overcome very quickly by Hegel. With regard to Sohn-Rethel, however, there is no need today for a Hegel correcting him: for with Marx there is one who, if one subjects Sohn-Rethel's thought to him, as it were, has already done most of the work in this respect."

Communism, if it really represents something other than a socially reformed capitalism, has to give an answer to the central question of how the synthesis is to be constituted in it, out of which the individual human being actually constitutes himself as the generic being endowed with reason, as which the philosophers have always postulated him. With Sohn-Rethel all previous answers to this question have been unmasked as philosophical, i.e.: they proved to be ideological. They were, like mathematics, like natural science, like empiricism, like common sense as a whole, nothing more and nothing less than right thinking in wrong consciousness. This is exactly what Sohn-Rethel denounces as the core of ideological thinking: namely to think correctly, i.e. adapted to the prevailing reality, but this in a complete misjudgment of the nature of this reality, which can only be characterized as barbaric."

I will only briefly explain how one can immediately recognize this regression: anyone who argues on the basis of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason cannot possibly claim that reference to empirical data can give any judgment even the appearance of validity. Or vice versa: anyone who has grasped Kant's basic idea cannot possibly claim that the validity of a judgment follows with necessity from a logically correct deduction. Since Kant, these judgments have a different place for their validity, for their truth, than logic or empiricism. And since Kant, one cannot claim that different judgments derive their validity from different sources: the validity of moral judgments, for example, has a different ground than the validity of physical laws, and so on. And certainly not the claim that there is no such thing as a universally valid truth, which has meanwhile also become part of everyday consciousness: the latter is not possible for the simple reason that a judgment can only ever be either true or false. Who, on the other hand, claims that there is no such thing as a universally valid truth, would, if he were consistent, therefore have to renounce the delivery of any judgment on principle. Apart from the fact that the judgement: there is no generally valid truth, blatantly contradicts itself: such a human being, a human being therefore, who does not pass any judgement, I have never met, but only those who were able to pass fixed judgements about everything and anything. (By the way: in addition he would have to deny that the law of falling is valid for all bodies without exception, that two and two under all circumstances, in all conceivable worlds, as Leibniz expresses it, makes four, etc.). To emphasize the importance that judgment has for our everyday life, let us only consider that man can survive a few weeks without eating, a few days without drinking. Not for one second, however, can man exist without judgment: Without the judgment, e.g., to be a human being, the human being would be the animal, to which not only the science called behavoristic would like to analyze him down.

The progress of philosophy, grasped in the Hegelian meaning, which unfolds through its own contradictoriness up to - at least - the condition of the possibility of a self-awareness of the spirit in man, is not denied by Sohn-Rethel either. But if one subsumes the history of philosophy completely under this progression: I remind you of Hegel's famous play on words with Aufheben in the threefold meaning, then, Sohn-Rethel thinks quite rightly, the central meaning of Kant's thought is lost, a thought that differs in its quality from all thinking in pre-Kantian philosophy."

The progress of philosophy, grasped in the Hegelian meaning, which unfolds through its own contradictoriness up to - at least - the condition of the possibility of a self-awareness of the spirit in man, is not denied by Sohn-Rethel either. But if one subsumes the history of philosophy completely under this progression: I remind you of Hegel's famous play on words with Aufheben in the threefold meaning, then, Sohn-Rethel thinks quite rightly, the central meaning of Kant's thought is lost, a thought that differs in its quality from all thinking in pre-Kantian philosophy."

Hegel no longer knows all these limitations: the only limitation he knows is the spirit itself, which out of itself brings identity and non-identity into the relation appropriate to it. And finally, Hegel succeeds perfectly unconstrained in proving Kant's transcendental subject to be what it is: namely, anything but an eternal constituent of universal humanity, but a historical result of the history of the development and unfolding of the human spirit. Just this historicity, formulated in contrast to Kant, alone makes Hegel naturally much more attractive for materialism than Kant."

        "text": "With Kant, the framework in which the transcendental subject – or better: reason – can unfold is very narrow: this reason, if it wants to be itself, i.e.: reasonable, is not able to go beyond the a priori categories set with space, time, causality and modality; and even less beyond the compulsion to develop an identity for itself: there Kant is still a prisoner of the Cartesian coordinate system. Hegel no longer knows all these limitations: the only limitation he knows is the spirit itself, which out of itself brings identity and non-identity into the relation appropriate to it. And finally, Hegel succeeds perfectly unconstrained in proving Kant's transcendental subject to be what it is: namely, anything but an eternal constituent of universal humanity, but a historical result of the history of the development and unfolding of the human spirit. Just this historicity, formulated in contrast to Kant, alone makes Hegel naturally much more attractive for materialism than Kant."

For Sohn-Rethel, when he took up Marx's Das Kapital in the hope of being able to remedy his anger here, was anything but an academically trained philosopher, but was about to graduate from high school and was reading Das Kapital under the school desk."

Moreover, I maintain that a sufficient solution of this problem cannot be done philosophically at all: but here one must argue historically-empirically and devote oneself again to the process of original accumulation. But this is another topic, and I can only assure that Sohn-Rethel's basic idea loses nothing of its significance even in such a turn to history."

        "text": "If Dahlmann always speaks of \"solvable problems\" here, this does not mean of course that unsolvable ones could not arise: but this can only be the case if one really faces the insight of Sohn-Rethel and does not remain in a defensive attitude, which is not surprising in normal academic philosophy, but which is bad for left-wing Hegelianism – not to mention the Krisis people around [[Robert Kurz]]. With his deficits Sohn-Rethel is quite comparable to Kant, whose deficits could be overcome very quickly by Hegel. With regard to Sohn-Rethel, however, there is no need today for a Hegel correcting him: for with Marx there is one who, if one subjects Sohn-Rethel's thought to him, as it were, has already done most of the work in this respect."

        "text": "According to Sohn-Rethel, a critique of the synthesis constituted by capital can in any case no longer pretend that communism represents nothing more than the solution of the problems posed by capitalism. Communism, if it really represents something other than a socially reformed capitalism, has to give an answer to the central question of how the synthesis is to be constituted in it, out of which the individual human being actually constitutes himself as the generic being endowed with reason, as which the philosophers have always postulated him. With Sohn-Rethel all previous answers to this question have been unmasked as philosophical, i.e.: they proved to be ideological. They were, like mathematics, like natural science, like empiricism, like common sense as a whole, nothing more and nothing less than right thinking in wrong consciousness. This is exactly what Sohn-Rethel denounces as the core of ideological thinking: namely to think correctly, i.e. adapted to the prevailing reality, but this in a complete misjudgment of the nature of this reality, which can only be characterized as barbaric."
