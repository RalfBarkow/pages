Bored with his wondrous, couch-potato existence, Siddhartha wandered out of the kingdom and thereby witnessed the daily forms of pain and suffering of life: It is said he came upon a sick person, an old person, and a dead person. (I doubt he had to travel far. Today, it's still so incredibly easy.) Not understanding what he was seeing, and getting evasive answers from dear old Dad, he left the palace grounds in search of the truth.",

It was influenced by Chinese thought when the Buddha's teachings were taken from India to China by Bodhidharma. In particular, there are strong influences of Taoism, which shares Buddhist thoughts on reality which comes from a parenting school called Yogacara.
