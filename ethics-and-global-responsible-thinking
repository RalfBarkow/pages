His primary example is taken from the construction of infrastructure in the city of New York, where city planner [[Robert Moses]] decided to build bridge overpasses between New York City and Long Island that were too low in height to allow buses to pass through. From his racist and classist perspective, people unable to afford cars were not welcome in Long Island, a rich suburban area, and he built this politics directly into the infrastructure of the roads and transportation systems.

Be aware that it is impossible to separate the technical from the political, which clearly means recognizing the macroimplications of research as it is taken up and used to build sociotechnical systems for use in the real world."
