      "text": "The capacity for a system to monitor and control its behavior using information communicated from the environment is called self-regulation. The majority of self-regulating systems operate on the basis of negative feedback. They compare the current state of the variable or variables they are monitoring with the desired state and make appropriate adjustments as a divergence occurs. The major characteristic of self-regulating systems is that control is implicit. The action of a variable going out of control triggers the regulatory mechanisms to bring it back under control.\n"
