The organization is a private company, and the operating model is entirely geared toward securing government contracts for homecare in the context of the Dutch law, including tax and social security legislation. Buurtzorg is, for what I know, not a cooperative, and the patients are not members and do not have a say in the governance of the organization. So what are the commons here and how is it protected from serving private business interests? It may be a great example of whatever business case there is to make, but it isn't a case of commoning. The remainder of the text is not mine - OB.\n"

This includes such pro-active steps as knocking at the neighbor's door to solicit their assistance.\n- Identify and include formal carers.\n- Care delivery\n- Support the client in his/her social roles.\n- Promote self-care and independence [http://interlinks.euro.centre.org/model/example/NeighbourhoodCareBetterHomeCareAtReducedCost html]\n"

Buurtzorg is, for what I know, not a cooperative, and the patients are not members and do not have a say in the governance of the organization. So what are the commons here and how is it protected from serving private business interests?
