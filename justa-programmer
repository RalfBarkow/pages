I posit that your 'value' has nothing whatsoever to do with what those skills actually are. Thus, programmers are currently cheaper than CEOs, because CEOs are rarer. CEOs are rarer because of contingent reasons - to sell yourself as a CEO, you must claim relevant experience, and starting a business is something fewer people have the occasion to do than learning to program. If you want to be a highly paid programmer, acquire rare skills that are or will be in high demand. -- [[Laurent Bossavit]]",

CEOs are rarer because of contingent reasons - to sell yourself as a CEO, you must claim relevant experience, and starting a business is something fewer people have the occasion to do than learning to program.
