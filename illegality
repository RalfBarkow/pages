The adjective illegalis (unlawful) is understood as a negation of the Old Latin 'legalis', but originates from medieval church Latin. In Old Latin, however, a second linguistic root is found, namely 'ilex', which means both 'lawless, living without law, not conforming to laws' and 'alluring, charming, seductive'. The German adjective illizit can also be traced back to it and means clandestine, because morally objectionable, behavior in the gray area of social evolution. In Rome, however, legalis was used only marginally and synonymously with legitimus."

And legitimacy advanced to a central concept of politics with the transition to modernity (Luhmann 1983; 2002)."

While Kant (1839: 223, note) still described it as an inability to understand, Grotefend (1869: 308), almost 100 years later, placed the distinction between legal/illegal in the context of the emergence and change of constitutions (cf. also Mommsen 1893: 188). With the rise of ideologies and revolutionary movements, the potential of illegality as a strategic concept of struggle and as a medium of political subversion became apparent (cf. Lukácz 1923; Schmitt 1980; 1963)."

At the same time, in the context of everyday communication, but also in legal, political and scientific discourse, it remains unclear how illegality is to be distinguished from other forms of unlawful deviance. Accordingly, it is attributed to the behavior of persons as well as to organizations and states, to functional systems as well as to events, stocks, states or things, and even the attribution itself can be labeled as illegal."

Both change reality, so that one is constantly confronted with new occasions for programmatic reactions\" (Baecker 2008; cf. Baecker 2001: 122-123). By doubling reality into a forbidden and a non-forbidden variant, the possibility arises for society that it can distinguish the right from the wrong in a double way. It can then observe - and both reject and reinforce - the same thing in opposite ways, not only as right but also as wrong, through both non-prohibited and prohibited procedures, opening up additional evolutionary options."

With the rise of ideologies and revolutionary movements, the potential of illegality as a strategic concept of struggle and as a medium of political subversion became apparent (cf.

And it always refers to primary ordering and coupling performances of at least two functional systems (law and politics, cf. Wagner 2006) and of organizations, and would thus be a typical form of second (or even third) order observation. This means that in our search for the forms of illegality we should focus on observing those observers who register that structures at the intersection of law, politics and organization problematize themselves in the direction of indifference and therefore call them illegal."

        "text": "Illegality, on the other hand, uses lawlessness not as a threat but as a seductive, anarchic promise. But illegality also creates problems for itself through this re-inclusion, because the confrontation of those motivated by the lure of lawlessness with the blackmailing inherent lawfulness of illegality turns out to be all the harsher. This is cushioned by ever more promises of egalitarianism and complicitly generated profits."

The aforementioned form of hybridization also responds to mutually exclusive formal expectations by coupling the legal inaccessibility and identity and control performances of networks with the power-based resources of formal, informal, and forbidden decision-making. Double bind and schizophrenia, on the other hand, enable the violative fulfillment of likewise mutually exclusive but non-formalizable expectations within the diffusivity of family communication (cf. Luhmann 1964: 43-44)."

By coupling otherwise non-couplable, because mutually exclusive, formal expectations, the modal medium makes observational alternatives available and testable under the special condition of not being allowed to become known. And thus also points to the question of whether the fulfillment of formal inclusion expectations becomes more and more dependent on their vulnerability and thus on the manifold forms of illegality and their functional equivalents."
