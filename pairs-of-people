The vast majority of communication (>90% of messages) are exchanged on public channels. The channels do not denote topics, but are named after [[pairs of people]], such as #personA-personB. The goal is to [[connect people]] first and have work follow the connection, rather than the other way around. We find that this works reasonably well in our case, in particular given that the same persons often end up tackling rather distinct problems."
