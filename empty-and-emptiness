The distinction between empty and emptiness is all that is necessary to construct traditional mathematics. The empty simple space is the foundation upon which a deeper understanding of the process of creating symbols can be built. In its essence, the conversion from emptiness to empty space is the process of picking up a piece of paper with the intent to record tokens. It is an acknowledgement of a sentience that is creating symbols. As a starting point, the genesis of an empty space from emptiness incorporates the mathematician as the fundamental mathematical construct. Next, I will attempt to demonstrate that this distinction is indeed informative."
