I think that's because we subconsciously associate higher intelligence with the ability to elaborate on complex ideas without pause. Many of the speakers I listen to regularly are quite eloquent and intelligent to begin with, so hearing them speak at 2x often makes them seem intellectually superhuman."

Don't recall if it was with audio only or video (where you can potentially get extra 'bandwidth' from reading lips) but with an 'average' speaker it does start getting tricky for me ~2.5 in my native languages and need to modulate speed often. I'm sure you can 'train' for this, maybe I've been doing that throughout the years as at this point 2x seems 'normal' to me but I'd predict there is a 'ceiling' and that ceiling is probably around 3x, but probably less. If I recall 4x just seems unintelligible gibberish to me üòÇ"

At the same time, real skills are developed by doing a lot of not necessarily \"fun\" exercises. Not sure there's anything too ground-breaking in that, though the speaker mentions that most approaches basically leave the students to explore on their own, with only limited explanation or guidance."
