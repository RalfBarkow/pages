It was because Freedman was sleeping with her. “Carl said to me that I should make some big work as he thought the small-scale stuff I was doingat the time wouldn’t stand up well. I was furious. Making that work was my way at getting back at him.”\n\n[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–199]]5 can be\ninterpreted (perhaps in the way “An Interview with\nHRH” actually functioned) as a vengeful gesture, but\nnot as productive labour. Carpenter writes that, like the Princess of Wales, the contempo-\nrary artist is a stand-in for capital. She represents it. She is neither a wage labourer nor an entrepreneur: she risks herself. “Capitalism can be\ndescribed as a limit”, Carpenter explains, “only productive labour operating in a violently circumscribed systemic totality is able to increase value. This law of value flattens the nature of reality.”"

After passing through half\nof Margate, she got started on London.\nEmin talks about her Tent as an act of revenge.\nWhen Carl Freedman, the curator of “Minky Manky”,\ntold Emin that she couldn’t be in the exhibition unless\nshe showed up with something of epic proportion, it\nwasn’t because he didn’t, necessarily, respect her as\nan artist. It was because Freedman was sleeping with\nher. “Carl said to me that I should make some big\nwork as he thought the small-scale stuff I was doing\n\nat the time wouldn’t stand up well. I was furious. Mak-\ning that work was my way at getting back at him.”\n\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 can be\ninterpreted (perhaps in the way “An Interview with\nHRH” actually functioned) as a vengeful gesture, but\nnot as productive labour.\n\nLike the Princess of Wales, the contempo-\nrary artist is a stand-in for capital. She represents\n\nit. She is neither a wage labourer nor an entrepre-\nneur: she risks herself. “Capitalism can be\n\ndescribed as a limit”, Carpenter explains, “only\n\nproductive labour operating in a violently circum-\nscribed systemic totality is able to increase value.\n\nThis law of value flattens the nature of reality.”\n\nWhat appears as cultural production, social capi-\ntal, immaterial labour, emotional labour, whatever\n\n– is, in fact, a form of control. Is Emin’s tent a\n\nmodel of the art world? Or an allegory for the Mod-\nern Woman, exemplified by Di – the woman trying\n\nto escape tradition, only to find herself subject to\nthe trappings of history? The tent appears as a baby\n\nsatellite, resisting an outside that feels as danger-\nous and incendiary as an inside joke.\n\nIn her Independent column, it’s evident\nthat the only thing Emin likes more than Star Trek\n\nis sleeping. Elsewhere beyond the Tent, she fre-\nquently talks about sleeping: sleeping with, but\n\nalso sleeping in, sleeping to ... “The only place I\nseem to find happiness is when I’m asleep. And the\n\nfirst moment I wake up and just for a second I for-\nget where I am. Just existing, being, without the\n\nweight of the Self.” When Tracey sleeps, it’s not\n\nunproductive, nor is it reproductive. It’s non-\nproductive. Carpenter would call this the opposite\n\nof value, or what William Blake designated as\n“trance”. Trance, Tracey: inside her tent is “the\n\nlocation of revolutionary desire. There is no out-\nside of value, only a virtual trance-like status.”\n\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995\nis an invocation of sleep and thus, surrender. It has\nnothing to do with those inside, the insiders: “Not\nonce in that tent did it say the names of anybody I\nhad ever had sex with”, Emin reconfirmed in 2008,\n“There was no differentiation, because the work\nwas about intimacy.” Is this gesture of surrender\n– succumbing to sleep, drifting off – a path towards\n\nresistance, refusal? Carpenter: “To prevent this out-\nside becoming just a decorative capitalist fantasy\n\nlike a video game – and thus an assignable space\n– one has to refuse its status as reality rather than\nreinforcing it. This is not the trance of Surrealism\nor even psychoanalysis, where what is imaginary\nis considered equally real; but one simultaneously\nmore full and empty.” Perhaps sleep, for Tracey, is\nan inside job, and one she wouldn’t do again, not\neven for a million quid. After the warehouse fire,\nCharles Saatchi begged her to remake the tent. She\ncouldn’t, she explained. Despite the jokes that\n\ninevitably arose (“She’ll have to get a bigger tent”),\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 wasn’t\nan object. It was an event.\nIn 2008, Tracey Emin was in Uganda during a\nmoment in which much of the country was edging\ninto civil war. She chose to remain there to complete\nthe charity mission she was involved in, the creation\n\nof a library for a local high school. “I often feel dissat-\nisfied or dislocated in my life, like I am not complete”,\n\nshe wrote from room 302 at the Serena Hotel in\nKampala. “I tire of seeing the spoils of my hard work\nconstantly pouring into a vat of myself.” At which\npoint, her driver urged her to go outside. She didn’t\nwant to go anywhere tourists go, and much of the city\nwas unsafe. But she went anyway. In her column, she\ndescribes the globalisation, the billboards that would\ngive Saatchi & Saatchi a run for their money, the\nstacks of charcoal that resembled installation art.\nThen she went even further outside: “There were lots\nof people with sores and festering limbs, amputees\n\nwith swollen, infected flesh that looked like some-\nthing out of the Great Plague. And everybody, just\n\nabout everybody, had bright red eyes. All of this took\nplace under an umbrella of semi-darkness. I didn’t\nwant to be a tourist and I wanted to see something I\nhad never seen before. What I saw was my ignorance\n\nand my naiveté. These people weren’t the poor peo-\nple, these were the ones making a living, this was\n\ncommerce.”\nTRACEY EMIN was born in Margate in 1963\nand currently lives between London,\nMargate, and the South of France.

        "text": "In a 2006 interview, Julian Schnabel will\ncommend Emin for how open and willing she is to\nshare from the grotto of her personal life. For a\nworking-class woman who, throughout the 1990s,\n\n\nTracey Emin\n\nVictoria Campbell By\nEveryone\nI Have Ever Slept With 1963– 1995\n\n(1995)\n\nTracey Emin slept her way\nto the top – but not like\nthat. Before her unmade\nbed became the talk of\nGreat Britain, the unruly\nYBA perfected the art of\nself-disclosure by pitching\na tent in the South\nLondon Gallery, inviting\nviewers to venture into\nher intimate history and\ndream of relationships\nunbound by capital.\n\n44\n\nOne Work\n\nTracey\nEmin 45\nwas known to the majority of the public as the wan\n-\nton contemporary artist who’d appeared drunk on\ntelevision more than once, Emin’s response to\nSchnabel is nothing short of Foucauldian: “People\nsay my work is confessional.” This is delivered with\n-\nout a trace of irony. On the “Minky Manky” floor,\nthe entrance to Emin’s tent was drawn open, and\nflashlights were offered, inviting guests to lay back\non the patchwork tarpaulin, open their eyes and\nthink of England. The nepotism (“She’s slept with\neveryone – even the curator!”) was more scandal\n-\n\nous than the implication of sex.\nSix months after The Tent appeared, and on\nthe opposite pole of 90s London, Princess Diana of\nWales surrendered herself to the BBC on the current\naffairs television programme Panorama. One could\ndescribe the six months Emin spent in her living room\nin Waterloo sewing the 102 names into a consumer\ngrade camping tent in the same terms as one could the\nfifty-four minutes HRH sat in a padded living room\nfacing the young journalist Martin Bashir to tell “her\nside of the story” about separating from Prince Charles.\nToday, the “scoop of the decade” continues to generate\ncurrency; a number of documentaries on the docu\n-\nmentary circulated British media channels on the\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the event. “Well, it took a\n\nlong time to understand why people were so inter-\nested in me, but I assumed it was because my husband\n\nhad done a lot of wonderful work leading up to our\nmarriage and our relationship”, the Princess recited\n\ncarefully. “But then I – during the years, you see your-\nself as a good product that sits on a shelf and sells well,\n\nand people make a lot of money out of you.”\nTracey Emin and Princess Di cross paths on\nthe spectral plane of paparazzi and God-given right;\nperhaps their images pass through one another like\nghosts in a tabloid-infused dream. They occur on an\naxis of late capitalist subjectivity which could consti\n-\ntute the Second British Invasion: the 90s were the\nera of not only the YBA, but Thom Yorke, Vivienne\nWestwood, Bridget Jones’s Diary, and, of course, the\nmonarchy. These cultural phenomena were undeni\n-\nably framed by the drama of confessional media:\n\nstateside, Real World held a sovereign timeslot on\nMTV; meanwhile, Hole’s seminal album, Live\nThrough This, had already been ranked the #1\nrecord of 1994. One didn’t need to look far to see the\ncultural logic of lived authenticity on full display.\nEmin was one of the first women to become\na professor at the Royal Academy of Art since the insti\n-\ntution was founded in the eighteenth century.\n\nShe has been awarded at least two honorary doctor-\nates, has dined with the Queen of England, and was\n\nappointed Commander of the Order of the British\nEmpire in 2013. Unlike Diana, she is allowed to get\naway with bad behaviour; like Diana, she has also\nbeen accused of “not having an intellectual bone in\nher body”. Both women were and are luxury goods.\nIt’s a status that confuses critics who would make the\n\nclaim that Emin’s work is her life, and who under-\nstand Emin’s autobiographical practice as inextrica-\nble from her, her body, the totality of herself.\n\nThe patchworked letters on the tarpaulin floor of the\ntent read like an epigraph: “With myself, always\nmyself, never forgetting”. But it matters that the tent\nwas empty, that its formal integrity interrogates the\nvacant space between clothing and architecture, and\nmost of all, that its interior was reserved not for the\nbody of the artist but for the gaze of an outside that\nhad penetrated Emin since before she could bleed.\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995\nwas art history’s ultimate wall text. How much does\nit really matter, art historically, or even ontologically,\nthat the tent was destroyed? Do the men of power\ninside still afford Emin her visibility? Or have these\nindividuals slipped away into abstraction, into the\n\nwhat-could-have-been of the aborted foetus, into sur-\nplus value? In The Outside Can’t Go Outside, Merlin\n\nCarpenter unpacks the discourse on art’s potential\nto extract value from social relations. This, Carpenter\nexplains, often leads to rushed conclusions about\nwhat constitutes artistic labour and how the process\nof cultural value is understood as productive.\nThe celebrity afforded to the British elite on the part\nof UK’s privately funded cultural institutions begs the\nquestion of “intrinsic value” and invokes speculation\n\nLike the Princess of Wales, the contemporary artist is\n\na stand-in for capital. She represents it.\n\nShe is neither a wage labourer nor an entrepreneur:\n\nshe risks herself.\n\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 (detail), 1995\n\nPhotos: © Tracey Emin.

Carpen-\nter asks what constitutes an artwork’s worth: “The\n\nguarantee of the biography of the artist? The power\nof the gallery? Price fixing or oligarchy? Energy stolen\nfrom the bohemians who decorate the room?\nOr something intrinsic to a work which evidently\ncould be anything?” Emin has never spoken about\nthe “intellectual” labour embedded in any of her\nworks. Instead, she talks about survival.\n\nTracey Emin was born two hours outside Lon-\ndon on Margate Sands, the same dreary locale\n\ndescribed in T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land: “I can con-\nnect / Nothing with nothing. / The broken fingernails\n\nof dirty hands. / My people humble people who\nexpect / Nothing”. The blue igloo tent, she says,\nreminded her of the resort town she grew up in, a\ntown she affectionately refers to as “The Last Resort”;\na town she barely made it out of alive and that did not\nmourn her when she finally did. Her first experience\nof blocked ascension was at the age of twelve: dropped\nfrom her French class, she remembers sobbing in her\nmother’s bedroom over a border she’d never be able\nto cross despite the fact that it was only twenty-two\nmiles away. “It’s not like I could just go and get some\nFrench lessons, or even go and buy learn-to-speak\nFrench cassettes. That was my chance gone”, she\nwrites, looking back on the experience in her column.\nBy the age of thirteen, she’d reinvented her education\nentirely with something she called “The Springboard\nEffect”. It involved a totally different definition of\nsleeping, or at least a different definition than the\n\nTent: “When I say sleeping, I mean sex”, Emin con-\nfesses to her readers. “Full-blown penetrative sex.\n\nI felt that every time I slept with someone new, I was\nsomehow sent to another place.” By the time she left\ntown, she’d “experienced the journey of passing\nthrough somebody else”.

The dome\ncamping tent, the interior of which Emin hand\nappliqued the names of everyone she’d ever volun-\nteered her consciousness to, quickly became an\nicon of [[Young British Art]]. “It took me six months to\nmake”, she recalls, after learning that the work was\ndestroyed, ten years later, when [[Charles Saatchi]]’s art storage warehouse caught fire.

        "text": "In a 2006 interview, Julian Schnabel will\ncommend Emin for how open and willing she is to\nshare from the grotto of her personal life. For a\nworking-class woman who, throughout the 1990s,\n\n\nTracey Emin\n\nVictoria Campbell By\nEveryone\nI Have Ever Slept With 1963– 1995\n\n(1995)\n\n\n44\n\nOne Work\n\nTracey\nEmin 45\nwas known to the majority of the public as the wan\n-\nton contemporary artist who’d appeared drunk on\ntelevision more than once, Emin’s response to\nSchnabel is nothing short of Foucauldian: “People\nsay my work is confessional.” This is delivered with\n-\nout a trace of irony. On the “Minky Manky” floor,\nthe entrance to Emin’s tent was drawn open, and\nflashlights were offered, inviting guests to lay back\non the patchwork tarpaulin, open their eyes and\nthink of England. The nepotism (“She’s slept with\neveryone – even the curator!”) was more scandal\n-\n\nous than the implication of sex.\nSix months after The Tent appeared, and on\nthe opposite pole of 90s London, Princess Diana of\nWales surrendered herself to the BBC on the current\naffairs television programme Panorama. One could\ndescribe the six months Emin spent in her living room\nin Waterloo sewing the 102 names into a consumer\ngrade camping tent in the same terms as one could the\nfifty-four minutes HRH sat in a padded living room\nfacing the young journalist Martin Bashir to tell “her\nside of the story” about separating from Prince Charles.\nToday, the “scoop of the decade” continues to generate\ncurrency; a number of documentaries on the docu\n-\nmentary circulated British media channels on the\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the event. “Well, it took a\n\nlong time to understand why people were so inter-\nested in me, but I assumed it was because my husband\n\nhad done a lot of wonderful work leading up to our\nmarriage and our relationship”, the Princess recited\n\ncarefully. “But then I – during the years, you see your-\nself as a good product that sits on a shelf and sells well,\n\nand people make a lot of money out of you.”\nTracey Emin and Princess Di cross paths on\nthe spectral plane of paparazzi and God-given right;\nperhaps their images pass through one another like\nghosts in a tabloid-infused dream. They occur on an\naxis of late capitalist subjectivity which could consti\n-\ntute the Second British Invasion: the 90s were the\nera of not only the YBA, but Thom Yorke, Vivienne\nWestwood, Bridget Jones’s Diary, and, of course, the\nmonarchy. These cultural phenomena were undeni\n-\nably framed by the drama of confessional media:\n\nstateside, Real World held a sovereign timeslot on\nMTV; meanwhile, Hole’s seminal album, Live\nThrough This, had already been ranked the #1\nrecord of 1994. One didn’t need to look far to see the\ncultural logic of lived authenticity on full display.\nEmin was one of the first women to become\na professor at the Royal Academy of Art since the insti\n-\ntution was founded in the eighteenth century.\n\nShe has been awarded at least two honorary doctor-\nates, has dined with the Queen of England, and was\n\nappointed Commander of the Order of the British\nEmpire in 2013. Unlike Diana, she is allowed to get\naway with bad behaviour; like Diana, she has also\nbeen accused of “not having an intellectual bone in\nher body”. Both women were and are luxury goods.\nIt’s a status that confuses critics who would make the\n\nclaim that Emin’s work is her life, and who under-\nstand Emin’s autobiographical practice as inextrica-\nble from her, her body, the totality of herself.\n\nThe patchworked letters on the tarpaulin floor of the\ntent read like an epigraph: “With myself, always\nmyself, never forgetting”. But it matters that the tent\nwas empty, that its formal integrity interrogates the\nvacant space between clothing and architecture, and\nmost of all, that its interior was reserved not for the\nbody of the artist but for the gaze of an outside that\nhad penetrated Emin since before she could bleed.\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995\nwas art history’s ultimate wall text. How much does\nit really matter, art historically, or even ontologically,\nthat the tent was destroyed? Do the men of power\ninside still afford Emin her visibility? Or have these\nindividuals slipped away into abstraction, into the\n\nwhat-could-have-been of the aborted foetus, into sur-\nplus value? In The Outside Can’t Go Outside, Merlin\n\nCarpenter unpacks the discourse on art’s potential\nto extract value from social relations. This, Carpenter\nexplains, often leads to rushed conclusions about\nwhat constitutes artistic labour and how the process\nof cultural value is understood as productive.\nThe celebrity afforded to the British elite on the part\nof UK’s privately funded cultural institutions begs the\nquestion of “intrinsic value” and invokes speculation\n\nLike the Princess of Wales, the contemporary artist is\n\na stand-in for capital. She represents it.\n\nShe is neither a wage labourer nor an entrepreneur:\n\nshe risks herself.\n\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 (detail), 1995\n\nPhotos: © Tracey Emin. All rights reserved, DACS / Bildrecht, Wien 2021; Photo: Stephen White & Co; Courtesy: White Cube\n\n46 One Work Tracey Emin 47\n\nregarding the nature of representation itself. Carpen-\nter asks what constitutes an artwork’s worth: “The\n\nguarantee of the biography of the artist? The power\nof the gallery? Price fixing or oligarchy? Energy stolen\nfrom the bohemians who decorate the room?\nOr something intrinsic to a work which evidently\ncould be anything?” Emin has never spoken about\nthe “intellectual” labour embedded in any of her\nworks. Instead, she talks about survival.\n\nTracey Emin was born two hours outside Lon-\ndon on Margate Sands, the same dreary locale\n\ndescribed in T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land: “I can con-\nnect / Nothing with nothing. / The broken fingernails\n\nof dirty hands. / My people humble people who\nexpect / Nothing”. The blue igloo tent, she says,\nreminded her of the resort town she grew up in, a\ntown she affectionately refers to as “The Last Resort”;\na town she barely made it out of alive and that did not\nmourn her when she finally did. Her first experience\nof blocked ascension was at the age of twelve: dropped\nfrom her French class, she remembers sobbing in her\nmother’s bedroom over a border she’d never be able\nto cross despite the fact that it was only twenty-two\nmiles away. “It’s not like I could just go and get some\nFrench lessons, or even go and buy learn-to-speak\nFrench cassettes. That was my chance gone”, she\nwrites, looking back on the experience in her column.\nBy the age of thirteen, she’d reinvented her education\nentirely with something she called “The Springboard\nEffect”. It involved a totally different definition of\nsleeping, or at least a different definition than the\n\nTent: “When I say sleeping, I mean sex”, Emin con-\nfesses to her readers. “Full-blown penetrative sex.\n\nI felt that every time I slept with someone new, I was\nsomehow sent to another place.” By the time she left\ntown, she’d “experienced the journey of passing\nthrough somebody else”. After passing through half\nof Margate, she got started on London.\nEmin talks about her Tent as an act of revenge.\nWhen Carl Freedman, the curator of “Minky Manky”,\ntold Emin that she couldn’t be in the exhibition unless\nshe showed up with something of epic proportion, it\nwasn’t because he didn’t, necessarily, respect her as\nan artist. It was because Freedman was sleeping with\nher. “Carl said to me that I should make some big\nwork as he thought the small-scale stuff I was doing\n\nat the time wouldn’t stand up well. I was furious. Mak-\ning that work was my way at getting back at him.”\n\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 can be\ninterpreted (perhaps in the way “An Interview with\nHRH” actually functioned) as a vengeful gesture, but\nnot as productive labour.\n\nLike the Princess of Wales, the contempo-\nrary artist is a stand-in for capital. She represents\n\nit. She is neither a wage labourer nor an entrepre-\nneur: she risks herself. “Capitalism can be\n\ndescribed as a limit”, Carpenter explains, “only\n\nproductive labour operating in a violently circum-\nscribed systemic totality is able to increase value.\n\nThis law of value flattens the nature of reality.”\n\nWhat appears as cultural production, social capi-\ntal, immaterial labour, emotional labour, whatever\n\n– is, in fact, a form of control. Is Emin’s tent a\n\nmodel of the art world? Or an allegory for the Mod-\nern Woman, exemplified by Di – the woman trying\n\nto escape tradition, only to find herself subject to\nthe trappings of history? The tent appears as a baby\n\nsatellite, resisting an outside that feels as danger-\nous and incendiary as an inside joke.\n\nIn her Independent column, it’s evident\nthat the only thing Emin likes more than Star Trek\n\nis sleeping. Elsewhere beyond the Tent, she fre-\nquently talks about sleeping: sleeping with, but\n\nalso sleeping in, sleeping to ... “The only place I\nseem to find happiness is when I’m asleep. And the\n\nfirst moment I wake up and just for a second I for-\nget where I am. Just existing, being, without the\n\nweight of the Self.” When Tracey sleeps, it’s not\n\nunproductive, nor is it reproductive. It’s non-\nproductive. Carpenter would call this the opposite\n\nof value, or what William Blake designated as\n“trance”. Trance, Tracey: inside her tent is “the\n\nlocation of revolutionary desire. There is no out-\nside of value, only a virtual trance-like status.”\n\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995\nis an invocation of sleep and thus, surrender. It has\nnothing to do with those inside, the insiders: “Not\nonce in that tent did it say the names of anybody I\nhad ever had sex with”, Emin reconfirmed in 2008,\n“There was no differentiation, because the work\nwas about intimacy.” Is this gesture of surrender\n– succumbing to sleep, drifting off – a path towards\n\nresistance, refusal? Carpenter: “To prevent this out-\nside becoming just a decorative capitalist fantasy\n\nlike a video game – and thus an assignable space\n– one has to refuse its status as reality rather than\nreinforcing it. This is not the trance of Surrealism\nor even psychoanalysis, where what is imaginary\nis considered equally real; but one simultaneously\nmore full and empty.” Perhaps sleep, for Tracey, is\nan inside job, and one she wouldn’t do again, not\neven for a million quid. After the warehouse fire,\nCharles Saatchi begged her to remake the tent. She\ncouldn’t, she explained. Despite the jokes that\n\ninevitably arose (“She’ll have to get a bigger tent”),\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 wasn’t\nan object. It was an event.\nIn 2008, Tracey Emin was in Uganda during a\nmoment in which much of the country was edging\ninto civil war. She chose to remain there to complete\nthe charity mission she was involved in, the creation\n\nof a library for a local high school. “I often feel dissat-\nisfied or dislocated in my life, like I am not complete”,\n\nshe wrote from room 302 at the Serena Hotel in\nKampala. “I tire of seeing the spoils of my hard work\nconstantly pouring into a vat of myself.” At which\npoint, her driver urged her to go outside. She didn’t\nwant to go anywhere tourists go, and much of the city\nwas unsafe. But she went anyway. In her column, she\ndescribes the globalisation, the billboards that would\ngive Saatchi & Saatchi a run for their money, the\nstacks of charcoal that resembled installation art.\nThen she went even further outside: “There were lots\nof people with sores and festering limbs, amputees\n\nwith swollen, infected flesh that looked like some-\nthing out of the Great Plague. And everybody, just\n\nabout everybody, had bright red eyes. All of this took\nplace under an umbrella of semi-darkness. I didn’t\nwant to be a tourist and I wanted to see something I\nhad never seen before. What I saw was my ignorance\n\nand my naiveté. These people weren’t the poor peo-\nple, these were the ones making a living, this was\n\ncommerce.”\nTRACEY EMIN was born in Margate in 1963\nand currently lives between London,\nMargate, and the South of France. Her\nrecent major exhibitions include Royal\nAcademy of Arts, London (2020); Musée\nd’Orsay, Paris (2019); Château La Coste,\nAix-en-Provence (2017); Leopold Museum,\nVienna (2015); Museum of Contemporary\nArt, Miami (2013). In 2007, she represented\nGreat Britain at the 52nd Venice Biennale.\nVICTORIA CAMPBELL is an artist, writer,\nand contributing editor at Spike. She lives\nin New York."

For a\nworking-class woman who, throughout the 1990s, was known to the majority of the public as the wanton contemporary artist who’d appeared drunk on\ntelevision more than once, Emin’s response to\nSchnabel is nothing short of Foucauldian: “People\nsay my work is confessional.” This is delivered with\nout a trace of irony.

One could describe the six months Emin spent in her living room in Waterloo sewing the 102 names into a consumer grade camping tent in the same terms as one could the fifty-four minutes HRH sat in a padded living room facing the young journalist [[Martin Bashir]] to tell “her\nside of the story” about separating from [[Prince Charles]]. Today, the “scoop of the decade” continues to generate currency; a number of documentaries on the documentary circulated British media channels on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the event. "

        "text": "“Well, it took a long time to understand why people were so interested in me, but I assumed it was because my husband had done a lot of wonderful work leading up to our marriage and our relationship”, the Princess recited carefully. “But then I – during the years, you see yourself as a good product that sits on a shelf and sells well,\n\nand people make a lot of money out of you.”\nTracey Emin and Princess Di cross paths on\nthe spectral plane of paparazzi and God-given right;\nperhaps their images pass through one another like\nghosts in a tabloid-infused dream. They occur on an\naxis of late capitalist subjectivity which could consti\n-\ntute the Second British Invasion: the 90s were the\nera of not only the YBA, but Thom Yorke, Vivienne\nWestwood, Bridget Jones’s Diary, and, of course, the\nmonarchy. These cultural phenomena were undeni\n-\nably framed by the drama of confessional media:\n\nstateside, Real World held a sovereign timeslot on\nMTV; meanwhile, Hole’s seminal album, Live\nThrough This, had already been ranked the #1\nrecord of 1994. One didn’t need to look far to see the\ncultural logic of lived authenticity on full display.\nEmin was one of the first women to become\na professor at the Royal Academy of Art since the insti\n-\ntution was founded in the eighteenth century.\n\nShe has been awarded at least two honorary doctor-\nates, has dined with the Queen of England, and was\n\nappointed Commander of the Order of the British\nEmpire in 2013. Unlike Diana, she is allowed to get\naway with bad behaviour; like Diana, she has also\nbeen accused of “not having an intellectual bone in\nher body”. Both women were and are luxury goods.\nIt’s a status that confuses critics who would make the\n\nclaim that Emin’s work is her life, and who under-\nstand Emin’s autobiographical practice as inextrica-\nble from her, her body, the totality of herself.\n\nThe patchworked letters on the tarpaulin floor of the\ntent read like an epigraph: “With myself, always\nmyself, never forgetting”. But it matters that the tent\nwas empty, that its formal integrity interrogates the\nvacant space between clothing and architecture, and\nmost of all, that its interior was reserved not for the\nbody of the artist but for the gaze of an outside that\nhad penetrated Emin since before she could bleed.\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995\nwas art history’s ultimate wall text. How much does\nit really matter, art historically, or even ontologically,\nthat the tent was destroyed? Do the men of power\ninside still afford Emin her visibility? Or have these\nindividuals slipped away into abstraction, into the\n\nwhat-could-have-been of the aborted foetus, into sur-\nplus value? In The Outside Can’t Go Outside, Merlin\n\nCarpenter unpacks the discourse on art’s potential\nto extract value from social relations. This, Carpenter\nexplains, often leads to rushed conclusions about\nwhat constitutes artistic labour and how the process\nof cultural value is understood as productive.\nThe celebrity afforded to the British elite on the part\nof UK’s privately funded cultural institutions begs the\nquestion of “intrinsic value” and invokes speculation\n\nLike the Princess of Wales, the contemporary artist is\n\na stand-in for capital. She represents it.\n\nShe is neither a wage labourer nor an entrepreneur:\n\nshe risks herself.\n\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 (detail), 1995\n\nPhotos: © Tracey Emin. All rights reserved, DACS / Bildrecht, Wien 2021; Photo: Stephen White & Co; Courtesy: White Cube\n\n46 One Work Tracey Emin 47\n\nregarding the nature of representation itself. Carpen-\nter asks what constitutes an artwork’s worth: “The\n\nguarantee of the biography of the artist? The power\nof the gallery? Price fixing or oligarchy? Energy stolen\nfrom the bohemians who decorate the room?\nOr something intrinsic to a work which evidently\ncould be anything?” Emin has never spoken about\nthe “intellectual” labour embedded in any of her\nworks. Instead, she talks about survival.\n\nTracey Emin was born two hours outside Lon-\ndon on Margate Sands, the same dreary locale\n\ndescribed in T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land: “I can con-\nnect / Nothing with nothing. / The broken fingernails\n\nof dirty hands. / My people humble people who\nexpect / Nothing”. The blue igloo tent, she says,\nreminded her of the resort town she grew up in, a\ntown she affectionately refers to as “The Last Resort”;\na town she barely made it out of alive and that did not\nmourn her when she finally did. Her first experience\nof blocked ascension was at the age of twelve: dropped\nfrom her French class, she remembers sobbing in her\nmother’s bedroom over a border she’d never be able\nto cross despite the fact that it was only twenty-two\nmiles away. “It’s not like I could just go and get some\nFrench lessons, or even go and buy learn-to-speak\nFrench cassettes. That was my chance gone”, she\nwrites, looking back on the experience in her column.\nBy the age of thirteen, she’d reinvented her education\nentirely with something she called “The Springboard\nEffect”. It involved a totally different definition of\nsleeping, or at least a different definition than the\n\nTent: “When I say sleeping, I mean sex”, Emin con-\nfesses to her readers. “Full-blown penetrative sex.\n\nI felt that every time I slept with someone new, I was\nsomehow sent to another place.” By the time she left\ntown, she’d “experienced the journey of passing\nthrough somebody else”. After passing through half\nof Margate, she got started on London.\nEmin talks about her Tent as an act of revenge.\nWhen Carl Freedman, the curator of “Minky Manky”,\ntold Emin that she couldn’t be in the exhibition unless\nshe showed up with something of epic proportion, it\nwasn’t because he didn’t, necessarily, respect her as\nan artist. It was because Freedman was sleeping with\nher. “Carl said to me that I should make some big\nwork as he thought the small-scale stuff I was doing\n\nat the time wouldn’t stand up well. I was furious. Mak-\ning that work was my way at getting back at him.”\n\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 can be\ninterpreted (perhaps in the way “An Interview with\nHRH” actually functioned) as a vengeful gesture, but\nnot as productive labour.\n\nLike the Princess of Wales, the contempo-\nrary artist is a stand-in for capital. She represents\n\nit. She is neither a wage labourer nor an entrepre-\nneur: she risks herself. “Capitalism can be\n\ndescribed as a limit”, Carpenter explains, “only\n\nproductive labour operating in a violently circum-\nscribed systemic totality is able to increase value.\n\nThis law of value flattens the nature of reality.”\n\nWhat appears as cultural production, social capi-\ntal, immaterial labour, emotional labour, whatever\n\n– is, in fact, a form of control. Is Emin’s tent a\n\nmodel of the art world? Or an allegory for the Mod-\nern Woman, exemplified by Di – the woman trying\n\nto escape tradition, only to find herself subject to\nthe trappings of history? The tent appears as a baby\n\nsatellite, resisting an outside that feels as danger-\nous and incendiary as an inside joke.\n\nIn her Independent column, it’s evident\nthat the only thing Emin likes more than Star Trek\n\nis sleeping. Elsewhere beyond the Tent, she fre-\nquently talks about sleeping: sleeping with, but\n\nalso sleeping in, sleeping to ... “The only place I\nseem to find happiness is when I’m asleep. And the\n\nfirst moment I wake up and just for a second I for-\nget where I am. Just existing, being, without the\n\nweight of the Self.” When Tracey sleeps, it’s not\n\nunproductive, nor is it reproductive. It’s non-\nproductive. Carpenter would call this the opposite\n\nof value, or what William Blake designated as\n“trance”. Trance, Tracey: inside her tent is “the\n\nlocation of revolutionary desire. There is no out-\nside of value, only a virtual trance-like status.”\n\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995\nis an invocation of sleep and thus, surrender. It has\nnothing to do with those inside, the insiders: “Not\nonce in that tent did it say the names of anybody I\nhad ever had sex with”, Emin reconfirmed in 2008,\n“There was no differentiation, because the work\nwas about intimacy.” Is this gesture of surrender\n– succumbing to sleep, drifting off – a path towards\n\nresistance, refusal? Carpenter: “To prevent this out-\nside becoming just a decorative capitalist fantasy\n\nlike a video game – and thus an assignable space\n– one has to refuse its status as reality rather than\nreinforcing it. This is not the trance of Surrealism\nor even psychoanalysis, where what is imaginary\nis considered equally real; but one simultaneously\nmore full and empty.” Perhaps sleep, for Tracey, is\nan inside job, and one she wouldn’t do again, not\neven for a million quid. After the warehouse fire,\nCharles Saatchi begged her to remake the tent. She\ncouldn’t, she explained. Despite the jokes that\n\ninevitably arose (“She’ll have to get a bigger tent”),\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 wasn’t\nan object. It was an event.\nIn 2008, Tracey Emin was in Uganda during a\nmoment in which much of the country was edging\ninto civil war. She chose to remain there to complete\nthe charity mission she was involved in, the creation\n\nof a library for a local high school. “I often feel dissat-\nisfied or dislocated in my life, like I am not complete”,\n\nshe wrote from room 302 at the Serena Hotel in\nKampala. “I tire of seeing the spoils of my hard work\nconstantly pouring into a vat of myself.” At which\npoint, her driver urged her to go outside. She didn’t\nwant to go anywhere tourists go, and much of the city\nwas unsafe. But she went anyway. In her column, she\ndescribes the globalisation, the billboards that would\ngive Saatchi & Saatchi a run for their money, the\nstacks of charcoal that resembled installation art.\nThen she went even further outside: “There were lots\nof people with sores and festering limbs, amputees\n\nwith swollen, infected flesh that looked like some-\nthing out of the Great Plague. And everybody, just\n\nabout everybody, had bright red eyes. All of this took\nplace under an umbrella of semi-darkness. I didn’t\nwant to be a tourist and I wanted to see something I\nhad never seen before. What I saw was my ignorance\n\nand my naiveté. These people weren’t the poor peo-\nple, these were the ones making a living, this was\n\ncommerce.”\nTRACEY EMIN was born in Margate in 1963\nand currently lives between London,\nMargate, and the South of France. Her\nrecent major exhibitions include Royal\nAcademy of Arts, London (2020); Musée\nd’Orsay, Paris (2019); Château La Coste,\nAix-en-Provence (2017); Leopold Museum,\nVienna (2015); Museum of Contemporary\nArt, Miami (2013).

Or an allegory for the Mod-\nern Woman, exemplified by Di – the woman trying\nto escape tradition, only to find herself subject to\nthe trappings of history? The tent appears as a baby\nsatellite, resisting an outside that feels as dangerous and incendiary as an inside joke."

Elsewhere beyond the Tent, she frequently talks about sleeping: sleeping with, but\nalso sleeping in, sleeping to ... “The only place I\nseem to find happiness is when I’m asleep. And the\nfirst moment I wake up and just for a second I for-\nget where I am. Just existing, being, without the\nweight of the Self.” When Tracey sleeps, it’s not unproductive, nor is it reproductive. It’s non-\nproductive. Carpenter would call this the opposite\nof value, or what William Blake designated as\n“trance”. Trance, Tracey: inside her tent is “the\nlocation of revolutionary desire. There is no out-\nside of value, only a virtual trance-like status.”"
