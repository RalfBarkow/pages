However, the concern here is a different one. In exiting the linear structure of the designed digital infrastructure, one is no longer a spectator. Prefab artificiality becomes less relevant. The metaverse is a platform of spectators, the parareal is not. The para-real is the collective art of disappearance."

There are no passengers or passivity in the para-real. A para-social relationship between a livestreamer and their audience is a visceral example of the para-real, but the para-real exists in the moment with the delusional audience member. It is not stored in the VODs of the streamer, nor built into the interface of the streaming platform itself. No matter the fidelity or accuracy, digital archiving only derealises the para-real. Interpassivity is an ontological impossibility here. "

The para-real’s central essence inhabits the body and the subject and it does so subconsciously. The phantom touch phenomena reported by VR players is an example of the para-real; A synthesis of the sociality and the simulation that, when interpreted together, creates an undeniable yet ephemeral moment of sensory feedback by non-existent limbs. You are here, but not here, and neither is the other person. And yet, you feel them. If touch is nothing more than electrical pulses from nerve endings through your central nervous system, didn’t you actually touch?"

The frictions of class, of purchasing power, of privacy and capitalist terraforming all cultivate the para-real as a [[Conflict]] zone. Players in Oculus Quests colliding with a wall in their tiny apartments is a para-real moment, where the software of the headset reaches out into the real world, demanding total dominance over physical space and throwing the attached body against it as collateral."

        "text": "Despite the cynical and (hopefully) short-lived corpo-hype of Silicon Valley’s most visionless and vampiric acolytes, the Meta metaverse cohort delivers an ideological confusion that poisons the public imagination of what the present is and what the future could be. This will take years to reverse. In embarking on this ill-fated conquest, Meta, Tencent, Epic Games, FTX, OpenSea and friends turned every supermarket chain, every Fortune 500, every non-profit, every state-based cultural program of soft power, every newsroom and podcaster, and every art gallery into the world’s most boring game designers cum faux Fintech expert. What Gibson and Stephenson failed to anticipate is the metaverse’s true horror: despite its colossal infrastructure costs, the metaverse is really fucking boring."

To understand how and why the para-real works, one must see it as the unpredictable element: a para-psychological software bug in your brain and your computer simultaneously, a real and tangible glitch-in-the-Matrix kind of affect at odds with the digital malls of the future."

        "text": "From a para-real perspective, the metaverse’s attempt to force yet another monopoly platform standard into existence might be considered a dangerous threat to the multiverse (not one VR stack but many VR islands in the Net). However, the concern here is a different one. In exiting the linear structure of the designed digital infrastructure, one is no longer a spectator. Prefab artificiality becomes less relevant. The metaverse is a platform of spectators, the parareal is not. The para-real is the collective art of disappearance."

It is not stored in the VODs of the streamer, nor built into the interface of the streaming platform itself. No matter the fidelity or accuracy, digital archiving only derealises the para-real. Interpassivity is an ontological impossibility here. But merely engaging in the act of play or other interaction does not invoke the para-real either. The para-real’s central essence inhabits the body and the subject and it does so subconsciously. The phantom touch phenomena reported by VR players is an example of the parareal; A synthesis of the sociality and the simulation that, when interpreted together, creates an undeniable yet ephemeral moment of sensory feedback by non-existent limbs. You are here, but not here, and neither is the other person. And yet, you feel them. If touch is nothing more than electrical pulses from nerve endings through your central nervous system, didn’t you actually touch?"
