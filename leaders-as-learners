The outdated belief we can engineer an outcome, take a top down, directive approach, is no longer the way forward. It may have severed us well, but we are no longer in the industrial age. The world has changed and the evidence is clear that a world view that directs and controls is not improving the necessary outcomes for children or society. Certainly not to the extent that warrants the level of investment of human and financial capital."

This is not what leaders have been doing the last couple of decades and it is time to create the conditions for this transformation to happen.
