This paper describes Symbolics' newly redesigned object-oriented programming system, Flavors. Flavors encourages program modularity, eases the development of large, complex programs, and provides high efficiency at run time. Flavors is integrated into Lisp and the Symbolics program development environment. This paper describes the philosophy and some of the major characteristics of Symbolics' Flavors and shows how the above goals are addressed. Full details of Flavors are left to the programmers' manual, Reference Guide to Symbolics Common Lisp.\n"
