The term originates from English, where it stands for racket, profiteering or crookedness, among other things. The racket concept was coined in the 1940s by the Institute for Social Research, which had been exiled to the United States, especially by Max Horkheimer. In 1997, the ideology critic Wolfgang Pohrt, drawing on Horkheimer, attempted in his book Brothers in Crime to determine the conditions under which society is replaced by a system of cliques and gangs. In 1998, iz3w also discussed the extent to which racket theory can be used to understand these processes, for example in the thematic focus \"Politics in Gangs\" (iz3w 227)."
