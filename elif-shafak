      "text": "Elif Shafak is what is rightly called a public intellectual: She is Turkey's most widely read writer, her books are translated into more than 50 languages, and she has won numerous international awards. She is also considered a smart political voice, followed by over one and a half million people on Twitter and commenting on events in Turkey for international newspapers, for example. However, she is ostracized by the Turkish regime because of her criticism; in 2006, a trial was even sought against her for \"insulting Turkishness.\" Nevertheless, Elif Shafak believes in pluralism and the power of polyphony. In her latest novel, \"The Whisper of the Fig Trees,\" she also tells a love story from several perspectives against the backdrop of the civil war in Cyprus in 1974, which revolves around the themes of identity, origin and uprooting. Barbara Bleisch talks to Elif Shafak about nature, which deserves its own voice, about traumas that are passed down through generations, and about the power of poetry.
