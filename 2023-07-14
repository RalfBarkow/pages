The approach Bråten presented to answer this question, starting from a dynamic-dialogical system perspective, was too radical, and thus his critique could not shake the system-theoretical positions. Luhmann, who had acknowledged the relevance of his statement about \"mutualistic\" or \"dialogical\" constitution, however, was suspicious of the use of such \"demanding terms\". Indeed, Bråten's postulate assumed an innate dyadic constitution with a virtual Alter that leaves the place of the virtual Alter (\"virtual other\") to the actual Alter, allowing the dyad to reproduce itself in the same basic dyadic form. This could explain findings in recent infant research, which is also corroborated by a neurophysiological discovery. The postulate is that infants can be expected to mirror others and unfold in the course of complementary gestures and movements in a self-renewing dyad with adults and others. Neurophysiological findings have discovered a mirroring system in the human brain that presumably supports this type of mirroring."

If we start from the assumption that the boundary of the body cannot be crossed even procedurally, neither in the genetically prefixed nor in the constructive sense, then an intersubjective connection to other subjects is possible only through thought and language, that is, only in an indirect sense. Just as Leibniz had to resort to \"mediation\" by God in pre-established harmony to find an answer to the question of how monads can communicate \"without windows,\" the corresponding modern answer lies in the suggestion of thought and language. As long as one holds that a monadic organism functions only within the confines of its own physical system, the possibility that the organism can put itself into the perspective or situation of another organism in a direct immediate way is ruled out. Today, however, we can refer to infant and brain research results which do not exclude transgression in a direct or movement-conditioned meaning, and which do not presuppose linguistic or higher-order thinking processes. Bråten will try to illustrate this with the following descriptions.\n"

With this demand, the suicide has constructed a reality that does not fit and therefore causes his ship of life to fail. Nothing is further from the inventor of this deadly reality than the wise decision of the king in Alice in Wonderland, who reads the poem of the white rabbit, finds it nonsensical and states both relieved and shrugging: \"If there is no sense in it, it saves us a lot of work, because then we don't need to look for any\" . Wittgenstein expresses the same fact not essentially differently when he writes in the Logical-Philosophical Treatises (paragraph 6.521): \"One notices the solution of the problem of life by the disappearance of this problem\"."
