A few years ago I went to a lecture on \"Social Psychology,\" as the subject was announced.  Not a word was said except on the nervous systems and other aspects of individual psychology, but at the last moment the lecturer told us that had there been time he would have applied what he has said to social conditions!  It reminded me of the mental processes of the man who, when he wanted to know something about Chinese metaphysics, first looked up China in the encyclopedia and then metaphysics and put them together.  The new psychology must take people with their inheritance, their \"tendencies,\" their environment, and then focus its attention on their interrelatings.  The most careful laboratory work must be done to discover the conditions which make these interrelatings possible, which make there interrelatings fruitful.",

No one of us will be able to give an answer until we have studied men in association and have discovered the laws of association.  This has not been done yet, but already we can see that a political science which is not based on a knowledge of the laws of association gained by a study of the group will soon seem the crudest kind of quackery.  Syndicalism in reaction to the so-called \"metaphysical\" foundation of politics is based on \"objective rights,\" on function, on its conception of modes of association which shall emphasize the object of the associated and not the relation of the associated to one another.  The new psychology goes a step further and sees these as one, but how can any of these things be discussed abstractly?  Must we not first study men in association?  Young men in the hum of actual life, practical politicians, the members of constitutional conventions, labor leaders -- all these must base their work on the principles of group psychology.",

This may be considered an arbitrary definition, but of course I do not care about names, I only want to emphasize the fact that men meet under two different sets of laws.  Social psychology may include both group psychology and crowd psychology, but of these two group psychology is much the more important.  For a good many years now we have been dominated by the crowd school, by the school which taught that people met together are governed by suggestion and imitation, and less notice has been taken of all the interplay which is the real social process that we have in a group but not in a crowd.  How men behave in crowds, and the relation of the crowd conception of politics to democracy, will be considered in later chapters.  While I recognize that men are more often at present under the laws of the crowd than of the group, I believe that progress depends on the group, and, therefore, that the group should be the basis of a progressive social psychology.  The group process contains the secret of collective life, it is the key to democracy, it is the master lesson for every individual to learn, it is our chief hope for the political, the social, the international life of the future [1].",

A few years ago I went to a lecture on \"Social Psychology,\" as the subject was announced.  Not a word was said except on the nervous systems and other aspects of individual psychology, but at the last moment the lecturer told us that had there been time he would have applied what he has said to social conditions!  It reminded me of the mental processes of the man who, when he wanted to know something about Chinese metaphysics, first looked up China in the encyclopedia and then metaphysics and put them together.  The new psychology must take people with their inheritance, their \"tendencies,\" their environment, and then focus its attention on their interrelatings.  The most careful laboratory work must be done to discover the conditions which make these interrelatings possible, which make there interrelatings fruitful.",

Syndicalism in reaction to the so-called \"metaphysical\" foundation of politics is based on \"objective rights,\" on function, on its conception of modes of association which shall emphasize the object of the associated and not the relation of the associated to one another.  The new psychology goes a step further and sees these as one, but how can any of these things be discussed abstractly?  Must we not first study men in association?  Young men in the hum of actual life, practical politicians, the members of constitutional conventions, labor leaders -- all these must base their work on the principles of group psychology.",

This may be considered an arbitrary definition, but of course I do not care about names, I only want to emphasize the fact that men meet under two different sets of laws.  Social psychology may include both group psychology and crowd psychology, but of these two group psychology is much the more important.  For a good many years now we have been dominated by the crowd school, by the school which taught that people met together are governed by suggestion and imitation, and less notice has been taken of all the interplay which is the real social process that we have in a group but not in a crowd.  How men behave in crowds, and the relation of the crowd conception of politics to democracy, will be considered in later chapters.  While I recognize that men are more often at present under the laws of the crowd than of the group, I believe that progress depends on the group, and, therefore, that the group should be the basis of a progressive social psychology.  The group process contains the secret of collective life, it is the key to democracy, it is the master lesson for every individual to learn, it is our chief hope for the political, the social, the international life of the future [1].",
