Since a famous essay by [[Warren Weaver]], from which a whole literature has emerged in the meantime2 , one knows that there are no adequate scientific procedures and findings for large and complex systems (and these are business enterprises in any case); because science has methods only for systems which are small enough to be described with few variables, or for large but uniform quantities with which one can work statistically. In the face of this research bottleneck, however, there remained only the advice to try anyway, and to gradually expand scientific competence in knowledge of this problem of complexity. Thereby it could be a guideline of complexity reduction to be guided by the specifics of the individual case and to avoid generalizations. As a result, within management consulting firms \"experience\" is cultivated, which is accumulated in a large number of individual projects. And it becomes a problem how these experiences can be recorded, made known and discussed within the consulting group, as it were in seclusion and outside of the current business. But this only leads back again to the problem of induction, to the problem of inadmissible generalizations, and gives a questionable preponderance to the narratives and the assertive \"examples from practice\"."
