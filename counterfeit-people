Counterfeiting has been a problem as long as there has been money. It was recognized several thousand years ago with the first [[Coin]]s, and from the beginning the authorities and wise citizens recognized that counterfeiting is an act of social vandalism or economic vandalism, a crime against the state in every sense, a destroyer of security and trust. Counterfeiters were punished very harshly for centuries, in many places it was a capital offense, and in the United States you can still get 10 years in prison for counterfeiting. Now, counterfeit people are even worse. Fake people will undermine [[Trust]] in people, in the people we deal with in conversations, in the people we see on our computers, in the people we see on television, in the people we hear in phone conversations, and the technology to create very convincing fake people exists now."

Counterfeiting has been a problem as long as there has been money. It was recognized several thousand years ago with the first coins, and from the beginning the authorities and wise citizens recognized that counterfeiting is an act of social vandalism or economic vandalism, a crime against the state in every sense, a destroyer of security and trust. Counterfeiters were punished very harshly for centuries, in many places it was a capital offense, and in the United States you can still get 10 years in prison for counterfeiting. Now, counterfeit people are even worse. Fake people will undermine trust in people, in the people we deal with in conversations, in the people we see on our computers, in the people we see on television, in the people we hear in phone conversations, and the technology to create very convincing fake people exists now."

Counterfeiting has been a problem as long as there has been money. It was recognized several thousand years ago with the first [[Coin]]s, and from the beginning the authorities and wise citizens recognized that counterfeiting is an act of social vandalism or economic vandalism, a crime against the state in every sense, a destroyer of security and trust. Counterfeiters were punished very harshly for centuries, in many places it was a capital offense, and in the United States you can still get 10 years in prison for counterfeiting. Now, counterfeit people are even worse. Fake people will undermine trust in people, in the people we deal with in conversations, in the people we see on our computers, in the people we see on television, in the people we hear in phone conversations, and the technology to create very convincing fake people exists now."
