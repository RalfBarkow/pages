As a language matures it becomes capable of doing more and so more gets done with it, meaning that more and bigger systems will be attempted with it and an improvement cycle starts. The answer, of course, is not to throw away the language but to develop it elegantly since the replacement language will simply go through the same vicious bloat cycle. You must be careful not to break the rule of \"no simpler\" or you are locking yourself out of what you will be able to do and you'll have to start the cycle over without having really gained anything.",

All software has both kinds of complexity, and the goal should be to minimize the accidental complexity. Again, the idea that this goal is 100% achievable is ludicrous to me.

Einstein is no expert on \"simplicity\" or even \"scientific theories\" even if he has made one or more. Einstein also said \"God doesn't play dice with the universe\" which turned out to be...wrong. Einstein also believed in God, which we can assume he learned while sitting on his grandmother's lap. How much else of what he has to offer us is of this folksy homespun quality? In other words, unless Einstein is speaking to his own particular field of physics, and even then assuming it hasn't been superseded or contradicted by later discoveries in that area, there is no real reason to listen to Einstein about anything any more than say you High School Gym teacher or the local dog catcher. The cult of Einstein is to lead us to believe that every word that dropped from his lips was pure gold. Alas, it wasn't. -- Mike ",
