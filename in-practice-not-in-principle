One source of resistance to using in practice constraints is already present in the tension between descriptive history of science and normative philosophy of science, and in the tension between naturalistic approaches (which tend to mean different things to different people) and more traditional philosophy of science. But the appeal to in principle arguments involves a certain kind of idealization, and some idealizations are appropriate whereas others are not. A long-standing epistemological issue involves the limits of knowledge. Are there things that we cannot know, and if so, can we identify them? There surely cannot be any issue that this is a genuine philosophical problem. Of course it is not new – Kant famously gave us answers to the question. The question of what we can know in philosophy of science has been transformed by the rise of computational science and it is partly a question of what idealizations can legitimately be used for epistemic agents. We already have experience in what idealizations are appropriate and inappropriate for various research programmes. The move away from hyper-rational economic agents in micro-economics to less idealized agents within behavioral and experimental economics is one well-known example. For certain philosophical purposes, such as demonstrating that some kinds of knowledge is impossible even in principle, in principle arguments are fine.
