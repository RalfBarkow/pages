      "text": "An unpatched 15-year-old bug in the Python programming language could affect more than 350,000 open-source repositories, and could lead to code execution. The path traversal vulnerability, disclosed in 2007, resides in the Python tarfile package, and can allow hackers to overwrite arbitrary files. The flaw exists because the code in the extract function in Python's tarfile module trusts data in the TarInfo object &quot;and joins the path that is passed to the extract function and the name in the TarInfo object.&quot; Analyst Charles McFarland at extended detection and response solutions provider Trellix rediscovered the bug while probing another security issue. No reports indicate the bug has been exploited in attacks, although it remains a threat in the software supply chain."
