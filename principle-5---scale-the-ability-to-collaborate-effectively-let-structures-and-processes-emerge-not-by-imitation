The work should start at the single team level trying to make things work there,  where those questions should find their answers for your organisation, before scaling. This is suggested by the following principle. And it also helps to learn how to balance quiet voices and dominant voices, how to manage big egos, how to develop more self-awareness, and to create for the team quality time to think.\n\n\n"

Scrum of scrum can be a very expensive way to start. Having staggered Stand-ups instead can, for example, be a minimal way to let people attend other teams' stand-ups on an ad-hoc basis, only when needed (e.g. due to a specific dependency in the current or coming Sprint/Iteration scope)."

Priorities can be arbitrated and orchestrated externally, negotiated internally by the teams involved, or agreed upon collaboratively by all teams involved. It is the nature of the work and the ability of the teams that lead to a solution that is good.
