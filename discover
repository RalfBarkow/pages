        "text": "We think we've opened up a whole new way to use technology. This can happen when one takes some assumed requirement and reverse it. Wiki, for example, reversed the assumption that only the owner should edit the pages of a web site. Parser generators have traditionally been used to describe exactly what should be written and anything else is a \"syntax error\". Wiki allows writers to write what they think makes sense. With [[Exploratory Parsing]] we now have a way for the parser writer to discover what has been written after the fact. This inversion of control mirrors the original thinking behind wiki. Let those who know write as they see fit. Trust people to be regular enough to create lasting value. Use the power of our modern computers and networks to organize that value.
