Both are based on the general idea of [[Schema]]s as a [[Basis for Mental Representation]] (see e.g. Arbib 1989; Brewer and Nakamura 1984; Bartlett 1932; Bobrow and Norman 1975; Rumelhart 1980). According to schema theory, people organize knowledge about familiar objects, situations, and procedures in terms of prototypes, or schemas. A schema consists of a [[Representation]] for common knowledge that is shared by all instances, and a number of slots […]"
