But: \"Of course, the study is not really double-blinded,\" says Reuter, because you can hear the difference between binaural beats and ordinary sounds, so you know which group you are in.

Christoph Reuter has taken a closer look at the meta-analysis and comes to the conclusion that many of the studies included in it themselves had some methodological shortcomings. As for the double-blinded study, Reuter notes that the participants and the researchers may not have known at first into which group they had been placed. But: \"Of course, the study is not really double-blinded,\" says Reuter, because you can hear the difference between binaural beats and ordinary sounds, so you know which group you are in. Which in turn would speak for a placebo effect."
