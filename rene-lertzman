And people who are anxious and alarmed can’t remain alarmed forever. Eventually, we overload and check out. "

      "text": "> “Called ‘one of the nation’s most effective communicators on climate change’ by The New York Times, [[Katharine Hayhoe]] knows how to navigate all sides of the conversation on our changing planet. A Canadian climate scientist living in Texas, she negotiates distrust of data, indifference to imminent threats, and resistance to proposed solutions with ease. Over the past fifteen years Hayhoe has found that the most important thing we can do to address climate change is talk about it-and she wants to teach you how. In Saving Us, Hayhoe argues that when it comes to changing hearts and minds, facts are only one part of the equation. We need to find shared values in order to connect our unique identities to collective action. This is not another doomsday narrative about a planet on fire. It is a multilayered look at science, faith, and human psychology, from an icon in her field-recently named chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy. Drawing on interdisciplinary research and personal stories, Hayhoe shows that small conversations can have astonishing results. Saving Us leaves us with the tools to open a dialogue with your loved ones about how we all can play a role in pushing forward for change”--\n"

It was surprising to observe how long participants carried on without suspecting anything. Self-reflective comments upon video playback indicate that when they became aware something might be wrong, they resorted—among other strategies—to shifting among perspectives and alternating between different kinds of symbolic representations. Why would such a break-down evoke such a resort to a boundary position of reflection? One reason may be that, since they are usually being involved in an intersubjective world of meanings, the insiders cannot refer to it qua insiders. The above incidents occurred in the artificial setting of a laboratory. However, events in more naturally evolving groups, discussing 'Our Computer Milieu of Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow', also indicate that shifts from an insider's position to a boundary position, through the group's own usage of self-reflective video playback, have served to restore a meaning-tight platform for agreement and for disagreement. The conversation sometimes breaks down and participants may show anger when others falsely attribute viewpoints to them that are based on misunderstanding. Relief is expressed when the platform is re-established—even when there is disagreement, as long as it rests on intersubjective understanding."

But even though this control was finally broken, this case not only exemplifies the establishment of a model monopoly, but also shows that the cybernetic paradigm of social systems regulation through symbolic representations is operational only under certain limiting conditions. The historic task of reconstructing a country called for joint and cooperative efforts, a common model platform, and firm leadership. The Norwegian economy was steered in a certain manner, and this mode of steering worked as long as the international environment exhibited a certain degree of stable growth. But even when the environmental shift occurred, the socioeconomic elite continued for a while as if their model was still valid. It took outsiders to recognize that the territory had changed, and that alternative maps were required. There was a gradual recognition of self-regulatory market mechanisms, and of system-internal participatory transformations, operating under their own law, conforming to the conditions consistent with the closure position, (B).\n"

A Canadian climate scientist living in Texas, she negotiates distrust of data, indifference to imminent threats, and resistance to proposed solutions with ease. Over the past fifteen years Hayhoe has found that the most important thing we can do to address climate change is talk about it-and she wants to teach you how. In Saving Us, Hayhoe argues that when it comes to changing hearts and minds, facts are only one part of the equation. We need to find shared values in order to connect our unique identities to collective action. This is not another doomsday narrative about a planet on fire. It is a multilayered look at science, faith, and human psychology, from an icon in her field-recently named chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy. Drawing on interdisciplinary research and personal stories, Hayhoe shows that small conversations can have astonishing results. Saving Us leaves us with the tools to open a dialogue with your loved ones about how we all can play a role in pushing forward for change”--\n"

If model power mechanisms operate, together with attempted adjustments of the \"territory\" to the \"map\", control may then be in part established, especially since the map already is part of the territory – at least as long as the territory does not exhibit catastrophic shifts. \n"

        "text": "A shift did eventually occur, due to the international economic depression that occurred in the middle of the 1970's. But even though this control was finally broken, this case not only exemplifies the establishment of a model monopoly, but also shows that the cybernetic paradigm of social systems regulation through symbolic representations is operational only under certain limiting conditions. The historic task of reconstructing a country called for joint and cooperative efforts, a common model platform, and firm leadership. The Norwegian economy was steered in a certain manner, and this mode of steering worked as long as the international environment exhibited a certain degree of stable growth. But even when the environmental shift occurred, the socioeconomic elite continued for a while as if their model was still valid. It took outsiders to recognize that the territory had changed, and that alternative maps were required. There was a gradual recognition of self-regulatory market mechanisms, and of system-internal participatory transformations, operating under their own law, conforming to the conditions consistent with the closure position, (B).\n"
