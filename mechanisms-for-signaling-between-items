We have sometimes referred to this as a \"magnetic connection\" implying that the influence is broad spread. I have been struggling for a few days trying to merge these two mechanisms: specifically I want to discover and choose a source to my left and then be alerted when it has new data available and update my own state accordingly. This seems a modest variation on the magnetic properties one would expect. But, it is turning out to be difficult to code because we have no wide spread Identification for items on a page. At one time we thought a page slug was sufficient to identify a page but this becomes ambiguous when the same page, or even a twin page, is lined up together. Years ago we worked around this problem by assigning a random \"pageKey\" to each distinct page when added to the lineup. More recently, we distinguish a page retrieved from the federation from a \"panel\" in the lineup that renders that page. The signaling we have been considering here would be between items from a page as rendered in a panel in the lineup. See. What could be simpler?"
