It is through our deep connection to our why, our sense of purpose, that change is less daunting. "

We walk towards the unknown and we become unsettled, we’re in ‘the grip’ and perhaps we sense a kind of chaos. Our comfortableness is disturbed, our order is lost, and we all respond to it differently. It is our courage that reminds us in the midst of it all that it is through change that we are transformed. The chaotic journey is worthy and we know there's a light at the end of the tunnel. We emerge changed by the change. We are different, wiser, and awakened to new thinking. Our worldview has been altered, often for the better – our courage has served us well."

We all have had curveballs thrown our way and have been unwillingly forced to take a journey through them.

We must remind ourselves to take courage, for [[Being in the Grey]] is a worthy journey. "

      "text": "The question of why we’d choose change is an obvious one. But, in education, the suggestion of choosing to change is often met with walls of ‘I’ve always taught this way and it works’ or ‘why fix something that’s not broken’; a resistance to enter the unknown and to instead remain in the safe place of familiar and comfortable order. As we all know, change requires time, committed effort, and free headspace. The mental load of teachers is often at the forefront of leadership teams, and I’d say that this sometimes prevents change from occurring, even when it’s seen as necessary. "

I’d hazard a guess that most whys can be simmered down to ‘What is best for kids.’ Change in education may require us to [[Put Down the Duckie]] and shift our priorities. To stop doing what we’ve always done and to genuinely make time for something better. Change doesn’t mean throwing the baby out with the bathwater. We can reframe this thinking quite simply – it’s doing something better or differently, not additional.  "

We don’t have to journey through in silos and instead can find deeper meaning in changing together. We can collectively muster courage and wander, make time and lean into the unknown guided by our deep, unwavering sense of why. When we do so, we might find we awaken to a new dawn that is more joyous as a result of our unity. "

Personal growth and often a feeling of reinvigoration are sure rewards for the sometimes trying journey. Staying still isn’t a great place to be – it’s where we grow stale and bored and lifeless. Meaningful growth does not come without some discomfort, as we boldly move out of our comfort zone. As we choose change, we find that we gradually get more [[Comfortable Being Uncomfortable]], we find that the disorder is worth it. What emerges following the bold step into change is transformation. You can’t un-see what has emerged. "

I’ve learnt instead to lean into it, guided by 'my why', even though it’s still uncomfortable and probably always will be. For me, there’s now a familiar surrender, an understanding of the journey ahead. I allow myself to fall down the rabbit hole a little more easily, for I know the bright new world, new thinking, new ways will emerge. I am learning to be courageous, despite my fears. I don’t know if change is as good as a holiday, but I do think it’s as good as a strong cup of good coffee – it has immense power to awaken us. "

In education, the suggestion of choosing to change is often met with walls of ‘I’ve always taught this way and it works’ or ‘why fix something that’s not broken’; a resistance to enter chaos and to instead remain in the safe place of order. As we all know, change requires time, committed effort and free headspace. The mental load of teachers is often at the forefront of leadership teams, and I’d say that this sometimes prevents change from occurring, even when it’s seen as necessary. "
