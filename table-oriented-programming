Closure analysis may be tricky though; most CPS representations store environment information in the lexical structure of the CPS representation, which would be lost on conversion to tables.

I'm very curious about a table-based CPS intermediate representation: it looks like there's a full mapping from CPS to relational tables, and this also encodes the complete call graph of the program. Closure analysis may be tricky though; most CPS representations store environment information in the lexical structure of the CPS representation, which would be lost on conversion to tables. If that can be encoded too, however, then you'll have the complete liveness graph of all registers encoded in the intermediate representation.
