      "text": "Absolutist logic makes it very tempting to think of form as something imposed on a passive and malleable substance from the outside, just as jelly can be poured into a pudding mold, and one still finds many examples of such thinking in the natural and social sciences. In anthropology, the nature/nurture debate represents a striking example of this thinking. On the one hand, there are the sociobiologists who see human behavior, and thus culture per se, as essentially shaped by the human genotype, while on the other hand, ethnologists in the tradition of Boas and Margaret Mead claim that human nature is infinitely malleable and that all forms of human thought and behavior are shaped by their culture. Cultural materialists, in turn, have treated ideology as a passive reflection of social structure, which in turn is a reflection of economic base. We will encounter more examples of \"pudding-form thinking\" in the course of this essay."

In anthropology, the nature/nurture debate represents a striking example of this thinking. On the one hand, there are the sociobiologists who see human behavior, and thus culture per se, as essentially shaped by the human genotype, while on the other hand, ethnologists in the tradition of Boas and Margaret Mead claim that human nature is infinitely malleable and that all forms of human thought and behavior are shaped by their culture. Cultural materialists, in turn, have treated ideology as a passive reflection of social structure, which in turn is a reflection of economic base. We will encounter more examples of \"pudding-form thinking\" in the course of this essay."
