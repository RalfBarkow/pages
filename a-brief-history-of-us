Between your daily routine, the decisions you make, the music you hear and the air you breathe – it’s hard to tell the difference between \"my\" choices and \"our\" choices. The vulnerable and moving voiceover of actress Molly Ringwald tells the story of a couple who have gone through such a long journey together that they can no longer determine where one ends and the other begins."
