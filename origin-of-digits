The use of many more channels would\nnegate the possibility of using the frequency-shift telegraph system, which had been\nsuccessfully used over the short wave radio system, the only means available over the\nAtlantic. The suggestion then arose of subtracting out the nearest lower level, multiplying\nthe error signal by six, and treating it as another channel; thus, we obtained thirty six\nlevels with two channels. It was called a Vernier channel, a rather obvious comparison to\nother such arrangements for scaling. It then became apparent that this was a very general\nprocess, an n-ary coding arrangement. If we had used a factor of two instead of six, it\nwould have become a binary system. This then was the way PCM was independently\ninvented at Bell Labs. "

Ten vocoder channels each used a base 6 quantization of segment of the analog voice wave.  In private conversations, Ralph told of the generals rejecting the initial prototype because the voice pitch, then encoded with only 6 levels, was unacceptable.  There was some panic about how to deal with the need for \"about 30 levels\".  Adding 50% more channels just for pitch was prohibitively expensive and prohibitively large in size.  Ralph himself had the insight to multiply two channels and thereby encode 36 levels which provided recognizable vocal pitch.  They ended up with a n-ary encoding, not just binary."

The use of many more channels would\nnegate the possibility of using the frequency-shift telegraph system, which had been\nsuccessfully used over the short wave radio system, the only means available over the\nAtlantic. The suggestion then arose of subtracting out the nearest lower level, multiplying\nthe error signal by six, and treating it as another channel; thus, we obtained thirty six\nlevels with two channels. It was called a Vernier channel, a rather obvious comparison to\nother such arrangements for scaling. It then became apparent that this was a very general\nprocess, an n-ary coding arrangement. If we had used a factor of two instead of six, it\nwould have become a binary system. This then was the way PCM was independently\ninvented at Bell Labs. "

Ten vocoder channels each used a base 6 quantization of segment of the analog voice wave.  In private conversations, Ralph told of the generals rejecting the initial prototype because the voice pitch, then encoded with only 6 levels, was unacceptable.  There was some panic about how to deal with the need for \"about 30 levels\".  Adding 50% more channels just for pitch was prohibitively expensive and prohibitively large in size.  Ralph himself had the insight to multiply two channels and thereby encode 36 levels which provided recognizable vocal pitch.  They ended up with a n-ary encoding, not just binary."
