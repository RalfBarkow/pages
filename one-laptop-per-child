If you're taller than 3 feet, your posture is toast when using a laptop. Unless, of course, the laptop is on a table that's too high for comfortable keyboarding. Either way, you're hosed. So, laptops teach lousy posture or dangerous keyboard use. If the laptop opens up 180 degrees, the kid's best bet might be to loll on his tummy and poke at the keyboard and mouse pad with one hand. But that probably means the kid's eyes are aimed too high for comfort. In short, a laptop is an ergonomic nightmare. (I can also argue that a <i>desktop</i> computer is an ergonomic nightmare for children and other small people, but this page is about laptops.) Then there's the weight. How old are these children before they're expected to lug the laptop in a backpack or carrying case? Plus, keep in mind that books, worksheets, posters, and \"manipulatives\" are easier on the eye than a screen full of pixels no matter what a person's age. They're easier to read than a screen, and the reader is less likely to go nearsighted.",

You can plan on the poor kid having no treasured mementos of school projects unless he gets a fresh machine and converts his files every few years, but who's going to go through the trouble? Then there's the ever changing software in addition to the usual material that the school is trying to teach. Some \"skills\" like drag-and-drop will be useful for another decade, but others will need to be learned and unlearned every couple years or each semester with the software that comes along. Plus, the harried teacher needs to keep on top of the technology ball and figure out how to use whatever \"educational\" software and equipment get tossed at him/her by the higher-ups. One can argue that money is better spent on items that never go obsolete: books, paper, pencils, crayons, scissors, glue, balls, jump ropes, musical instruments, <i>teachers, classrooms, lunches</i>.",

Nope, it was the fact that the power adapter was the same distinctive shade of bright green as the OLPC's case. It was a blindingly obvious solution to the perennial problem of matching power adapters to their devices. If the rest of the machine is as well designed, it could be a real success. -- [[Anonymous Donor]]",

For example, a child might be taught in the classroom that the Earth rotates, orbits around the Sun and that the Moon orbits around the Earth. Visualising this might be difficult at first, but making a simulation is easy; draw the Earth, Moon and Sun, put the Earth and Moon inside a container, then use the simple Logo programs \"Container forward 20; right 1\" to orbit the Sun, \"Moon forward 5; right 12\" to orbit the Earth and \"Earth right 60\" to make the Earth spin. By putting a dot on the edge of the Earth to represent an observer, it becomes much more intuitive to see what comes into and out of the observer's line of sight over the course of a day, a month and a year. Then, with a computer to hand, it becomes much easier to persue \"what if\" questions, which can often be a great way to gain insight and test your own understanding of a subject.",

If you're taller than 3 feet, your posture is toast when using a laptop. Unless, of course, the laptop is on a table that's too high for comfortable keyboarding. Either way, you're hosed. So, laptops teach lousy posture or dangerous keyboard use. If the laptop opens up 180 degrees, the kid's best bet might be to loll on his tummy and poke at the keyboard and mouse pad with one hand. But that probably means the kid's eyes are aimed too high for comfort. In short, a laptop is an ergonomic nightmare. (I can also argue that a <i>desktop</i> computer is an ergonomic nightmare for children and other small people, but this page is about laptops.) Then there's the weight. How old are these children before they're expected to lug the laptop in a backpack or carrying case? Plus, keep in mind that books, worksheets, posters, and \"manipulatives\" are easier on the eye than a screen full of pixels no matter what a person's age. They're easier to read than a screen, and the reader is less likely to go nearsighted.",

Then there's the ever changing software in addition to the usual material that the school is trying to teach. Some \"skills\" like drag-and-drop will be useful for another decade, but others will need to be learned and unlearned every couple years or each semester with the software that comes along. Plus, the harried teacher needs to keep on top of the technology ball and figure out how to use whatever \"educational\" software and equipment get tossed at him/her by the higher-ups. One can argue that money is better spent on items that never go obsolete: books, paper, pencils, crayons, scissors, glue, balls, jump ropes, musical instruments, <i>teachers, classrooms, lunches</i>.",

For example, a child might be taught in the classroom that the Earth rotates, orbits around the Sun and that the Moon orbits around the Earth. Visualising this might be difficult at first, but making a simulation is easy; draw the Earth, Moon and Sun, put the Earth and Moon inside a container, then use the simple Logo programs \"Container forward 20; right 1\" to orbit the Sun, \"Moon forward 5; right 12\" to orbit the Earth and \"Earth right 60\" to make the Earth spin. By putting a dot on the edge of the Earth to represent an observer, it becomes much more intuitive to see what comes into and out of the observer's line of sight over the course of a day, a month and a year. Then, with a computer to hand, it becomes much easier to persue \"what if\" questions, which can often be a great way to gain insight and test your own understanding of a subject.",

        "text": "First, and easiest, let's consider the physical aspects. A laptop screen is at the correct ergonomic height for no-one but a toddler. If you're taller than 3 feet, your posture is toast when using a laptop. Unless, of course, the laptop is on a table that's too high for comfortable keyboarding. Either way, you're hosed. So, laptops teach lousy posture or dangerous keyboard use. If the laptop opens up 180 degrees, the kid's best bet might be to loll on his tummy and poke at the keyboard and mouse pad with one hand. But that probably means the kid's eyes are aimed too high for comfort. In short, a laptop is an ergonomic nightmare. (I can also argue that a <i>desktop</i> computer is an ergonomic nightmare for children and other small people, but this page is about laptops.) Then there's the weight. How old are these children before they're expected to lug the laptop in a backpack or carrying case? Plus, keep in mind that books, worksheets, posters, and \"manipulatives\" are easier on the eye than a screen full of pixels no matter what a person's age. They're easier to read than a screen, and the reader is less likely to go nearsighted.",

Then there's the ever changing software in addition to the usual material that the school is trying to teach. Some \"skills\" like drag-and-drop will be useful for another decade, but others will need to be learned and unlearned every couple years or each semester with the software that comes along. Plus, the harried teacher needs to keep on top of the technology ball and figure out how to use whatever \"educational\" software and equipment get tossed at him/her by the higher-ups.
