      "text": "SDM’s read and write operations have non trivial connectivity requirements described in [13, 15]. Every neuron must: (i) know to fire if it is within d Hamming distance of an input; (ii) uniquely update each element of its storage vector when writing in a new pattern; (iii) output its storage vector during reading using shared output lines so that all neuron outputs can be summed together. Unique architectural features of the cerebellar cortex can implement all of these requirements, specifically via the three way convergence between granule cells, climbing fibers and Purkinje cells: (i) all granule cells receive inputs from the same mossy fibers to check if they are within d of the incoming query or pattern; (ii) each granule cell has a very long parallel fiber that stores memories in synapses with thousands of Purkinje cells [43], updated by LTP/LTD (Long Term Potentiation/Depression) from joint firing with climbing fibers; (iii) all granule cells output their stored memories via their synapses to the Purkinje cells that perform the summation operation and use their firing threshold to determine if the majority bit was a 1 or 0, outputting the new query [13, 15]. Moreover, the Drosophila mushroom body is highly similar to the cerebellum and the previous cell labels for each function can be replaced with Kenyon cells, dopaminergic neurons, and mushroom body output neurons, respectively [17]. While SDM fits the unique features of the cerebellum well, this connection has limitations. Explanations for some of the original model’s limitations have been put forward to account for sparse dendritic connections of Granule cells [44] and the functions of at least two of the three inhibitory interneurons: Golgi, Stellate and Basket cells [29, 45]. However, there are futher challenges that remain, including better explanations of the inputs to the mossy and climbing fibers and outputs from the Purkinje cells; in particular, how the mossy and climbing fiber inputs synchronize for the correct spike time dependent plasticity [46]. Another phenomenon that SDM does not account for is the ability of Purkinje cells to store the time intervals associated with memories [47]. Further research is necessary to update the state of SDM’s biological plausibility with modern neuroscientific findings."
