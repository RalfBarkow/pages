In the [[Structured Programming]] Age, all the commands were toward the machine: (You = machine) doThisTo blob with param1. Now with [[Object Oriented Programming]], we are making orders not directly to the machine but to imaginary objects we made from problem domains: blob should(or will) doThis with param1. Notice the change in the word order. This is a great paradigm shift; from verb-centric to noun-centric. -- [[June Kim]]</i>",

Of course, what is considered \"unnecessary\" itself can trigger a holy war. For example, I think good repetition factoring would remove the \"dot path\" from many function/method calls, but some like the dots ([[Responsibility Driven Design Conflicts With Yagni]]). I have never met anybody who proposed that <b>all</b> repetition be removed, so the disagreement is where and how much.",
