Concurrent rewriting coincides with logical deduction in conditional rewriting logic, [[a logic of actions]] whose models are concurrent systems. This logic is sound and complete and has initial models. In addition to general models interpreted as concurrent systems which provide a more operational style of semantics, more restricted semantics with an incresingly denotational flavor such as preorder, poset, cpo, and standard algebraic models appear as special cases of the model theory.
