The latter summoned the defendants to a certain date and appointed a local lawyer named Barthelemy Chassenee as defense counsel. In his plea, Chassenee invoked a number of obscure and long-forgotten authors. In addition, he pointed to several significant anathemas in the Old and New Testaments: God's cursing of the serpent in the Garden of Eden; the law of Exodus, which states that an ox that spears a man or woman is to be stoned and its flesh is not to be eaten; Jesus' curse against the barren fig tree of Bethany; and, finally, the story of the pigs of Gadara. Chassenee further cited Virgil, Ovid, Cicero, Aristotle, Gregory the Great, Justinian's Institutions, Moses, various patristic theologians, and Pico della Mirandola. He recounted numerous examples of successful banishment curses imposed by medieval saints on sparrows, slugs, leeches, eels, and even an entire orchard. Based on compelling procedural arguments, the court finally decided, unable to determine a precise deadline within which the rats would have to appear, to suspend the proceedings indefinitely and pronounce judgment in favor of the rats who had not appeared. The rats had won the case."

Some of them were severely punished and burned at the stake; others were first scorched and strangled before their bodies were burned. Often the condemned animal was buried alive. In Austria, a dog was punished by one year in prison. In Russia, towards the end of the seventeenth century, a billy goat was banished to Siberia. Pigs convicted of murder were usually thrown into the dungeon until the day of execution; they were thereby confined to the same prisons and kept in the same conditions as human offenders."

Or is it only law that exploits nature with the recognition of new rights of action in order to increase its norm production? These developments are indeed changing the quality of legal subjectivity and the environmental relations of law. The ecological movement has put anew on the agenda the question of which \"living\" entities can claim actor status in law and politics. But who are these new actors in political ecology? Environmental protection associations as a kind of trustee of nature still represent the simplest cases of \"new\" actors. The actor status of future generations is more difficult to assess. Even more difficult is that of animals or animal species, of plants or even of entire landscapes. And what about languages and cultures?"

Does Artificial Intelligence produce new spiritual entities - the \"angels\" of our present - in the world of information processing? Are electronic agents that initiate and settle economic transactions via complex programs merely media of legal communication or do they autonomously \"decide\" on the conclusion of contracts? The problem is whether these new agents, who assert their interests or even fight for their basic rights, are ultimately nothing more than mere social movements that act on behalf of non-human entities and at the same time demand to be formally recognized as legal actors (anthropocentrism)? Or does society actually communicate with various autonomous processes in its environment in order to do justice to their intrinsic value (ecocentrism)? Or, at this point, are law and politics so coupled to \"living,\" \"pulsating,\" \"autonomous\" processes that they could steer their norm production in entirely new directions (juridicentrism or sociocentrism)?"

Does Artificial Intelligence produce new spiritual entities - the \"angels\" of our present - in the world of information processing? Are electronic agents that initiate and settle economic transactions via complex programs merely media of legal communication or do they autonomously \"decide\" on the conclusion of contracts? The problem is whether these new agents, who assert their interests or even fight for their basic rights, are ultimately nothing more than mere social movements that act on behalf of non-human entities and at the same time demand to be formally recognized as legal actors (anthropocentrism)? Or does society actually communicate with various autonomous processes in its environment in order to do justice to their intrinsic value (ecocentrism)? Or, at this point, are law and politics so coupled to \"living,\" \"pulsating,\" \"autonomous\" processes that they could steer their norm production in entirely new directions (juridicentrism or sociocentrism)?"
