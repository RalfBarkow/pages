It may feel a bit dated (the [[Graphical User Interface]] is much like the original [[Be Os]], for example) but it is reliable and you can get from [[Boot Loader]] to desktop in under a second with a fast disk.  A [[Live Cd]] can be downloaded form the site, and it runs well in qemu and on actual hardware.",
