Given this situation, it might prove useful to follow through on the request for information and to respond in two letters, from Basel to Chicago and back. I do not associate this undertaking in any way with quarrels over chronological priority, since at this point it is quite obvious that we agree, despite our differing intellectual presuppositions and scientific goals, with the assessment that the image question touches on the foundations of culture and poses quite novel demands on the field that are not to be haphazardly satisfied. For the ‘image’ is not simply some new topic, but relates much more to a different mode of thinking, one that has shown itself capable of clarifying and availing itself of the long-neglected cognitive possibilities that lie in non-verbal representation."
