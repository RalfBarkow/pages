But it is already questionable what weight majority relationships have. Comparing the two groups reveals a difference that is much more essential: the privileged have the greater chance of organizing quickly and effectively. Their common interest is not necessarily more intense, but more organizing.\n"

If I wish that a deck chair which I temporarily occupy should not be occupied by others in my absence, but voucher symbols are not recognized, there is only one thing I can do at first: ask another person to supervise it, to represent my claim. This other person, however, is in this first phase inevitably an also-lounger, my neighbor. Only he can have an interest in helping me. But his interest is also unusually fevident: first, he can hope that I will help him in the same situation, and second, every case in which a possessory claim achieves validity promotes its own chances. Mutual support, cooperation, thus imposes itself immediately. By helping the other, we help ourselves and the principle at the same time."

Cooperation is obvious: The possessors have something to offer each other directly: Substitution, protection, confirmation. Individual and common interest coincide.

The new recliners had to quickly figure out their need and ability to organize.\n\nThe situation of the non-owners is much more complicated. In themselves, the commonality of interests seems obvious here as well. But as soon as an attempt is made to translate it into action, it becomes questionable. The only thing that cannot be doubted is the interest in ousting the propertied classes. But this first step is problematized from the second. What should happen if a common action would be successful? How will the newly conquered deck chairs be disposed of? The expectation of driving out the possessors does not give any security for the individual to achieve anything for himself. The agreement that the existing order is unjust does not yet create an agreement as to which new order would be just. Agreement that the existing order is just, on the other hand, equates agreement as to what new order would be just with – namely, none.\n"

However, this obvious solution is at the same time the most difficult and the most improbable one under the given circumstances. The one-time recapture of the deck chairs would by no means be sufficient to enforce the principle of inheritance as long as the opposing group insists on its claims. They could occupy and defend the deck chairs again and again. In the free competition of the two designs of order, the advocates of the pure right of use would have to assert themselves anew each time against fixed claims of ownership, while they, for their part, would release the deck chairs after use without conflict. Consequently, the conflict situation would manifest itself every time they were the have-nots. \"Free competition\" would mean nothing else for them than that they could be constantly maneuvered back into the situation of the attacker and disturber of the peace – with nothing more in their hands than their principle. The conclusion is not new: The representatives of the cooperative egalitarian principle can only prevail if they assert themselves radically. Either they must succeed in suppressing possessive thinking in such a way that it cannot practically come into effect – the \"re-education\" – or they must form a closed society in which the others do not participate, are excluded from the right of use. The result is that strange compulsion to intolerance which seems to be inherent in a certain conception of order, but which arises merely from the relationship between two conceptions of order. Rules of free competition inevitably create unequal chances for the conflict of these ideas of order. Those who are against \"having\" cannot compete freely with those who want to have."

But if the dispossessed attack haphazardly or only with the intention of turning the tables, then the problem of redistribution arises immediately and predictably for everyone. As soon as some of the hitherto dispossessed sit on the newly conquered deck chairs (as soon as some of the landless have staked out the occupied land for themselves), they are faced with the question of whether they cannot personally consider the distribution problem settled and thus the action completed. The idea of non-possession, of the pure right of use, has probably lost its innocence by now. But it is not enough for everyone anyway. The first success thus separates the attackers into groups with at least latently different interests. This difficulty of holding out immediately after the first occupation, however, is only the beginning of a chain of similar conflict situations. Their common core is the fact that the attackers bring the distribution problem, which the defenders have solved for themselves, into the conflict. They inherit it, as it were, from the status quo they are fighting."

Mutual aid – cooperation in conflict actions – does not yet ensure individual success. Cohesion is not immediately rewarded for the individual; commonality initially means only a gamble. What the dispossessed really have to offer each other is decided only later. Solidarity is therefore dependent on all participants orienting themselves towards the next but one phase. The willingness to organize must be constituted not on a momentary advantage, but on a distant goal, not on the real, but on the imaginary deck chair. It can be founded only on a speculative confidence, on a speculative solidarity, – an incomparably much higher achievement than is expected of the privileged.\n\n"

The mere willingness to act – the \"determination to act\" – does not achieve the balance. The solidarity-based willingness to act with staying power that is necessary for this obviously requires above all a \"disproportionality\" of objectives and hopes. Utopia (in the sense of this \"disproportionality\") seems to be the realistic method to meet the speculative character of the required solidarity.

They rule not least because they are superior in this way, and because they rule they can constantly reproduce and possibly further extend this superiority. There are, of course, countervailing processes as well: For example, what we call \"democratization\" today is essentially the product of an organizational capacity of the basic class, quite exceptional by historical standards, which emerged anew in the course of industrialization. To inquire into the reasons for such gradual changes is a task in itself. In our case it turns out that the \"additional chance\" of the superior organizational ability already arises in the status nascendi of a power formation: The new group initially possessed nothing but the instantaneous de facto disposition of a general commodity and laid claim to exclusive and permanent power of disposition: this seemingly razor-thin advantage was sufficient for the formation of a superior organizational capacity, – and thus for the beginning of a process of accumulation of power against the interests of the majority.\n"

This later phase will be examined in more detail following the second and third examples. Here we shall first be interested in a phenomenon which can already be observed in the beginning of the formation of power and which also contributes to the explanation of the absurd assertiveness of the new group: a process which one could call the generatio aequivoca of legitimacy.\n"

With the degree of legitimacy, therefore, the chance of behavior conforming to the order or to the rule increases. Now Max Weber sees this legitimation always in a social vertical, as it were: as a relationship from bottom to top or from top to bottom. The rulers make a legitimacy claim downward, the ruled address a legitimacy belief upward. This is a useful simplification for representing formed legitimacy structures. But it can mislead if one asks about the emergence of the legitimacy regime, about the first discernible traces of this process.\n\nOn our ship, a new order gradually developed that privileged a particular group. For whom did this new order first become legitimate, how did a legitimacy rule form here? The answer is as simple as the question. Initially, this order appeared legitimate to the privileged themselves. But not simply in the sense that each of them believed in himself, in his own claims and well-acquired rights. Rather, recognition took place according to the principle of reciprocity in a process of exchange among the privileged. This is decisive. Just as they helped each other out of evident interest in defending their claims, so they helped each other in building up their convincingly good conscience: I recognize not only my claim, but also the claim of the other who recognizes mine. – Because I acknowledge the other, I am in the right; because the other acknowledges me, he is in the right. – Because the other recognizes me as I recognize him, and I him as he recognizes me, our claims are grounded in our right.\n"

Two classes had established themselves, the haves and the have-nots, the positively and the negatively privileged. If one compares these two new subgroups with the totality of passengers who had participated in the earlier order, it immediately becomes apparent that what was really original about the new order – at least in its first phase – was the establishment of negative privileges. One subgroup was denied access to a commodity. The privileged subgroup, on the other hand, could use this good as needed, that is, just as everyone had before. Assuming that their needs remained the same, they had not yet gained any advantage over the former entirety. The enviable aspect of their situation lay in the fact that they did not belong to the others. Further however above all in the expandability of its position. It takes little imagination to predict the further course of events if the journey continued for a while under the same conditions.\n\n"

Mutual aid - cooperation in conflict actions - does not yet ensure individual success. Cohesion is not immediately rewarded for the individual; commonality initially means only a gamble. What the dispossessed really have to offer each other is decided only later. Solidarity is therefore dependent on all participants orienting themselves towards the next but one phase. The willingness to organize must be constituted not on a momentary advantage, but on a distant goal, not on the real, but on the imaginary deck chair. It can be founded only on a speculative confidence, on a speculative solidarity, - an incomparably much higher achievement than is expected of the privileged.\n\nBut the formation of such trust is further complicated by specific opportunities for manipulation on the part of the privileged. The privileged are able to constantly compete the hope of future benefits with the offer of present benefits: in the form of material rewards for service and loyalty, opportunities for relative individual advancement.

As is well known, the strong conviction that something is right and just is enormously contagious anyway; if this conviction emanates from groups, as a certainty that has already become social, the power of suggestion is intensified. This does not necessarily presuppose that the group explicitly appeals to others, that it turns outward in a demanding manner. The suggestive power of agreement already works when the internal mutual recognition process becomes visible, observable for others: for example, in the demonstrative ceremonial of the privileged, which \"pretends\" legitimacy, symbolized in a representational behavior (forms of greeting, clothing, gestures of recognition with their prefigurative effect)."

This is another peculiar additional opportunity that arises for its actors already in the first phases of the formation of power: the internal construction of that consciousness that offers motives of docility beyond habit and interest. Here, too, a power potency accumulates as if by itself."

It can also - as the last vestige preserved by an old order - long outlast the de facto collapse of \"its\" order. The European nobility is a clear example. Here, too, the remnants of a legitimacy validity are still preserved above all in the internal exchange process of recognition. This process of exchange develops a continuing force of its own. In the last as in the first stage, it seems to radiate a certain suggestive effect to the outside, rather than being dependent on external confirmations."
