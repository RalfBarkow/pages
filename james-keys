The central category of a love that can only be won in pairs opposes logical analysis without being able to absorb and include it. The distinction of man and woman is thus stripped of its character as a distinction in the sense of Spencer Brown's logic – hence probably the pseudonym! –, without its theoretical place being determined. Behind this seems to be the idea that there is this one distinction that eludes the operational logic of \"draw a distinction!\". A distinction that does not distinguish but merges? A paradox? If [[Women's Studies]] wanted to connect here, it would take the ground out of their rather loveless practice, without it being immediately obvious where this would lead."
