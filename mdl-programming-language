      "text": "MDL provides several enhancements to classic Lisp.  It supports several built-in data types, including lists, strings and arrays, and user-defined data types.  It offers [[Thread (computing)]] expression evaluation and [[coroutine]]s. [[Variable (computer science)]]s can carry both a local value within a scope, and a global value, for passing data between scopes. Advanced built-in functions supported interactive [[debugging]] of MDL programs, incremental [[Software development]], and reconstruction of source programs from object programs."

      "text": "Although MDL is obsolete, some of its features have been incorporated in later versions of Lisp.  Gerald Sussman went on to develop the [[Scheme (programming language)]] language, in collaboration with [[Guy Steele]], who later wrote the specifications for [[Common Lisp]] and [[Java (programming language)]].  Carl Hewitt had already published the idea for the language ''[[Planner (programming language)]]'' before the MDL project began, but his subsequent thinking on Planner reflected lessons learned from building MDL.  Planner concepts influenced languages such as [[Prolog]] and [[Smalltalk]]. Smalltalk and [[Simula]], in turn, influenced Hewitt's future work on the [[actor model]]."

      "text": "But the largest influence that MDL had was on the [[software]] genre of [[interactive fiction]] (IF).  An IF game named [[Zork]], sometimes called Dungeon, was first written in MDL. Later, Reeve, Daniels, Galley and other members of Dynamic Modeling went on to start [[Infocom]], a company that produced many early [[Commercial software]] works of interactive fiction."
