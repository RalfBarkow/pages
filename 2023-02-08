But one must not forget the standards. The \"Morgenlandfahrt,\" for example, stands up to much of what is in vogue today. The man can write, and the book is really dense. (Bergengruen's novellas - \"The Sultan's Rose and Other Tales\" - are also dense and well written. Must all writers be revolutionaries? I found it soothing to read these things again. What disturbs one is probably the very thing that makes them attractive to other people: the constant hinting at mysterious profundity that is supposed to lie behind them."

To account for the inevitable variety of cases and contexts, legal arguments are “typically vague and ambiguous,” and legal communication must be “susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation.” The task of lawyers—as Garfinkel claims—is to make ambiguous the interpretations of facts and laws. For algorithms, however, ambiguity is notoriously a challenge. Machines not only struggle with understanding the ambiguity of human communication, they struggle harder to generate ambiguous communication—that is, to use in competent ways the ambiguity required by legal arguments."

This chapter aims to present the discussion on intelligence-gathering by introducing electronic and open source intelligence both in the public and the private domain. It discusses cyberspace and the increasing use of data bases and on-line information systems in law enforcement and the business community. The chapter also aims to attempt cyberspies involved in economic and industrial espionage, hackers and electronic infiltration and more generally the discussion on infowars or cyberwars. It deals with regard to the social impact of the new intelligence-gathering techniques; the political consequences and the academic challenges these new developments pose for a scientific community predominantly occupied with the most visible form of intelligence-gathering: humint. There is an evident need to broaden the discussion on concepts like proactive methods, surveillance, intelligence, privacy and democratic control. Technical intelligence and open source intelligence go far beyond anything Sun Tzu could have imagined.\n"

He was introduced to it by his friend and colleague Silja Samerski, who was studying the genetic counseling that is mandatory in Germany for pregnant women considering genetic testing - a topic she would later write about in a book titled The Decision Trap (Imprint - Academic, 2015). Genetic testing during pregnancy does not tell us anything precise about the child the woman being tested is expecting. It merely detects markers whose uncertain meaning can be expressed in probabilities - a probability calculated over the entire population to which the woman being tested belongs, by age, family history, ethnicity, etc. For example, when she is told that there is a 30% chance that her baby will have this or that syndrome, she is told nothing about herself or the fruit of her womb - she is told only what might happen to someone like her. She knows no more about her actual situation than what her hopes, dreams, and intuitions reveal, but the risk profile identified for her statistical double demands a decision."

In an initialization step, which lasts a couple of seconds, this model is fit to the 3D shape parameters of the people as observed in the depth data. Then, a succession of pose tracking, body segmentation, shape deformation and image warping steps are performed – in real-time and independently for multiple people. We present a variety of results in the paper and the video, showing the interactive virtual mirror cabinet experience."

        "text": "> It is communication that must work, and it is not simple. How can the fundamental ambiguity of legal argumentation be reproduced in communication with algorithms? To account for the inevitable variety of cases and contexts, legal arguments are “typically vague and ambiguous,” and legal communication must be “susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation.” The task of lawyers—as Garfinkel claims—is to make ambiguous the interpretations of facts and laws. For algorithms, however, ambiguity is notoriously a challenge. Machines not only struggle with understanding the ambiguity of human communication, they struggle harder to generate ambiguous communication—that is, to use in competent ways the ambiguity required by legal arguments."

This chapter aims to present the discussion on intelligence-gathering by introducing electronic and open source intelligence both in the public and the private domain. It discusses cyberspace and the increasing use of data bases and on-line information systems in law enforcement and the business community. The chapter also aims to attempt cyberspies involved in economic and industrial espionage, hackers and electronic infiltration and more generally the discussion on infowars or cyberwars. It deals with regard to the social impact of the new intelligence-gathering techniques; the political consequences and the academic challenges these new developments pose for a scientific community predominantly occupied with the most visible form of intelligence-gathering: humint. There is an evident need to broaden the discussion on concepts like proactive methods, surveillance, intelligence, privacy and democratic control. Technical intelligence and open source intelligence go far beyond anything Sun Tzu could have imagined.\n"
