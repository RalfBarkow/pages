Either I can say I want to see through the problem. Or I can say to myself, I'm not going to live very long, behind this problem there are a whole bunch of others. What I'm interested in is finding a way to eliminate the problem if I act on it. This second point of view was previously considered the 'primitive' – magical – point of view. Now suddenly it does a somersault, and it becomes the rational point of view. Suddenly it turns out to be more rational to leave the problem unresolved and to solve it unresolved. I haven't really wrapped my head around this cybernetic attitude yet, but there is something religious about leaving the mystery in mystery. The fact that we no longer have to analyze, but leave the analysis to the computer, and that we can be content to solve the problems, is both an impoverishment and an enrichment. I am not yet clear whether the impoverishment or the enrichment is greater. Because the beauty of analysis, that is, the beauty of critical reason is a powerful argument after all. We lose the beauty of critical thinking and gain the beauty of the new imagination. I can't weigh that.\""
