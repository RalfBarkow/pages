Wardley's original example of a Classical Greek era battle as one where paths and strategic chokepoints in the territory were important seemed to be one example of things to look for in a putative Wardley map in order to ask \"is this a map, where paths and loci make sense?\".\nWardley's summary judgments about questions which others might think are still in some question (cloud computing, the decline of the West and rise of China) might be more dispositional and personal, than related to mapping.\nI'll be out to breakfast with friends during Sunday Pioneers. See folks soon!\n"
