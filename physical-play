Notably, early childhood is a fertile ground to cultivate young people’s interest in computing and promote their development of social, emotional, and cognitive skills [6, 12, 32, 36]. However, learning to code is challenging because 1) coding involves abstract concepts and ways of thinking that are not intuitive for beginners, and 2) many learning experiences are structured and delivered in ways that may not be productive for learners [14, 26, 44]. Much research, therefore, has been focused on introducing coding to children in engaging and personally meaningful ways [15, 52]."
