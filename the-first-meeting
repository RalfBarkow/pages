Some would say that I’ve been in the right place at the right time, met the right people and made good connections. I’ve also worked ridiculously hard; as you know too, being a teacher is a labour of love. Mostly, I think I've been fortunate to connect with people who want the best for me. Those who have looked at me with Believing Eyes, provided the space to be seen and heard; those who have pushed me to grow, to transform myself. The grandest of all opportunities was presented to me in 2015, the chance to partner with others to open a brand-new school. \n"

A time when I began to explore and question if there was another way. What I didn’t realise at the beginning of our Griffin journey was how transformative it would be for me, not only professionally but personally. The impact of being seen and heard still as powerful as an adult, as it was for me as a child."
