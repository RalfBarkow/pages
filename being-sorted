In Year 4 I tried to avoid writing at every turn evidenced by one time walking across the road from my house and stuffing my 'composition book' down a stormwater drain. I thought this would mean I would have an excuse. Rather, in the school my mother taught at, I sat in the principal's office for many afternoons after the other kids has gone home, rewriting all the compositions my book contained."

The sorting, now for university entrance, limited post school course options for me. I was ashamed of my results. I hide these results, and the lasting shame, still today. But the evidence should be otherwise."

Perhaps because I was so young, I didn't meet the school's expectations. My 'D' grades resulting in me repeating Grade 2. The message I internalised as my friends advanced to Grade 3 was I wasn't a learner, I couldn't read and couldn't write. Learning was no longer fun, but a chore. I had been sorted."
