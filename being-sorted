The system can shame quickly, turning learning from a natural joy into a [[Fear of Failure]]. One practice meant to assist a 'failing child' was to have them 'repeat' a grade. We now know this practice has negative impacts. In fact, an effect size of - 0.16 means it is one of the few things we do in the name of learning that actually disadvantages a child."

Perhaps because I was so young, I didn't meet [[School Expectations]]. My 'D' grades resulting in me repeating Grade 2. The message I internalised as my friends advanced to Grade 3 was I wasn't a learner, I couldn't read and couldn't write. Learning was no longer fun, but a chore. I had been sorted."

In Year 4 I tried to avoid writing at every turn evidenced by one time walking across the road from my house and stuffing my 'composition book' down a storm water drain.

I was a [[Compliant Learner]]; quiet, well behaved, hardly noticeable in the classroom or playground."
