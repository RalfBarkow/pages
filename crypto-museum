It explores how the technology might forge new connections between the museum, the collection, and audiences by binding personalised experiences about NML objects to NFT versions of these objects.

      "text": "This thesis argues that the process of creating NFTs from a museum’s collection is a process of pseudo fragmenting the work which simulates the effects of ownership and authenticity. The simulated effect of these conditions provides the owner with control over their token because it can be exchanged or traded, which challenges traditional institutional authority over its digital collections. This also has the potential to forge a new relation between the participant and the museum that can be understood as shared guardianship or a feeling of enchainment. In turn, this thesis proposes that this can create social value for museums. However, ultimately, building enchainment is contingent on a triad of relations between the technology, the museum, and the participant, whereby these different aspects interact with each other to produce value in the digital object."
