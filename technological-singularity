According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, I.J. Good's intelligence explosion model, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a \"runaway reaction\" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an \"explosion\" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.

Available from: https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA449385 War theorists believe we have entered into a new generation of warfare where an evolved form of insurgency uses all available networks - political economic social military - to convince the enemys decision makers that their strategic goals are either unachievable or too costly for the perceived benefit. They have named this new era of war fourth generation warfare. Currently the Department of Defenses intelligence strategy is designed to defeat conventional adversaries vise a fourth generation warfare opponent. To be successful against a fourth generation warfare opponent the Department of Defense must transform its intelligence efforts. It must shift collection efforts from high-technology to low-technology solutions redefine intelligence indicators increase processing and analysis capabilities and develop more agile dissemination systems. In addition the Department must develop a holistic strategy to fight and win a fourth generation war. This project will discuss the theory of fourth generation warfare and highlight its distinct characteristics. The study then identifies the challenges faced by the intelligence community as a result of this new form a war. Finally recommendations will be provided to enhance intelligence support to the military in their effort to win a fourth generation war.\n"

In addition the Department must develop a holistic strategy to fight and win a fourth generation war. This project will discuss the theory of fourth generation warfare and highlight its distinct characteristics.
