In image-based rendering (IBR), a set of real images of the scene is used to build a novel view. According to the knowledge about scene geometry, [2] proposes the following classification: rendering with no geometry, rendering with explicit geometry and rendering with implicit geometry. Rendering with no geometry i.e. no calibration is used to create a mosaic from a set of local views that leads to a novel global view [3], [4]. Rendering with explicit geometry i.e. with strong calibration is close to MBR. Its purpose is the reconstruction of a 3D view from real views of the scene [5]. This technique needs a strong calibration and is computationally expensive. "
