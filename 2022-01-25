Lots of developers don't like the P(hp) in LAMP either :)\nAnd I feel pretty productive with Pharo/GT + Fossil + TW. I think that stack names, when \"sticky\", help to spread the ideas embodied on the stack. But when I coined \"pocket infrastructures\" (in an academic context, instead of a development one) I was trying to signal something different about how, when choosing infrastructure, we're choosing by action or omission the people who will use it.\n\nIf the digital infrastructure is something always online, browser/web native, big data, machine training oriented, (that I use instead of machine\"learning\") and all that shiny terms (coming usually from the Global North), we are going to pick the people who has \"proper\" connectivity and machines to run the shiny terminology powered stuff. When the criteria about infrastructure is that it should be able to run in stuff that has the processing/storage power that fits your pocket/backpack, there is an implicit assumption about who will be able to run the infrastructure, hopefully a more diverse and plural one."

My \"pocket infrastructures powered\" stack was orders of magnitude simpler/cheaper that the one used by the International Council of Investigative Journalists. Granted, they already cleaned the data and made the research. But for distributing the results, the alternative approach using pocket infrastructures was more resilient, interactive and inviting. (But not web native, \"machine learned\" or whatever). There is still a gap to bridge and decades of work to make technology more empowering for more people.

Some call it the \"Californian (acritical) techno-optimism\", because of the Silicon Valley popularized (naive) approach of \"solving\" the complex problems created by technology by adding more technology. That echoes the felling of change your current stack with this other (that helps in a pretty specific place but is not enough). Critical approaches to technology are sparse. I would put there the works of \"Data Feminism\", by D'Ignacio and Klein, \"Big Data from the South\", by Stefania Milan and others and the Tierra Comun collective on Data Colonialism. \n"

In other words, it is trained not to guess that it is seeing a photo of a dog when it sees a dog, but to guess what the teacher would see when he sees that picture. Since the student network is not trying to guess the actual picture, but the teacher's representation of that picture, the algorithm does not have to be tailored to a specific type of input.

Thinking about which laws are possible or impossible may generate an alternative way of providing explanations, and therefore new scientific theories.\n\nIn this talk, Chiara is in-conversation with Marcus du Sautoy to explain this fascinating, far-reaching approach (known as Constructor Theory) which holds promise for revolutionising the way fundamental physics is formulated and for providing essential tools to face existing technological challenges, from delivering the next generation of information-processing devices beyond the universal quantum computer to designing AIs.\n\nChiara Marletto is a Research Fellow working at the Physics Department, University of Oxford. Within Wolfson, she is an active member of the Quantum Cluster and of the New Frontiers Quantum Hub.\n\nHer research is in theoretical physics, with special emphasis on Quantum Theory of Computation, Information Theory, Thermodynamics, Condensed-Matter Physics and Quantum Biology. Some of her recent research has harnessed a recently proposed generalisation of the quantum theory of information — Constructor Theory — to address issues at the foundations of the theory of control and causation in physics. These include applications to defining general principles encompassing classical, quantum and post-quantum theories of information; and to assessing the compatibility of essential features of living systems, such as the ability to self-reproduce and evolve, with fundamental laws of Physics, in particular with Quantum Physics. They also include the definition of a new class of witnesses of non-classicality in systems that need not obey quantum theory, such as gravity; and a scale-independent definition of irreversibility, work and heat, based on constructor-theoretic ideas. \n\nMarcus du Sautoy is the Charles Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at the Oxford University, a chair he holds jointly at the Department of Continuing Education and the Mathematical Institute. He is also a Professor of Mathematics and a Fellow of New College. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2016. In 2006 he gave the CHRISTMAS LECTURES, entitled THE NUM8ER MY5TERIES.\n\nThis talk was filmed on 27 May 2021."

I am finding the \"one size fits all\" LePage with \"has-a\" type awkward, especially if you want to harness the moldable benefits of GT. There seem to be too many levels of indirection to get at the interesting objects. For example, to get custom views and inspector snippets, you have to either add them all to LePage, whether generally relevant or not, or constantly click through to a second object (the type).\n2. I also suspect there are different classes of \"types\". Where the current mechanism might make some sense for types that can be converted one to another e.g. unnamed to named, there are cases, including mine (Transcript/notes belonging to specific instances of certain types of domain objects), where this isn't logical and so the benefits of the current scheme are unclear.\n3. To make the current mechanism work cleanly, a way to add pages types to those known to the target DB must be exposed. Currently, if a page type is created, the following hack must be done to avoid error:"

My \"pocket infrastructures powered\" stack was orders of magnitude simpler/cheaper that the one used by the International Council of Investigative Journalists. Granted, they already cleaned the data and made the research. But for distributing the results, the alternative approach using pocket infrastructures was more resilient, interactive and inviting. (But not web native, \"machine learned\" or whatever). There is still a gap to bridge and decades of work to make technology more empowering for more people.

In other words, it is trained not to guess that it is seeing a photo of a dog when it sees a dog, but to guess what the teacher would see when he sees that picture. Since the student network is not trying to guess the actual picture, but the teacher's representation of that picture, the algorithm does not have to be tailored to a specific type of input. So it works with text generation as well."

Some of her recent research has harnessed a recently proposed generalisation of the quantum theory of information — Constructor Theory — to address issues at the foundations of the theory of control and causation in physics. These include applications to defining general principles encompassing classical, quantum and post-quantum theories of information; and to assessing the compatibility of essential features of living systems, such as the ability to self-reproduce and evolve, with fundamental laws of Physics, in particular with Quantum Physics. They also include the definition of a new class of witnesses of non-classicality in systems that need not obey quantum theory, such as gravity; and a scale-independent definition of irreversibility, work and heat, based on constructor-theoretic ideas. \n\nMarcus du Sautoy is the Charles Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at the Oxford University, a chair he holds jointly at the Department of Continuing Education and the Mathematical Institute.
