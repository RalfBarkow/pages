Referring to Nietzsche, he is concerned with explaining singularities from a multiplicity of interactions and strategies even if this multiplicity is only historical and thus always only given with surpluses.

The genealogy of a singularity, according to Foucault, results from the entanglement of process maintenance and process transformation. Compared to the singularity, the process is that general to which a theoretical knowledge can refer, whose question then is: \"How can the insolubility of knowledge and power in the play of multiple interactions and strategies lead to singularities that fix themselves by virtue of their conditions of acceptability, and at the same time to a field of possible openings and indecisions, of possible reversals and shifts that make them fragile and impermanent, which turn those effects into events, no more and no less than events?\"\n"

Vogl is interested in \"a political decision-making power that operates apart from popular sovereignties and bypasses democratic procedures. In the course of the last three hundred years, it has taken on the character of a 'fourth power' in which the formation of capital power cannot be separated from the activation of power capitals. The current dominance of the financial regime is thus understood as the latest manifestation of an economization of governance, which manifests itself in aggressive couplings between political structures and private capital, in the efficient linking of market and power. The notorious juxtaposition of economics and politics proves to be a legend of liberalism and is not sufficient to grasp the genesis and shape of modern exercises of power\" (p. 8)."

This story begins with the Genoese monetary fairs of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, reaches its next two high points in the formation of first the Dutch and then the English maritime and financial powers, and presumably does not end with the emergence of the U.S.-Atlantic Federal Reserve System and the European Central Bank. Vogl can draw on a rich and well-documented literature on economic history, but draws his most important punchlines not only from the founding histories of such famous institutions as the Casa di San Giorgio in Genoa (est. 1407), the Wisselbank in Amsterdam (est. 1609), the Bank of London (est. 1694) and, less famously, the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Chilean central bank refounding after the 1973 coup against Allende, but also from extensive intellectual debates about these foundations, the most famous of which (at least since J.G.A. Pocock's book The Machiavellian Moment) has certainly been the debate about public credit as conducted by Daniel Defoe and others around the Bank of London.\n"
