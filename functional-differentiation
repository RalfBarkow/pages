        "text": "The classical theory of power assumed separate, contradictory structures of [[Need]], i.e. social differentiation. It regarded differentiation as a found, naturally existing source of [[Conflict]] and thus as a cause for the development of power. This view could be considered adequate as long as the principle of segmenting differentiation prevailed in the world, i.e. a form of differentiation that placed approximately equal units next to each other: Families, tribes, states, societies. In the course of the development of civilization, however, these are increasingly being replaced by another, more efficient form of differentiation according to specific functions, which enables the creation of much more complex systems.129 [[Functional Differentiation]] forces the formation of ever more comprehensive social systems. These form subsystems according to specific functions, which in turn can neither be equal nor self-sufficient in relation to each other. "
