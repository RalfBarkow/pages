The code first defines the rules for the automaton using an object called \"rules\" with keys representing patterns of three cells and values representing the resulting state of the middle cell in the next generation.\n\nThen, an initial state is defined as a string of 1's and 0's with a length of 9 characters. The \"next\" function takes this initial state and generates the next state according to the rules of the automaton. It does this by iterating through each group of three cells in the input state, using the \"slice\" method to extract the pattern of the three cells, and then looking up the corresponding value in the \"rules\" object to determine the value of the middle cell in the next generation. The resulting string of 1's and 0's is returned as the next state.\n\nThe code then creates an HTML canvas and uses the \"fillText\" method of the canvas context to draw the current state on the canvas. It repeats this process for 100 generations, each time updating the current state by calling the \"next\" function. The result is a visualization of the pattern generated by the Rule 90 automaton, with each row of the canvas representing a new generation of cells."
