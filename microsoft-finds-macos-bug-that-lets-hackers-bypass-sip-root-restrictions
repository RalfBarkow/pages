      "text": "Apple has patched a vulnerability discovered by Microsoft security researchers, dubbed Migraine, that would have allowed attackers with root privileges to install *undeleteable* malware and access the victim's private data. The researchers said, &#8220;By focusing on system processes that are signed by Apple and have the com.apple.rootless.install.heritable entitlement, we found two child processes that could be tampered with to gain arbitrary code execution in a security context that bypasses SIP [System Integrity Protection] checks.''  Bypassing SIP also would allow attackers to circumvent Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) policies to gain access the victim's private data. The vulnerability was patched in Apple's May 18 security updates for macOS Ventura 13.4, macOS Monterey 12.6.6, and macOS Big Sur 11.7.7."
