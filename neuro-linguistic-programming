As such, humans, and even all animals incl. insects and other animate or even inanimate beings have formed out their intelligence not only by application and exercise of the body but also by their ways of conversation, resulting in multiple-layered structures that intersect and finally form new structures that lead to recognition of the surrounding and perhaps the self. Yet, I also presume that the mind operates mostly in non-existence, and every thought is just on the brink of the event horizon of something even greater and finally forms from that same event horizon. As such, the mind is operating in singularity. How can one program a mind or even control singularity? Surely through exercise, but yet, we finally have to cope with said singularity in that we have to find thoughts where there are none. We have to make up ideas where there is nothing. And as such, the mind of all animate and inanimate beings, operate on that said Nothingness. How is your opinion to that? I mean, even the native americans knew of a ghost or even multiple ghosts or a hierarchy of ghosts that are within all of that exists and even all of that does not exist. And they also knew that, prior to semi-extinction, one can only find the true nature of one's self by also experiencing his or her body, as most of the intelligence does not lie in the brain but that every cell in one's body carries along as much intelligence as every specialized neuron in one's brain and that every cell in one's body accumulates to the intelligence that we try to measure.",

We find evolution in our brain, comparing it to the brains of for example birds and other higherly structured animals. Mankind is what we think to be the current superstructure of what we find in nature, not naturally the best structure but the brain was developed so that we could actually overcome the limitations of said animals. Yet, it also implicate selfishness and irresponsibility. And, society programs our brains as such that we become irresponsible. Now, programming the mind or the neurons that make up one's mind, is always a two-fold thing. First, one can program his or her brain by oneself or let it be programmed, aka mind-control. Yet, the mind also controls the functions of the body, as we found out not so long ago.

Yet, I also presume that the mind operates mostly in non-existence, and every thought is just on the brink of the event horizon of something even greater and finally forms from that same event horizon. As such, the mind is operating in singularity. How can one program a mind or even control singularity? Surely through exercise, but yet, we finally have to cope with said singularity in that we have to find thoughts where there are none. We have to make up ideas where there is nothing. And as such, the mind of all animate and inanimate beings, operate on that said Nothingness. How is your opinion to that? I mean, even the native americans knew of a ghost or even multiple ghosts or a hierarchy of ghosts that are within all of that exists and even all of that does not exist. And they also knew that, prior to semi-extinction, one can only find the true nature of one's self by also experiencing his or her body, as most of the intelligence does not lie in the brain but that every cell in one's body carries along as much intelligence as every specialized neuron in one's brain and that every cell in one's body accumulates to the intelligence that we try to measure.",

We find evolution in our brain, comparing it to the brains of for example birds and other higherly structured animals. Mankind is what we think to be the current superstructure of what we find in nature, not naturally the best structure but the brain was developed so that we could actually overcome the limitations of said animals. Yet, it also implicate selfishness and irresponsibility. And, society programs our brains as such that we become irresponsible.
