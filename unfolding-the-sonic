      "text": "Sound is never simply sound but always culturally induced, informed, and formatted. Much of the work in contemporary sound studies has pursued the analysis of the historical meanings with which sound was imbued or of implicit auditory knowledge. A complementary strand of research is inversely tackling the epistemic productivity of sound within culture. Guiding research questions such as ‘ How are sounds and listening constituted culturally?’ or ‘ What cultural meanings do sounds incorporate?’ are accompanied by reciprocal inquiries: ‘ How is culture constituted sonically?’ or ‘ In what ways are perception, thinking, and epistemic practices informed by sound?’ While sound serves as an abstract term for a physical as well as trivial description of acoustic vibrations, German scholars have proposed the term das Sonische, ‘the sonic’, as a more precise take on historical cultivations of sound in music, media, or human corporeality. We believe that this concept may serve as a viable vehicle for thinking about these chiastic vectors of entanglements of sound and culture together, without privileging one over the other."
