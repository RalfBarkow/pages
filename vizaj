However, real networks are often embedded in a geometrical space and the nodes code for an intrinsic physical feature of the system that one might want to preserve. For these spatial networks, it is therefore crucial to find alternative strategies operating on the links and not on the nodes. "

        "text": "In many fields of science and technology we are confronted with complex networks. Making sense of these networks often require the ability to visualize and explore their intermingled structure consisting of nodes and links. To facilitate the identification of significant connectivity patterns, many methods have been developed based on the rearrangement of the nodes so as to avoid link criss-cross. However, real networks are often embedded in a geometrical space and the nodes code for an intrinsic physical feature of the system that one might want to preserve. For these spatial networks, it is therefore crucial to find alternative strategies operating on the links and not on the nodes. "

Three.js is a GPU-accelerated 3D processing javascript language compiled with WebGL, a low-level graphics API designed specifically for the web. Notably, Vizaj is hosted online, which makes it usable on any machine through internet, and it runs standalone without relying on proprietary browser plugins. A dedicated graphical user interface (GUI) facilitates the interactive manipulation and creation of the visualization by the end user (Fig. 2). The whole process consists of three steps: i) the data import, ii) the network visualization, and iii) the export of the final outcome. A detailed guide is also provided in the [https://github.com/BCI-NET/vizaj github] page."

While optimized for 3D networks, Vizaj can also be used for 2D networks and offers the possibility to interactively customize the visualization via several controlling parameters, including network filtering and the effect of internode distance on the link trajectories. Vizaj is further equipped with additional options allowing to improve the final aesthetics, such as the color/size of both nodes and links, zooming/rotating/translating, and superimposing external objects.
