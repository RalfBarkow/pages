There is a bias toward small group computer-mediated communication, they argue, and even in geographically dispersed groups the technology tries to emulate the face-to-face model. Why should this be so? They point out that many human groups before groupware were not necessarily bounded or shaped in this way. The shapes and limitations of the technology have informed imaginations, first because of the limited bandwidth of early computer-mediated communication, and more recently because of the presumptions of objectoriented programming. The object-oriented approach incorporates some conservative assumptions about what is naturally human, including the inheritance of policy over time and a certain fixedness of roles. They note that the object-oriented abstraction process \"requires that each object be subject to and conform to the well-defined and explicitly stated rules, or ... a 'policy' of the problem domain,\" which may represent only one way of arranging groups with humans, that is perhaps overly dependent on industrial process modeling."

      "text": "How could this reconciliation occur? Rogers and Goguen concur that multiple memberships are key: People juggle identities as members of particular working or playing groups; they are simultaneously analysts and designers. Each group uses a language of information; sometimes one group \"desiccates\" the findings of another to make them more formal (and also more portable). Each of these activities is laden with values, decisions, and ethics, as the risk of a violating representation is always present. How to get good, respectful knowledge of working processes is not easy. Sometimes people cannot express what they do reflectively; and their very reliance on tacit knowledge limits the use of formal representations. As well, the multiplicity and temporal character of knowledge mean that all representations, in Goguen's words, \"leak.\" As with Sharrock and Button, Goguen turns to ethnomethodology for detailed studies of workplaces to, following the liquid metaphor, at least make the liquids more viscous. He discusses the use of discourse analysis and narrative. In all of these moves, the value-laden quality of the information is central."

      "text": "Sharrock and Button's chapter \"[[Engineering Investigations]]\" continues a long tradition of ethnomethodological studies of work. Ethnomethodology is a school of social science research that looks at how people accomplish everyday activities, often in great detail and based on empirical cases. It resists reified definitions of \"society\" or \"power\" or some of the traditional explanatory categories in favor of investigations that look at the dynamic processes involved in creating such categories. Engineers, they argue, are indeed surrounded by [[contingency]], which is the first thing many social scientists see when entering an engineering workplace for the first time."

When trying to understand these commonsense choices, sometimes it is necessary to clear away an underbrush of myth or overly rationalistic descriptions of how work is done. Throughout, Sharrock and Button focus on engineers as intelligent managers of contingencies, rather than victims or heroes. They maintain that \"the course of a technology development is thus a contest with contingencies, and the technology outcome is constituted by the wrestling with them on a day-to-day basis.\" Some of the contingencies take the form of trying to \"outthink the users,\" often involved as imaginary social types, such as the naive user or the key user, that nevertheless serve to organize the work. Work seen from this perspective is never a textbook perfect product; however, understanding the organizational reasons for less-than-perfect products helps us understand how engineering work is really accomplished."

      "text": "Rogers' chapter provides a historical account of the attempts and problems involved in trying to involve social scientists in the design of technology, beginning in the 1950s with the sociotechnical systems approach. Early attempts to save workers from deskilling and dehumanization did not really approach questions of design or technology, she argues, but primarily rearranged working groups. Somewhat later, when attempts were made to support or inform actual design in the human-computer interaction area, other sorts of problems arose. Often, psychologists and linguists were not focused on particularly design-relevant topics. At times, they took a condescending approach to designers themselves, prescribing at some distance and assuming lack of knowledge of users (or psychology, sociology, anthropology, or politics) on the part of designers and engineers. At the same time, pulling recommendations out of the context of a densely detailed study might simplify some of the social science precepts of the researchers trying to cooperate."

      "text": "What to do? Rogers notes that ethnomethodologists have metaphorically waded into the design room, and produced detailed empirical studies of work such as those of Sharrock and Button. Their efforts improve the situation in that they can provide good, domain-specific information for the general design team. However, she suggests, perhaps they do not go far enough. Social scientists need to work alongside designers, with all the day-to-day articulation work that implies. They can be translators and in-house consultants, as well as bring in interesting theoretical material from social science, such as activity theory (Nardi, 1996) or theories about a specific domain. She warns that such exercises are not easily formalizable, and may become somewhat \"schizophrenic\" in publication for more specialized audiences. Nevertheless, the participative approach walks away from the reified divides of earlier years, and moves toward a fuller partnership."

People can be said to \"read\" information systems and computers in the ways that readers and viewers wrestle the meanings of texts. Using a semiotic approach, he describes how the text moves away from the writer (not totally without structure or constraint, but unpredictably). Texts may generate meanings not anticipated by the writer; similarly, information systems are a generative source of new tricks and workarounds (Gasser, 1986). The interactive nature of the computer, of course, makes \"computer systems fall somewhere between the characteristics of interpreting text\" and actual discourse. In some ways, the desktop of computer can be seen as a person in such a discourse frame, although Yoneyama cautions against too simple an interpretation."

They are unique in that they have a kind of transience not found in other kinds of texts, and they are interactive. Using the tools of semiotics and hermeneutics, these features of computer systems may be read as a kind of communication, rather than as a blackbox or stable text. In this reading, the user is an active coconstructor of the system, but, as all the authors in this section note, he or she is tailoring and designing against a world of both constraints and [[possibilities]]. Sometimes parts of a system must be closed or opaque. Part of the art of design beyond the great divide is understanding where the hermeneutic distance is between design and use."

As well, the multiplicity and temporal character of knowledge mean that all representations, in Goguen's words, \"leak.\" As with Sharrock and Button, Goguen turns to ethnomethodology for detailed studies of workplaces to, following the liquid metaphor, at least make the liquids more viscous. He discusses the use of discourse analysis and narrative. In all of these moves, the value-laden quality of the information is central."

        "text": "Yoneyama discusses the interpretive flexibility of computers. People can be said to \"read\" information systems and computers in the ways that readers and viewers wrestle the meanings of texts. Using a semiotic approach, he describes how the text moves away from the writer (not totally without structure or constraint, but unpredictably). Texts may generate meanings not anticipated by the writer; similarly, information systems are a generative source of new tricks and workarounds (Gasser, 1986). The interactive nature of the computer, of course, makes \"computer systems fall somewhere between the characteristics of interpreting text\" and actual discourse. In some ways, the desktop of computer can be seen as a person in such a discourse frame, although Yoneyama cautions against too simple an interpretation."

They are unique in that they have a kind of transience not found in other kinds of texts, and they are interactive. Using the tools of semiotics and hermeneutics, these features of computer systems may be read as a kind of communication, rather than as a blackbox or stable text. In this reading, the user is an active coconstructor of the system, but, as all the authors in this section note, he or she is tailoring and designing against a world of both constraints and possibilities. Sometimes parts of a system must be closed or opaque. Part of the art of design beyond the great divide is understanding where the hermeneutic distance is between design and use."
