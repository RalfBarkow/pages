Assuming that we assume the continued existance of our planet as given in the long term, planetary or global sustainability essentially means the sustainability of the human species. From this we infer that sustainability of the human species means, first and foremost, that we are able to maintain the minimum concitions for human life. This implies a certain minimum condition of land, water, food, and shelter. At a global level, it is possible to calculate how much ecological resources would be necessary to keeping population growth at at least the level of not declining in numbers."

And it creates the need and the opportunity to get rid of things that groups have in excess, and that they can trade for other things they want. Inequality of resources and conditions may be substituted by other inequalities, and inequalities are an essential characteristic of human and social life."

This begs the question of how to create legitimate ways to address these issues. Politics is the science and practice of the legimate distribution of value."
