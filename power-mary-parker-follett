However, Follett indicates that power is usually seen as “power-over” another person or group, which is coercive. In her model of integration using the law of the situation in making the social organization a functional unity, power is jointly developed, coactive, and is termed “power-with” reflecting the participative process. For Follett power cannot be delegated, as genuine power is capacity, based upon the ability of individuals to grow capacity for themselves and focusing again on the development of the individual (Metcalf & Urwick, 1940). For Follett, the creative experience was the key to individual growth and [[Constructive Conflict]] was at the heart of interpersonal relations."
