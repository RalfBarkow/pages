Numerous experiences indicate that very complex systems which are autonomous to a high degree, if one may qualify the word, increase in independence and in specific dependence at the same time. In modern society, an economic system, a legal system, or a political system is highly independent, but equally dependent on the environment. If the economy does not flourish, it becomes politically difficult, and if politics is not able to provide certain assurances, for example about law, or if politics intervenes too much, this becomes a problem in the economy. We have to distinguish, this leads back to the thesis of operational closure, between causal dependence/independence on the one hand and self-generated operations on the other."

We have, especially in European culture, a strong notion of converting everything into causality and then, for example, also understanding terms like \"an operation produces an operation\" or \"production\" always causally.

We keep slipping into the idea that the thesis of operational closure is a particular thesis about the internal causality of systems. In a sense, it is. One can convert it to causality.
