When a rejection is communicated, the problem for the social system is that it must react to the resulting situation of insecurity; the pre-programed options (the offer of communication and its rejection) mutually exclude one another. One observes that they cannot exist simultaneously, and no reality corresponds to them. This impossibility of co-existence concerns the structures of →[[expectations]] of the social system, since these structures dissolve as a result of their contradictory characteristic. The connectivity of communication can only be secured by the contradiction itself, which provides the foundations for a particular social system: the conflict system. Conflict arises from the contradiction and is founded on the possibilities that it contains; namely, negation. Here, →[[double contingency]] takes on the form of a double negation: “I won’t do what you want, if you don’t do what I want.” Communication can continue because it reacts to the contradiction as a contradiction.\n"

The observer (which can be the social system within which the contradiction arose) lacks structural points of reference to guide the observation, and the situation thus appears to the observer to be undecidable. But even if the observation is blocked, operations within the system that generated the contradiction can still continue to be produced [→[[Operation/Observation]]]. Despite the insecurity of the expectation, the system can react operatively: it can react without cognition of the contradictory factor. The system does not react to the rejection (to the *no* generated by the contradiction) to maintain the endangered structures. Instead, it reacts to the inadequateness of these structures for the environment. It is therefore not a “conservative” reaction that resolves the source of disturbance for the benefit of the status quo; rather, the rejection that leads to the contradiction—and in some cases to the conflict—forces the system to suspend the connectivity of the structures and to rely on the new situation. The system protects only its own autopoiesis and not the given structures. In their place, the contradiction guides communication.\n\n"

        "text": "In social systems, contradictions provide a moment of self-reference of communication and require particular operations. When a rejection is com- municated, the problem for the social system is that it must react to the result- ing situation of insecurity; the pre-programed options (the offer of commu- nication and its rejection) mutually exclude one another. One observes that they cannot exist simultaneously, and no reality corresponds to them. This impossibility of co-existence concerns the structures of →expectations of the social system, since these structures dissolve as a result of their contradic- tory characteristic. The connectivity of communication can only be secured by the contradiction itself, which provides the foundations for a particular social system: the conflict system. Conflict arises from the contradiction and is founded on the possibilities that it contains; namely, negation. Here, →dou- ble contingency takes on the form of a double negation: “I won’t do what you want, if you don’t do what I want.” Communication can continue because it reacts to the contradiction as a contradiction.\nContradictions represent problems of undecidability for those observing the communication. The observer (which can be the social system within which the contradiction arose) lacks structural points of reference to guide the observation, and the situation thus appears to the observer to be unde- cidable. But even if the observation is blocked, operations within the system that generated the contradiction can still continue to be produced [→Op- eration/Observation]. Despite the insecurity of the expectation, the system can react operatively: it can react without cognition of the contradictory factor. The system does not react to the rejection (to the no generated by the contradiction) to maintain the endangered structures. Instead, it reacts to the inadequateness of these structures for the environment. It is therefore not a “conservative” reaction that resolves the source of disturbance for the benefit of the status quo; rather, the rejection that leads to the contradic- tion—and in some cases to the conflict—forces the system to suspend the connectivity of the structures and to rely on the new situation. The system protects only its own autopoiesis and not the given structures. In their place, the contradiction guides communication.\n\n"
