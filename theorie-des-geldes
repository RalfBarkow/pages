      "text": "Paul's theory succeeds in developing a coherent chain of argumentation in monetary theory, which combines functionalist figures of thought from the micro-level of social interactions to the macro-level of social differentiation. It takes a position on the development and functioning of money as well as on contemporary monetary policy. The first chapter rejects as sociologically inadequate the economic theory of money as a means of exchange, which saw money purely as a tool of market exchange. The implicit thesis of the emergence of money as a convention of exchange is widely considered to have been refuted, but it remains a figure of thought that shapes discourse. In the second chapter, Paul turns to alternative \"primal scenes of money\" (p. 49). The direct exchange of goods, he explains with reference to anthropological studies, is at best a marginal form of interaction in human history. In pre-monetary communities, profane goods for the satisfaction of everyday needs were borrowed or given as gifts, not exchanged. The origin of money, according to Paul, is therefore not to be found in exchange, but in practices of forgiving debts: in religious sacrificial thanksgiving, in diplomatic ceremonies of retribution for violence and offenses, and in tax debts to political authorities. Money, then, was not originally a tool of trade but an institution of redemption (p. 61)."

      "text": "The third chapter presents the modern financial system as a logical further development of monetary functions. According to Paul, money first of all enables a \"special way of dealing with [[Time]]\" (p. 11). The availability of this institution frees the individual, as [[Georg Simmel]] already noted, from the necessity of meeting his or her reproductive needs on his or her own, thus implying a kind of \"promise of freedom\" (p. 104), but thereby creates new dependencies. It is true that in a money economy it is no longer absolutely necessary to produce food in order to become full, but for this one must remain solvent. The vague risk of need satisfaction has been replaced by the concrete risk of liquidity. Modern financial systems now offer a variety of ways to satisfy the need for solvency (debt) and at the same time maintain it (saving) and to make the risks of losing liquidity transferable and tradable. This handling of monetary freedoms creates a new dimension of financial risks and thus potentials of specifically financial crises. Sociology of finance is thus characterized as an extended continuation of basic questions of the sociology of money."

      "text": "The fourth chapter problematizes the current production conditions of book money and discusses alternatives. Book money is created as bank deposits through interest-bearing loans, either as reserves (book money of the central bank) or as scriptural money (book money of the commercial banks). Paul contradicts the regulatory rumor that the book money production of central banks sharply limits the money creation of private commercial banks \"because credit-based book money creation precedes the deposit of reserves\" (p. 146). This results in high degrees of autonomy of private commercial banks in money creation. These privileges and their socio-economic consequences have given impetus to critiques and alternative payment systems and models since the 2008 financial crisis. Paul, however, cannot find much to like about hyper-liberal market solutions such as radical competition in means of payment or decentralized digital cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin) (pp. 148-161) or nationalization programs of money, such as the full money reform (pp. 162-175). Instead, he focuses his own critique on a powerful monetary policy fiction that proclaims price stability as the common good and independent central banks as ideal agents of that common good. Accordingly, central banks are supposed to ensure a moderate increase in the value relations between money and goods, defined as stability, because this would neutralize the effects of money and thus make it work in the best interests of all economic agents. According to this fiction, these institutions could only succeed in doing so through the greatest possible autonomy from parliamentary decision-making processes and electoral cycles. The problem: Monetary policy is in reality, according to Paul, \"by no means neutral, but inevitably favors individual social groups or classes\" (p. 187)."
