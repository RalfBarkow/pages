It must be able to distinguish die number of states (or the variety) it is to transmit and it must be able to do so in the time allotted. In a discrete channel such as a telegraph wire, die capacity is spoken of in terms of the \"logarithm of the numbers of symbols of certain time duration... die number of such symbols handled.. the amount of information transmitted per second, using bits per second as a unit.\" The needed amount of channel capacity can be figured accurately for Morse code or teletype.\n\nIt is more difficult to figure the needed channel capacity for an information system for management but it must be able at a minimum to handle the variety in the capacities of die reporting units.
