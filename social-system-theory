The society that we observe is no longer that of Marx, of Weber, of Durkheim. Still less is it that of the Enlightenment or the French Revolution. More than ever before, the past has lost its authority—even in terms of the value criteria that were once fundamental to the pursuit of rationality. And more than ever before, perhaps for exactly this reason, it has become uncertain what kind of future awaits us. Matters are little changed by the application of specific scientific methods, of explanation and prognosis. However, it should be a least possible to appropriately describe what we face. \n–– [[\nNiklas Luhmann]], Foreword to the Italian Edition of [[Unlocking Luhmann]]"

The society that we observe is no longer that of Marx, of Weber, of Durkheim. Still less is it that of the Enlightenment or the French Revolution. More than ever before, the past has lost its authority—even in terms of the value criteria that were once fundamental to the pursuit of ra- tionality. And more than ever before, perhaps for exactly this reason, it has become uncertain what kind of future awaits us. Matters are little changed by the application of specific scientific methods, of explanation and progno- sis. However, it should be a least possible to appropriately describe what we face."
