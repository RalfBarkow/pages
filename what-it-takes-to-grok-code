In this case, they should have propagated the exception further up by declaring it in the throws clause of the enclosing method.

In this case, they should have propagated the exception further up by declaring it in the throws clause of the enclosing method. The other possibility is that it is not from a third-party library in which case it is modifiable. Either way, I can't really see a reason why code should go into production looking like this. At the very least (and this is <i>not</i> in my view an option in production) there should be a comment in that empty catch to explain why there is no processing being done.",
