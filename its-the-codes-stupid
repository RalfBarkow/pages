In 1919, for example, the Scotsman Arthur Keith, an anthropologist and anatomist, described man as an engine system in which the bony and fleshy components were responsible for progress and movement and, if poorly maintained, for decay. The German Fritz Kahn copied the idea and in 1922 produced the still memorable machine man: \"Man as Industrial Palace\". In Kahn's work, the command center is made up of men in white coats; workers have to turn substances into sugar at the pipes by the liver. Fritz Kahn, an ardent Zionist in his younger years, transformed himself as a doctor into a racial physician who willingly published on \"The Hygiene of the Jews\". Alexei Gastev, a Communist poet, founded the \"Central Institute of Labor\" in 1920 and \"regarded machines as his 'iron friends' and called the 'crashing, whistling, grinding and screaming of the apparatus in the factories' the 'music of the future.'\" Gifted historian Philipp Blom describes these and other stories, including how Soviet workers were strapped to machines to internalize perfect motion through endless repetition. Gastev was a successful missionary of the Communist Machine Society, highly decorated and revered, until he was taken away by the Soviet secret police in 1938 and shot after a purge. His murderers continued unflinchingly with his soulless visions of social automatons. These were also revered by Western visitors to the Soviet killing machine and disseminated uncritically in Europe as well as in the United States. The Bauhaus school under Walter Gropius, for example, created \"utopias of concrete\" (Philipp Blom): here, too, the ideal was to simplify human life \"by fixing modernity on function rather than on relationship and movement\" (laStaempfli IFG 2007). To this day, many builders pursue hierarchical visions that demand optimization from people. In 1925, for example, Le Corbusier proposed to raze the most beautiful city in the world, Paris, to the ground: Instead of the city center, there would henceforth only be residential towers and highways."
