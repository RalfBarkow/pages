Then one no longer sees the hominid with its toothache and the stone in its materiality, but the stone beating. Only then one sees the technique. And other questions arise. For example: When hitting a hominid comes out on the one hand and on the other hand a hewn stone, but what was before? By no means a non-hewing hominid, because a hominid is after all a cattle that hews stones, and by no means an unhewn stone, because a stone is after all an object for hominids."

The question is to be answered in the negative, because only in the stone it turned out what \"tooth\" is. In the opposite part the hominid comes only on the fact that he has teeth, after he has produced the stone, and these teeth are possible pointed stones, which concretize themselves only in the stone-beating. And if the hominid says afterwards of cave tigers that they have teeth, then he means peculiar pointed stones.

The point is to propose a new concept of freedom (new political categories). In order to understand that work makes one unfree, one must know what is meant by \"freedom\". The ancients seem to have known it: Contemplation is freedom, such as theory and Sabbath (which in Christianity was summarized in the term \"prayer\"). This can no longer be true. We can no longer dismiss the work as a negation of contemplation (as a-scholie, as neg-otium), i.e., suggest, for example, academies, Sabbath consecrations, or monasteries as an alternative to K Z 's. We have to look for alternatives to K Z 's in technology, that is, to try to peel the concept of freedom out of technology. The K Z is itself a consequence of the technique. So we must try to analyze technology for the possibilities for unfreedom and freedom hidden in it: to examine technology, turned inside out like a glove, for possible developments of work and freedom.

If a hologram is to bend, it must reach into another dimension than the usual third. Since the outstretched, not yet fully human hand can reach for itself, for that not yet fully human hand which is searching for the fully human, it must be able to turn around itself, to bend comparable to a Möbius strip. If we want to remain in the picture, then we must bend ourselves (and the picture in which we are) à la Möbius."

Then one finds out that with the word \"Überlegung\" nothing else is meant. \"Reflecting\", radically carried out, can mean nothing else than folding the course of thoughts into a Möbius strip. And the Möbius dizziness is experienced by everyone who tries to think about something (whatever) radically. Maybe this is connected with the fact that we think with two hands, back and forth between the right and the left one. But the two hands can only be brought to coincide with each other in the fourth dimension, by a möbius-like rotation. Much easily this is the explanation for the fact that one has the impression to turn over gloves when doing philosophy. Not the notorious mirror, but the upturned glove is the tool of reflection.
