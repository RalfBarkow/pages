Suddenly, you do not know anymore what you previously thought you knew. As I see it, that is why a bigger model \"destroys knowledge\". Of course, you can get the very same result while coding the first model, then trying to code into some more detail. I always thought that it is better to change the model than the code.

It's true that you can't figure out all the details beforehand because if you do, you'd actually be coding in English, which is a mess. The analysis should be limited to a broad scope or be done as an overall picture + the game strategy. You define what the puzzle probably looks like, you identify you gray areas, your puzzle's areas in green (grass?) and then you start coding (trying the actually fit the pieces, maybe first separating by colors and other signs (strategy), then trying to complete some small areas). The puzzle analogy is only two dimensional, but I think it's useful. If you have a puzzle with 200 pieces, things may be easy and no analysis required. You start trying to fit things into place, and refactor (done areas) until you have the puzzle solved. But if it's a 3D puzzle of 5000 pieces, and some surfaces have different rules for fitting, then you need some vision and some strategy. You don't care about implementation details nor about the little details, and certainly the working \"papers\" shouldn't be longer than 10 pages. If they are, then I'd say time was wasted. -- [[Fede Rico]]",

Perhaps he meant <i>choose a level of detail for your model that doesn't make it so thick with detail that you can't see the forest for the trees.</i> Sometimes projects with many pieces have specific rules for how those pieces interact that need to be understood. You could look at it like a top-down diagram: On level one, you can see only the entirety of the 3D puzzle as a whole (a huge penguin, for example), with no distinctions between parts. After breaking it down, on level two you notice that there is a distinction between the fins and the beak and the rest of the body. The next distinction you might make happens within those previous distinctions: we distinguish between colors and textures. The making of distinctions can continue infinitely (in real reality... because of the granularity of computers, perhaps there is a limit when making distinctions in software), the art consists in knowing when to stop. It's probably similar to the art of deciding when a bit of code should become its own function. -- [[Scott Williams]]",

An analyst who has never been a developer, or hasn't been a developer on this platform, may blithely assume that something is easy, when it is hard or impossible, or that something is hard and requires much modeling detail, when it is actually quite easy.  In the latter case, you wasted time producing unneeded details.  In the former case, you may have wasted the whole model by designing something that can't be built.  My experience is that the precise difference between a great developer and a decent developer is the ability to assess what is easy and what is not.  For less skilled developer, it's more effective to get right to the hard part, and that can only happen by trying to write the code and seeing it fail.

The analysis should be limited to a broad scope or be done as an overall picture + the game strategy. You define what the puzzle probably looks like, you identify you gray areas, your puzzle's areas in green (grass?) and then you start coding (trying the actually fit the pieces, maybe first separating by colors and other signs (strategy), then trying to complete some small areas). The puzzle analogy is only two dimensional, but I think it's useful. If you have a puzzle with 200 pieces, things may be easy and no analysis required. You start trying to fit things into place, and refactor (done areas) until you have the puzzle solved. But if it's a 3D puzzle of 5000 pieces, and some surfaces have different rules for fitting, then you need some vision and some strategy. You don't care about implementation details nor about the little details, and certainly the working \"papers\" shouldn't be longer than 10 pages.

You could look at it like a top-down diagram: On level one, you can see only the entirety of the 3D puzzle as a whole (a huge penguin, for example), with no distinctions between parts. After breaking it down, on level two you notice that there is a distinction between the fins and the beak and the rest of the body. The next distinction you might make happens within those previous distinctions: we distinguish between colors and textures. The making of distinctions can continue infinitely (in real reality... because of the granularity of computers, perhaps there is a limit when making distinctions in software), the art consists in knowing when to stop. It's probably similar to the art of deciding when a bit of code should become its own function. -- [[Scott Williams]]",

My experience is that the precise difference between a great developer and a decent developer is the ability to assess what is easy and what is not.
