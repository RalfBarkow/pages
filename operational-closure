One of these questions concerns Luhmann's proposal to temporalize the notion of the component of autopoietic systems. It is *[[event]]s* that self-referentially differentiate and reproduce autopoietic systems. Events appear and disappear. They have a punctually stable but fleeting existence. In this form they reproduce the [[problem]] they solve. They are a connecting event in search of connecting events. In sociology, this is immediately obvious. Both action and communication can only be thought in this temporalized sense. Any structure beyond this is an expectation that certain events will or will not occur. This idea is compatible with [[Heinz von Foerster]]'s concept of [[operational closure]]: operationally closed systems are subject to the condition – their only condition – that every end is also a beginning. This implies a temporal understanding of operation, even though von Foerster does not make this explicit. Possibly this is easier to think of in physics than in biology. Electronic impulses have per se an ephemeral identity. How would this idea work in the description of neuronal systems, immune systems, organisms? "
