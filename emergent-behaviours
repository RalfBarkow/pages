It must reduce complexity, as the formula is then called. It must try to find elegant solutions to much more difficult problems. It must simplify.

        "text": "Ralf has here reminded me of the aspirations and implementation of algorithmic diagrams, especially the speculation that automatically refreshed diagrams might guide a work in progress. Now we know, yes, they deliver guidance, within a region, but possibly not over the scope of a large effort, such as \nmike_hales\n describes.\n\nRalf adds to this the notion of gradually reducing complexity. I'm unsure if the diagrams themselves are to be reduced, or if the presence of the diagrams would guide reduction in the complexity of what they represent. Let's explore both.\n\nI mention implementation because an exotic feature of algorithmic drawing was that it could read enough pages fast enough to be useful. It could do this on its own by overlapping the I/O associated with its graph traversal. If we want to look further some \"precomputing\" will be necessary. Classically databases build and maintain \"indexes\". Our decentralized variation is called Site Survey.
