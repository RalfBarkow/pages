There's no such thing as compile-time binding.  In other words, [[Objective Cee]] is like an interpreted language in terms of flexibility and power (string-to-method-invocation is a no brainer) while having the speed of a fully compiled language (rather than being compiled only to byte code).  (Yes, other O-O languages have some the data portion of a runtime: RTTI ([[Run Time Type Information]]) for C++, and reflection accesses this information in Java, but no other compiled, C-based language uses the runtime for all method dispatch.)",

In addition to being a useful way of grouping class functionality so that multiple developers could conveniently work on different parts of a class, it allows for the addition of new functionality at any point in the class hierarchy by object consumers (rather than just producers). Say you need every instance of any subclass of the [[Super Gizmo Widget]] class that you purchased/found in some code library to be able to perform a \"twirlAboutAxis:\" method.  Well, just add such a method into a category on the [[Super Gizmo Widget]] class and voila!  In other words its the exact opposite of the notion of a \"finalize\"d class.  The limitation is that since instance VARIABLES, unlike instance and class METHODS affect the amount of space that's allocated for an instance, you can't add variables in a category -- or new instances would become incompatible with existing compiled ones.
