It is basically a group of VSM savvy folks who are intent on doing something with the VSM before it is too late. The group began with Marc Pierson, Peter Tuddenham, Allenna Leonard, Angela Espinosa, Jon Walker, Jan Borda, William Smith, Kerry Turner, Noah Williams and Louise Lowings. Most active at this juncture (Sept. 2020) are Marc, Allenna, Jon and Angela. We have exploratory work going on in Columbia and in Washington State. Seven of us met in Bogota in February 2020 to self-organize. This Brain site documents those meetings: [https://bra.in/7vPgd9 Brain]"
