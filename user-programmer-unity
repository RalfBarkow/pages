The development of fast and efficient programming languages such as Lisp and Smalltalk in the past had a significant impact on the field of computer science, particularly in the area of programming languages and development. The development of JavaScript in the 2010-2015 era enabled faster and more sophisticated web applications to be built, further expanding the possibilities of what could be done in a web browser.\n\nHowever, despite these technological advancements, the fundamental separation between programmers and users remained. Programmers still needed to write code in order to create software applications, and end-users still needed to interact with these applications in ways that were often constrained by the limitations of the technology.\n\nThe development of new technologies such as natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence have the potential to bridge the gap between programmers and end-users by enabling more natural and intuitive interactions with software. However, there is still much work to be done in this area, and it remains to be seen how these technologies will ultimately impact the field of computer science and software development."

Virtual Reality Interface for Assist in Programming of Tasks of a Robotic Manipulator.

Cham: Springer International Publishing. 2021. p. 328–335. Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering. ISBN 978-3-030-53021-1. DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-53021-1_33. The creation of interfaces that contribute to the interaction between a programmer and an industrial robot are based on implementing adequate procedures that facilitate people without knowledge of robotics and programming of robotic manipulators to generate tasks or activities that the robotic arm executes. In this article, it describes the creation of a programming interface using virtual reality, as an immersion tool in the work environment of the yaskawa motoman HP20D robot. This virtual environment was developed from 3D models, later exported to the Unity 3D video game engine, in this interface the functions are programmed that allow the user to interact with the robot according to the movements and trajectories performed by the user in the work environment. A MYO Armband sensor is used to operate the position and orientation of the end effector of the robot within the environment and the Oculus Riff DK2 virtual reality glasses are used to visualize the entire space, with a first-person perspective. As a result, a computational tool is obtained that allows generating trajectories, recording them, simulating them and generating the script or programming code to be implement in the robotic manipulator controller.\n"
