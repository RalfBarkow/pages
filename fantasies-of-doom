      "text": "In the last six years, from which the contributions of the volume \"*Ein Lichtlein für die Toten. Flüchtlingsabwehr, Klimaschutz und Corona*\" originate, the society of capital drifted, as it seems, from one crisis into the next. The \"refugee crisis\" was already considered the \"crisis of the century,\" closely followed by the \"climate crisis,\" which promised imminent doom if no \"radical rethinking\" took place. Since the beginning of 2020, a virus has been threatening not only the society of capital, but also the life and limb of individuals. As tempting as it may be to relate all these crises to each other in an 'ideology-critical' way, possibly even to subsume them under a single term, it would be wrong to subsume the ideological reactions to these crises all too quickly under an authoritarian, postmodern or neoliberal constitution of the subject, as if the things themselves (such as the war in Syria, the change in the climate or a deadly virus) did not exist at all or could simply be abstracted from the respective suffering. Yet the crises of recent years do have something in common. Just as the society of capital, under the economic compulsion to permanently revolutionize itself, only sustains itself through constant crises, the subjects in every situation perceived as a crisis oscillate antinomically between the cynical view of seeing the 'crisis as an opportunity' and [[Fantasies of Doom]], which mostly aim at sadistic pleasure in renunciation, isolation and destruction."
