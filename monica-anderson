On the other hand, Tao Weidong et al[15] suggested a learning system based on intuition through Artificial Intuition Networks as a mechanism of cooperative learning which will provide to the user a game-like experience, making situations more obvious and easier to learn. Finally, Jitesh Dundas et al[14] proposed an algorithm of artificial intelligence based on intuition-like mechanism which includes grossly the following stages: 1) obtaining initial conditions, 2) obtaining an equation from recollected pieces of human experiences, 3) obtaining of weight values of importance, 4) recognition of waste information, 5) application of adjustment factors to calculate the final answer, and 6) displaying the answer to the user."

In this work, we performed an analysis about analogies between human and artificial intuition using INPUTS, PROCESSING, and OUTPUTS.

Existing methods almost universally use Models of Language (Dictionaries, Grammars, Word Nets, Taxonomies, and Ontologies). The two simplest and most pervasive Models claim that Languages have Words and that those Words have Meanings. While acknowledging that good alternatives do not yet exist, this talk attempts to make plausible that these two \"obvious\" but fatally incorrect Models result, automatically, in a cascading series of forced engineering decisions that each discard a fraction of the available semantics until we end up with brittle systems that fail in catastrophic and memorable ways. The proposed alternative to word-centric Model Based methods of language analysis is Understanding Machines - capable of learning languages the way humans learn languages in babyhood - using new classes of algorithms based on Model Free Methods."
