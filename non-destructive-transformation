I suspect that this applies to built environment, computer programming, neighborhood relationships, and so much more. There must be enough freedom and choice that each part can move in accord with its self and its adjacencies. It cannot be done to something. It cannot be centrally controlled except by sharing the simple rules, patterns, and principles that still must be used in unique situations."

Ostrom's group refer to [[Polycentricity]] which points toward this multisystem multi level kind of mixing and matching that is culturally unfamiliar to Westerners so used to strict tree hierarchies--restrictive categories. One can and generally is part (often playing different roles) of several entities. This does not get discussed very much. In a networked world, as opposed to a strict hierarchy, we all must better understood these possibilities and realities. People make these shifts easily, but we are less fluid in the organizational domain. Christopher Alexander's paper, [[A City is Not a Tree]], lays out these distinctions well."
