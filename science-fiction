It encompasses many sub-genres such as [[Hard Science Fiction]], where the implications of possible scientific advance are explored, [[Space Opera]], which usually includes scantily clad alien babes and [[Bug Eyed Monsters]], and Utopian or Dystopian visions of the future. Depending on whom you ask, the line between [[Science Fiction]] and fantasy tends to blur, and [[Alternate History]], which explores the result of some change in the past, doesn't fit comfortably under either term, but is often discussed with both.

For instance, consider a lot of work by [[Roger Zelazny]], such as Creatures of Light and Darkness, or Changeling. Or, for that matter, where do Piers Anthony's 'Blue Adept' novels fit in? There's science... but there's fantasy. As such, I think '[[Science Fantasy]]' is sort of a warning label to explain that there's <i>real</i> magic or something similar going on, not just more \"easily explained\" processes like psionics. Generally speaking, when supernatural elements become involved that aren't explainable (and are more than just philosophical) in the context of the book, that's where fantasy leaks in. Just my two cents. :)",

Take, for example, a story about a man with a genetic condition that means he travels in time unaided: Poul Anderson's novel <i>There Will Be Time</i> (shelved under SF) or Audrey Niffenegger's <i>The Time Traveller's Wife</i> (shelved under General Fiction) - the latter meets all the criteria for fairly hard SF - it is the postulation of a single new technology/discovery (the genetic condition that allows him to travel through time) and the exploration of the logical consequences of it - but it's marketed, not to SF fandom, but to the generic reading public...",
