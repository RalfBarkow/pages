Group writing is a social activity, and students who participated in group writing experiments felt it was a good learning exercise. The two parts of collaborative writing that researchers indicated were most influential were [[Peer review]] and brainstorming.  Students that chose to do group and independent writing in a gave feedback that group writers came away feeling like they had thought of something with their partners that they wouldn’t have on their own - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_writing#Benefits_of_Collaborative_Writing wikipedia]"

      "text": "Peer reviewing made readers feel more connected to the writing, and authors were able to get specific feedback from their audience. Teachers who observed collaborative groups said that members were more receptive and willing to change for constructive criticism. Peer reviewing and brainstorming requires all parties to use critical thinking skills. Critical thinking skills in collaborative writing could be used in deciding on ideas, assigning what each person’s job is, and catering your writing to your audience."

      "text": "Researchers who did grammatical tests on group writing versus independent writing in students found that even though the amount group authors wrote was less, they used more grammatically complex sentences and answered the prompt accurately. Independent writers tended to use extra information and repeat words. Although collaborative writing can take more time to write the same amount as an independent writer, group plans and simple task work can help time strains."

Respondents in the professional world surveyed that they felt collaborative writing improved their writing because of their collaborator's knowledge, and they were able to spend more time on article quality together."
