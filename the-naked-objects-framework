Giving the user the ability to interact directly with the objects and enforcing a 1:1 relationship between what the user sees on the screen and the objects used to represent them allows the users to become problem solvers rather than process followers.  This pattern increases flexibility and empowers the users to find creative ways to solve problems.",

Interestingly, however, the original CUA documentation states clearly that the strongly object-oriented user interface on CUA is *not* a reflection of the underlying structure of the application.  The big breakthrough in [[Naked Objects]] was not the UI (had we been more familiar with the original CUA work at the time we might have copied it wholesale) it was realising that this could be a simple reflection of the underlying code structure.",
