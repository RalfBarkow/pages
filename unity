Round-brackets provide a tally via [[Accumulation]], which explicitly forbids deleting replicated units. In contrast, [ ] dominates rather than accumulates. We can express this as an iconic equation, one that reduces apparent multiplicity to unity. The Unification axiom defines the behavior of square-brackets."
