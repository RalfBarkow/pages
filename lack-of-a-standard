It was easy enough to “file out” basic Smalltalk language code that used the common kernel classes and move it to another Smalltalk product.

The problem was that all the platform services that built upon the core language and kernel classes—the things that make a platform a platform—were different. By 1995, there were at three major and several niche Smalltalk platforms competing in the client application platform space.
