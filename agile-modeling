The goal of agile modeling is to build a coarse model of a software system in the morning, analyze it in the afternoon, and refine it the next day. The repeated refinement eventually leads to a complete model built through a series of more and more fine-grained models. The methods of agile modeling utilize specific properties of programming languages, their similarities and expert knowledge to achieve the goal of agile modeling."
