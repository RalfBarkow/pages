Luke also shared his work with a co-created democratic learning community, where young people and adults share responsibility and power, and decisions are made based on consent. However, he acknowledged the challenges this approach faces, such as resistance to new ideas about childhood and education, and issues related to funding and resources. Kerry Turner appreciated Luke's work, describing his school as \"amazing.\""

She shared that her school has adopted a values-based approach, reducing fear and judgment within the system, and uses an inquiry-based curriculum that encourages challenging beliefs and perceptions. Tina highlighted the need for honesty about not knowing something and promoting curiosity and learning. She also mentioned the school's approach to fostering a sense of belonging and uncovering each child's genius, using the Genius Ball symbol and weekly assemblies to share passions. She also discussed the annual \"All of Us\" project which deviates from the national curriculum to focus on fostering a sense of belonging. Kerry and Tina discussed the importance of individual conversations and getting to know children, and the potential negative consequences of measuring information. Later, Louise shared her thoughts on the importance of continuous learning and the need to remember that all agents in the school system, including ideas, are in a state of flux. She emphasized the importance of fostering creativity, thinking differently, and building communities. The meeting also touched on the challenges of the education system, such as the necessity of testing all children at the same time and the toxic accountability in the UK's education system."

He underscored the crucial role of committed school principals in driving success despite limited resources. Marc Pierson expressed concerns about training children for a destructive global economic system.

        "text": "Quick recap\nThe meeting discussed the challenges and potential solutions in the education system, with a focus on community-oriented mental health support and alternative approaches to Ofsted inspections. Participants emphasized the need for a bottom-up approach to effect change and the importance of structural change over individual change. Other topics included the significance of experience-based learning, the balance between academic and other forms of learning, and the role of a watchful community in child safety. A technical issue caused the meeting to end prematurely, with the suggestion to reschedule on a different platform.\n\nSummary\nEducation, Book, and Community Views\n\nThe meeting began with introductory remarks and a brief discussion about the weather. The conversation then shifted to a book called \"Seeing the Forest for the Trees\" by Dennis, with Bea possibly having read it and it being suggested as a potential resource. Sue Cooper shared her views on education, emphasizing the importance of compassionate communities around children and teacher well-being. She also brought up challenges in the education system such as a rigid curriculum and fear of Ofsted inspections. Towards the end, Bea Herbert was invited to share her thoughts, though the transcript does not provide further details.\n\n\nCommunity-Oriented Mental Health Support\n\nBea Herbert discussed the organization's efforts to shift the focus of mental health support towards a more community-oriented approach, particularly in schools. The organization worked with young people to understand the root causes of their emotional and psychological distress, with many citing the education system as a significant source of stress. Bea also mentioned a four-year project focused on young people's perspectives of the education system's impact on their development and sense of self, leading to the development of an alternative Ofsted framework. The discussion was briefly interrupted by a technical glitch.\n\n\nEducation System Challenges Discussed\n\nThe discussion revolved around the challenges faced within the education system, particularly the absence of two head teachers, including Louise Lawings who retired early due to frustrations with Ofsted. The conversation emphasized the importance of understanding various perspectives to make informed decisions and the difficulties of influencing individuals in power such as Michael Gove, Dominic Cummings, and Amanda Spilman. Bea Herbert expressed concerns about the question of what education should look like, suggesting it should be answered by a community or self-governing body. Dennis Sherwood highlighted the challenge of convincing individuals in power to adopt different approaches and identified breaking into this network of power as the fundamental problem.\n\n\nConsultant Dennis Sherwood's Education and Systems Thinking Insights\n\nDennis Sherwood discussed his career as a consultant and his interest in education, particularly in the areas of thinking and creativity. He shared his experience with systems thinking and highlighted its potential drawbacks. Dennis also mentioned a study he conducted on Off Call, a system of grading in the UK education system. He revealed a significant issue where one in every four grades is incorrect, which he believes is due to a reinforcing loop in the system. Furthermore, he criticized the system's inability to correct these mistakes since 2016 and implicated Amanda Spielman, the former chair of Off Call, in this issue. He ended by sharing the backlash he faced for exposing these problems.\n\n\nEducation System Change Challenges\n\nDennis Sherwood highlighted the challenges of implementing change in the education system, stressing the need for a system tailored to users' needs. Kerry Turner shared her experience working on children's education, emphasizing the necessity of a bottom-up approach to effect change and the potential use of financial concerns as leverage. Marc Pierson introduced himself and discussed the increasing complexity future generations and current individuals will face, emphasizing the importance of creativity and public engagement. He also noted his availability for quick responses to any questions.\n\n\nGrassroots Approach to Community Problem-Solving\n\nMarc Pierson, Kerry Turner, Dennis Sherwood, and Bea Herbert discussed the importance of a grassroots approach to community problem-solving. Marc emphasized the need for local action and creativity, the use of martial arts as a metaphor for redirecting energy, and the importance of not blaming others. Kerry brought up the fear that often accompanies systemic change, suggesting that adults often benefit from and are therefore reluctant to change systems. Dennis and Bea added that those in power are often more concerned with maintaining their status than with accountability or efficiency. The group agreed that structural change is key, rather than trying to change individuals, and that community-level solutions are often more effective than involving higher authorities.\n\n\nExperience, Presence, and Creativity in Learning\n\nClaudius van Wyk and Marc Pierson engaged in a conversation about the significance of learning through experience and the role of presence and agility in this process. Claudius van Wyk stressed the importance of co-learning and responding to one's own experience of the world, rather than being lectured. He pointed out the astonishing ability of children to learn languages in an immersive environment. Marc agreed with Claudius van Wyk's points, but disagreed with the assessment that presence is difficult. He suggested making it easy for presence to occur, using the metaphor of a campfire for a business meeting. They also discussed the importance of creativity and the challenge of avoiding academic prejudice.\n\n\nBreathing, Movement, and Empowerment: A Child Project's Impact\n\nSue Cooper shared about a project aimed at teaching children in their final year of primary school how to breathe properly, using various movements like 'being a rainbow'. The project, which was run with the police force and the local council, had a significant impact on the children's self-responsibility, self-awareness, and confidence. The children, who had been heavily medicated and diagnosed, were able to reduce their medication and even attend their prom. They also became child champions, training other children and leading change within their school community. Kerry Turner and Marc Pierson also contributed to the discussion, with Kerry reflecting on her own childhood experiences and Marc sharing about similar issues in the US with organizations like the Boy Scouts.\n\n\nEducation Balance and Dialogue: Personal Experiences\n\nKerry, Sue, and Claudius van Wyk shared their personal experiences and perspectives on education. Kerry reflected on her experiences in the Pony Club, emphasizing the importance of effort and presentation. Sue highlighted the significance of extra-curricular education and the risk of over-emphasizing academia. Claudius van Wyk shared the lively debates at his family dinner table, which he considered a valuable learning experience. The conversation suggested a need to balance academic education with other forms of learning and emphasized the importance of dialogue and debate in education.\n\n\nChildhood Freedom and Safety: A Reflective Conversation\n\nKerry Turner reflected on her childhood experiences of riding horses without supervision, highlighting the lack of rules and freedom during her time. The conversation shifted to how kids used to make money during specific times of the year and shared experiences with chores. Marc Pierson emphasized the importance of a minimum set of rules for kids and the need for a more productive way to help children develop into good citizens. The group also discussed the dangers children face today compared to when they were younger and the impact of a watchful community on safety. Near the end of the meeting, a technical issue occurred, causing the group to suggest rescheduling on a different platform. The possibility of creating causal loop diagrams in future meetings was also discussed.\n\n\nNext steps\nExplore alternative platforms for the meetings, such as Google Meets or Zoom sessions with longer durations."

The conversation then shifted to a book called \"Seeing the Forest for the Trees\" by **Dennis Sherwood**, with **Bea Herbert** possibly having read it and it being suggested as a potential resource. **Sue Cooper** shared her views on education, emphasizing the importance of compassionate communities around children and teacher well-being. She also brought up challenges in the education system such as a rigid curriculum and fear of Ofsted inspections. Towards the end, Bea Herbert was invited to share her thoughts, though the transcript does not provide further details."

        "text": "**Bea Herbert** discussed the organization's efforts to shift the focus of mental health support towards a more community-oriented approach, particularly in schools. The organization worked with young people to understand the root causes of their emotional and psychological distress, with many citing the education system as a significant source of stress. Bea also mentioned a four-year project focused on young people's perspectives of the education system's impact on their development and sense of self, leading to the development of an alternative Ofsted framework. The discussion was briefly interrupted by a technical glitch.\n\n\n\n# Education System Challenges Discussed"

        "text": "The discussion revolved around the challenges faced within the education system, particularly the absence of two head teachers, including **Louise Lowings** who retired early due to frustrations with Ofsted. The conversation emphasized the importance of understanding various perspectives to make informed decisions and the difficulties of influencing individuals in power such as Michael Gove, Dominic Cummings, and Amanda Spilman. Bea Herbert expressed concerns about the question of what education should look like, suggesting it should be answered by a community or self-governing body. Dennis Sherwood highlighted the challenge of convincing individuals in power to adopt different approaches and identified breaking into this network of power as the fundamental problem.\n\n\n\n# Consultant Dennis Sherwood's Education and Systems Thinking Insights"

        "text": "Dennis Sherwood discussed his career as a consultant and his interest in education, particularly in the areas of thinking and creativity. He shared his experience with systems thinking and highlighted its potential drawbacks. Dennis also mentioned a study he conducted on Off Call, a system of grading in the UK education system. He revealed a significant issue where one in every four grades is incorrect, which he believes is due to a reinforcing loop in the system. Furthermore, he criticized the system's inability to correct these mistakes since 2016 and implicated Amanda Spielman, the former chair of Off Call, in this issue. He ended by sharing the backlash he faced for exposing these problems.\n\n\nEducation System Change Challenges\n\nDennis Sherwood highlighted the challenges of implementing change in the education system, stressing the need for a system tailored to users' needs. Kerry Turner shared her experience working on children's education, emphasizing the necessity of a bottom-up approach to effect change and the potential use of financial concerns as leverage. Marc Pierson introduced himself and discussed the increasing complexity future generations and current individuals will face, emphasizing the importance of creativity and public engagement. He also noted his availability for quick responses to any questions.\n\n\nGrassroots Approach to Community Problem-Solving\n\nMarc Pierson, Kerry Turner, Dennis Sherwood, and Bea Herbert discussed the importance of a grassroots approach to community problem-solving. Marc emphasized the need for local action and creativity, the use of martial arts as a metaphor for redirecting energy, and the importance of not blaming others. Kerry brought up the fear that often accompanies systemic change, suggesting that adults often benefit from and are therefore reluctant to change systems. Dennis and Bea added that those in power are often more concerned with maintaining their status than with accountability or efficiency. The group agreed that structural change is key, rather than trying to change individuals, and that community-level solutions are often more effective than involving higher authorities.\n\n\nExperience, Presence, and Creativity in Learning\n\nClaudius van Wyk and Marc Pierson engaged in a conversation about the significance of learning through experience and the role of presence and agility in this process. Claudius van Wyk stressed the importance of co-learning and responding to one's own experience of the world, rather than being lectured. He pointed out the astonishing ability of children to learn languages in an immersive environment. Marc agreed with Claudius van Wyk's points, but disagreed with the assessment that presence is difficult. He suggested making it easy for presence to occur, using the metaphor of a campfire for a business meeting. They also discussed the importance of creativity and the challenge of avoiding academic prejudice.\n\n\nBreathing, Movement, and Empowerment: A Child Project's Impact\n\nSue Cooper shared about a project aimed at teaching children in their final year of primary school how to breathe properly, using various movements like 'being a rainbow'. The project, which was run with the police force and the local council, had a significant impact on the children's self-responsibility, self-awareness, and confidence. The children, who had been heavily medicated and diagnosed, were able to reduce their medication and even attend their prom. They also became child champions, training other children and leading change within their school community. Kerry Turner and Marc Pierson also contributed to the discussion, with Kerry reflecting on her own childhood experiences and Marc sharing about similar issues in the US with organizations like the Boy Scouts.\n\n\nEducation Balance and Dialogue: Personal Experiences\n\nKerry, Sue, and Claudius van Wyk shared their personal experiences and perspectives on education. Kerry reflected on her experiences in the Pony Club, emphasizing the importance of effort and presentation. Sue highlighted the significance of extra-curricular education and the risk of over-emphasizing academia. Claudius van Wyk shared the lively debates at his family dinner table, which he considered a valuable learning experience. The conversation suggested a need to balance academic education with other forms of learning and emphasized the importance of dialogue and debate in education.\n\n\nChildhood Freedom and Safety: A Reflective Conversation\n\nKerry Turner reflected on her childhood experiences of riding horses without supervision, highlighting the lack of rules and freedom during her time. The conversation shifted to how kids used to make money during specific times of the year and shared experiences with chores. Marc Pierson emphasized the importance of a minimum set of rules for kids and the need for a more productive way to help children develop into good citizens. The group also discussed the dangers children face today compared to when they were younger and the impact of a watchful community on safety. Near the end of the meeting, a technical issue occurred, causing the group to suggest rescheduling on a different platform. The possibility of creating causal loop diagrams in future meetings was also discussed.\n\n\nNext steps\nExplore alternative platforms for the meetings, such as Google Meets or Zoom sessions with longer durations."

        "text": "Louise Lowings and Kerry Turner discussed the limitations of the current education system. Louise emphasized the importance of teaching children to express their ideas and defend them, even if it goes against the norm. She also noted that the current system does not adequately measure a child's effectiveness in the real world, which could lead to problems in the next phase of schooling. Kerry Turner suggested that a wider range of criteria such as the ability to function in groups, self-care, and good citizenship should be considered. They also discussed the role of political influence on the educational system, with Louise suggesting that it is not an educational decision."
