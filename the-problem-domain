This connection is made feasible by the Internet. Today it is possible for a global-scale network of many hundreds, if not thousands, of individual actors to share ideas asynchronously. We call this capability \"electronic discourse\". Members of a virtual community can interact via software interfaces to conduct on-going conversations on topics of interest. Email listservs, usnet and discussion boards were first generation e-discourse applications. These applications impose a minimum structure on the process of discourse. They basically organize topics and maintain a threading structure that allows for responses to be tracked. Beyond this, they do not provide any internal structure that might further facilitate the discourse process in reaching some kind of conclusion. And, even more importantly, they do not provide any management of the explosion of information that comes from the combined contributions of a huge number of participants. On a global scale, and with possibly millions of participants in a virtual community, it is vital that information be meaningfully consolidated, or pruned (if found unhelpful) in order to keep the discourse focused and productive.",

Even some of the email lists, usenet newsgroups and bulletin boards require a human moderator to filter, edit or summarize if they are to keep productive discourse going. Very little has been done in the area of computer-moderated, structured discourse support. This latter category goes beyond computer-mediated to actually include an intelligent moderator assistant. Such a facility may allow communities of interested parties to conduct true peer-to-peer collaborative, deliberative discourse without the time consuming and burdensome need for human moderators.",

Community members can grasp the core of the theme by reading a single comment that represents the nucleus rather than having to read, and recall all of the comments that seemed to agree.
