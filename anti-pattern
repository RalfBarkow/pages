Furthermore, there is a wealth of papers and seminars to assist an architect in documenting his own domain knowledge into design patterns so they can be more readily used by other professionals who enter into the industry. However, the dark side is that many of the people who are using design patterns fail to properly evaluate how applicable a particular design pattern or pattern language to their specific set of design concerns.

His presentation was based upon a detailed analysis of the object-oriented literature in the industry and was an attempt to define a common convergence of ideas about object-orientation. The presentation focused on recognizing harmful software constructs, which were reoccurring across several software projects. This is the complimentary antithesis of the GoF patterns, which emphasizes the use of proven good designs, and which can be applied in constructing new software.",
