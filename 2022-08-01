Both terms, correctly understood, pick up an essential aspect of logic. According to the classical definition, syncategoremata are terms that can be neither subject nor predicates in a sentence. Medieval logicians that defined logical constants this way considered, following Aristotle, that being either the entity named by the subject or the property expressed by the predicate were the only two possible elements of a proposition. Therefore, according to this view, syncategorematic terms didn’t contribute a component to the proposition at the same level as subject and predicate do"

The theory unifies the graphical, potential-outcome (Neyman-Rubin), decision analytical, and structural equation approaches to causation, and provides both a mathematical foundation and a friendly calculus for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper establishes a methodology for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) the answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effect of potential interventions, (2) queries about counterfactuals, and (3) queries about the direct (or indirect) effect of one event on another.\n"

Because every hint is necessarily based on a distinction and because every distinction forms the 'outer' form of every distinction by its different aspects, the idea of distinction is introduced as the form. This is followed by the only explicitly named definition of the book: \"Definition: [[Distinction]] is perfect continence\" (LoF: 1).\n\nThis is followed by an example of a distinction, from which can be derived four logically equivalent aspects that for Spencer Brown belong to the form of distinction: two distinguished, the boundary between them, and a context in which the distinction makes a difference in Spencer Brown's sense. Finally, two axioms or laws are presented that determine the ways in which the distinguished sides brought forth by the distinction can be referred to: axiom 1. law of calling and axiom 2. law of crossing. The two axioms determine which regularities are to be valid for the repeated use of the respective kind of indication and make possible by their difference to point to the\ndistinguished sides of the originated form.\n\n\n"

      "text": "The two presuppositions 'distinction' and 'hint' thus immediately reappear as something to be defined (Definiendum) and as something explicated by two different kinds of use. While the definition of distinction contains what the act of distinguishing analytically produces, as it were (the aspects of distinction), the idea of hint is explicated by laws of use. Accordingly, in the first chapter we explicitly find stage (1) and (2 b) of our scheme. Stages (3) and (4) do not appear until the second chapter: the words and terms used or employed by Spencer Brown to write the first chapter, which in the first chapter have an explicative or defining character with respect to the two presupposed ideas, are themselves explicitly introduced and defined in the second chapter."
