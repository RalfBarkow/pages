      "text": "In classical, rational-instrumental organizational theory, the concept of organization had both a broad and a narrow sense. On the one hand, organization was understood to mean systems that sought to achieve certain goals in a rational and efficient manner; and, on the other hand, the necessary endowment of competencies and communication channels to do so. Organization was thus not conceived as a natural system; it was not simply there, but had to be organized. The ambiguity of the use of the term organization to designate the system and the structure of the system seems to be related to the fact that business administration, as already mentioned, refers to the organizations of interest to it as \"enterprises\" and thus keeps the term organization free for describing the distribution of tasks among jobs. Accordingly, considerations on improving the organization started with this instrument of networking jobs. It was a matter of questions such as the size (number of jobs) required for certain tasks, the distribution of competencies in the form of superordination and subordination, and the unity and controllability of the system to be ensured in this way; further, in the development of this principle, around questions of centralization or decentralization, around the \"span of control\" of the superordinate agencies, which should not be exceeded for reasons of manageability of the system, around auxiliary functions (staff functions), around their extent and around their conflicts with the line responsibilities of the hierarchy; finally, in a further extension of the same starting point, around the question whether cooperation/collusion of the subordinates should be promoted by \"group formation\" or combated as \"clique formation\". With all modification, with all supplementation, the classical theory concentrated on the principle of hierarchy – understood not as an inclusion hierarchy of parts into the larger whole, but as a chain of command from top to bottom. The aim was to secure the unity of the system, which was to be capable of making decisions like an individual, at the top. If nothing else, this has led to an overestimation of the frequency with which hierarchical communication channels are actually used."

      "text": "The distinction between horizontal (division of labor) and vertical (hierarchical) differentiation could tempt one to regard the problems of job organization as problems of the division of labor and thus as problems of coordination and to leave their solution to the hierarchy (although the latter, for its part, must also be set up on the basis of the division of labor). Via the detour of a distinction between different types of decision premises, one arrives at a more complex representation. One then sees that classical organization theory had expected too much of hierarchy and, above all, also the solution of its own consequential problems. This was already seen with the distinction between formal and informal organization, but it was not sufficiently grasped as long as one saw only different instruments of management in it. In the meantime, not least thanks to a \"revaluation\" of the problems of personnel management and career planning, a more complex analysis has become unavoidable. For this, of course, it is not enough to commit oneself to a criticism or a weakening of the principle of hierarchical organization. The management tasks appear rather larger and at the same time more difficult, at any rate more problematic than before."

For all the \"principles,\" as in rhetoric, there were good and bad names, so one could choose the labels depending on what one wanted to achieve. But how could one know what one wanted?"
