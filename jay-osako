It will be possible to invoke any operation in this manner. Menus would be constructed from 'fixed hot' text ('fixed' in that it is bound in place; 'hot' in that it can be activated by a single Do click, without first selecting it), while icons would of course be simply visual shortcuts (both in the sense of a link and in the sense of a representation) to a designated script function.

Dynamically updated data would be referenceable using link daemons - functions that create new links as the datasets are updated. Since the data is minimally formatted, it should be possible to use it to source a variety of tools - for example, a given dataset might be quoted in a text document, used as a record field in an RBDMS, or used as data for constructing a pie chart. Since the documents are generated dynamically from the links, it is equally a 'part' of each, without losing it's own identity.

Unfortunately, this is also the point where my own ideas tend to lose their cohesion; I have trouble fixing a particular direction. One idea I have considered - but which I think may prove impractical - a 'floating first person' system in which the 'central' default window is only an 'anchor point' for one of several two-dimensional panels (and three dimensional boxes) hanging freely in a simulated space. The user could set swap commands to switch between them, or 'disconnect' and roam through the space itself using the mouse like in many FPS games. However, in addition to sliding forward/back/left/right, it would also have rotations: holding Select would move you in roll and pitch, while holding Do would move you in yaw. You would also be able to manipulate the panels as needed, by selecting and moving them (given the possibility of conflicts between these two functions, and the desire not to conceptually overload the mouse buttons unnecessarily, this design is not fixed). Zoom in and zoom out would straightforward matters of disconnecting, moving, then re-anchoring; in the case of boxes, one could thus travel into the box itself, which could have it's own virtuality, with it's own world-rules, separate from the rest of the system (this would be the natural way of designing games, among other things). While it would have a certain visual appeal, and scales on the learning curve - a user can learn the basics of the system at anchored panels without having to learn the roaming system - it would present some serious issues for intermediate users, as there would be a sharp discontinuity in the learning curve when the user shifts from the 'fixed single window' model to the 'free roaming docuverse' model.

Dynamically updated data would be referenceable using link daemons - functions that create new links as the datasets are updated. Since the data is minimally formatted, it should be possible to use it to source a variety of tools - for example, a given dataset might be quoted in a text document, used as a record field in an RBDMS, or used as data for constructing a pie chart. Since the documents are generated dynamically from the links, it is equally a 'part' of each, without losing it's own identity.

The user could set swap commands to switch between them, or 'disconnect' and roam through the space itself using the mouse like in many FPS games. However, in addition to sliding forward/back/left/right, it would also have rotations: holding Select would move you in roll and pitch, while holding Do would move you in yaw. You would also be able to manipulate the panels as needed, by selecting and moving them (given the possibility of conflicts between these two functions, and the desire not to conceptually overload the mouse buttons unnecessarily, this design is not fixed). Zoom in and zoom out would straightforward matters of disconnecting, moving, then re-anchoring; in the case of boxes, one could thus travel into the box itself, which could have it's own virtuality, with it's own world-rules, separate from the rest of the system (this would be the natural way of designing games, among other things). While it would have a certain visual appeal, and scales on the learning curve - a user can learn the basics of the system at anchored panels without having to learn the roaming system - it would present some serious issues for intermediate users, as there would be a sharp discontinuity in the learning curve when the user shifts from the 'fixed single window' model to the 'free roaming docuverse' model.
