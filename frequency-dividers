CML dividers have the widest locking range (LR) with a small chip area since no inductors are used. However, their operating frequency is typically below mm-wave frequency and suffers from high power consumption. On the other hand, Miller dividers can operate at higher frequencies with lower power consumption but narrower LR than CML dividers, whereas ILFDs are more suitable for mm-wave applications than the other two types due to their highest operation frequency and lowest power consumption. However, the conventional ILFDs suffer from a narrow LR because of the narrowband of the LC resonator, which is usually smaller than 20%."
