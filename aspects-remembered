As this was to be produced as a physical book, no links could be to pages not included in the garden, this had to be a 'walled garden'."

After a few attempts, we ended up with a tool that viewed the garden pages based on the links from each of the author's stories. These links were to 'gateway' pages for the garden, imagining that each of these pages were unique entryways into an interconnected set of pages that constituted the garden."
