The point I suppose is closer to \"as a rule of thumb, <b>do</b> use nested relations in derived relvars, but <b>don't</b> use them in base relvars\", which means there's less conflict than I had been thinking. I'm still not entirely happy with that, though, because I like things to be consistent and [[First Class]] in general, and did in fact just mention yesterday that I like the idea of using views fairly universally, and this advice would definitely demote views to second class citizens. It pierces the (hypothetical ideal) veil making base and view tables appear identical. -- [[Doug Merritt]]",

This quantity and type of rhetoric detracts from the purpose of this wiki in exactly the same way that spam detracts from the purpose of my email inbox. The analogy to spam is very close; both are pushed by people who rudely ignore the purpose of the venue. Both email and wiki spammers might argue that moving such topics to a less visible venue would deprive their message of attention, and they're right, and I'll even admit that there's an occasional legitimate lost opportunity to evoke someone's further curiosity on an important topic. I have occasionally gotten interesting spam in my email; but on principle I delete them without investigating further. The more common loss is the time spent to wade through the crud to find the legitimate email, which has a higher likelihood of relevance to my interests.",
