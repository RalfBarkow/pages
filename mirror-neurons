      "text": "The discovery of “mirror neurons” (Fadiga et al. 1995; Rizzolatti & Arbib 1998) indicates that in the neurobiology of the primate brain there appears to be a ground for systems that could have lent themselves to such an adaptation: mirror systems in humans that could support infant learning by virtual participation in the sound-producing gestures afforded by members of the speech community. This may be precursory of co-articulation later in ontogeny, for example, when two teenagers complete one another’s utterances from participant perception of what the other is about to say. This is accounted for in terms of an early model of simulation of mind in conversation partners (Bråten 1973a, 1974), introduced in Part I and returned to in Part III. Action understanding from the evoked matching observation/execution discharge in the observer, has been pointed to by the discoverers of mirror neurons as a main function of a particular class of premotor neurons. Having provided evidence of a mirror neurons observation/execution matching system in the human brain, they point out that such a system may serve as a basis of inter-individual relations, including imitative behaviour and social motor learning (cf. Fadiga & Gallese 1997; Gallese et al. 1996; Rizzolatti et al. 1999, 2000, 2002, 2006). The discoverers have demonstrated inter alia that muscle activation in human observers reflecting the kind of motoric act that is being observed indicates the extent of the mirror system resonance evoked. Gallese and Goldman (1998) indicate that such a resonant mirror systems capacity may afford a precursory path to mental simulation of other minds. Rizzolatti and Arbib (1998) suggest that such a resonant mirror system could serve as the basis of inter-individual gestural communication, including phonetic gestures and, hence, play a role in the phylogenesis of speech. The issue of how such a resonant mirror system for virtual participation in other’s activity may have been adapted in hominid phylogeny to subserve reciprocal interaction and understanding, was actualized by this discovery of ‘mirror neurons’ and independently by the identification of infant altercentricity (Bråten 1997a, 1998a). At the Delmenhorst symposium in 2000, organized by Gallese and Stamenov, the evolutionary implications for brain and language were pursued, including this question:"
