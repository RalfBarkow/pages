As a concept of mediatorless political unity, the racket stands in contrast to the legally mediated dialectical unity of the separate spheres of state and society inherent in bourgeois society. Therefore, the racket society can also be understood as a post-bourgeois society. In it, the particular mode of reflexivity is lost, which is essential to bourgeois society and, in particular, also anchored in law: the society of rackets functions solely according to the mode of [[inclusion]] and [[exclusion]]. Thus, the racket represents a concept of the political that is reminiscent of the friend-foe definition of the National Socialist constitutionalist Carl Schmitt. This also includes the question of the extent to which one can still speak of a state at all here, which is, after all, the political form of bourgeois society."
