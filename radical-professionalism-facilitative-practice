Broadening this out, I have a sense of a family of emergent altered relations of production, in the field of cultural production, as follows:\n- *Organic intellectual practice* - Was highlighted for example in the 70s by Illich as ‘vernacular’ capability, in *Tools for conviviality* and *Deschooling society*. Organic intellectual practice is a discovery of the Fordist era ::\\[Gramsci xxx]:: which stands in opposition to the professional-managerial class of Fordist and post-Fordist society. Also, in opposition to revolutionary vanguard, priestly caste, bardic elite, etc, and the ‘collectivist’ stream of socialist aesthetics.\n- *Free association, self-organising*. These are highlighted for example by Paulo Freire in his practice of conscientisation, which stands in opposition to the authoritative State, and the nanny State. It is not-the-cultural-industries. This mode is a discovery of the working class, with mutuals, coops, soviets and communes. Proto-socialist associationism ripples on as ‘global civil society’ (with its contradictions s, including ‘collectivism’).\n- *Commoning* - the curating, stewarding and enjoying by all members, of material or cultural resources - is highlighted by the contemporary movement for commons. Michel Bauwens and the Peer-to-Peer Foundation promote a perspective founded in P2P production organisation, which is a discovery of the post-post-Fordist period. P2P asserts the primacy of the mutual sector. The Commons Strategies Group and Commons Transition ::\\[Commons Transition xxx]:: are more centrally oriented to mutuality in the associationist sense; Bauwens is a co-founder of CSG but David Bollier & Silke Helfrich have done the anthropological fieldwork and specifically emphasise stewarding as the pivot (of which, the ‘agile’ P2P mode is a somewhat tech-reductionist, geek-elite version) ::\\[Bollier & Helfrich xxx]::. Commoning stands in opposition to the enclosing bureaucratising State, the consumerist individualist patriarchal household, and the capitalist monetising market; it constitutes the deepest kind of alternative to the status quo of provisioning for subsistence and wellbeing.\n- *Facilitation* is one of the great political discoveries of the educated baby-boomer, post-Fordist activist generation - an extension of rank-&-file labour movement activism into community development and disciplined, fluent self-reflection on means and ends. Facilitation stands for the autodidact and in opposition to preconceptualisation and managerial hierarchy. It’s a close cousin of organic intellectual practice (all of these RoPs here are close kin) but highlights the active cultivating of capability and insight as a skilled, situated practice in its own right. It’s part of the zeitgeist of mid C20 Human Potential, person (child)-centred learning and the ‘reflective practitioner’ aesthetic ::\\[Schõn xxx]::.\n- *Participatory design of infrastructure* - Communities of participatory design began to develop particularly in the 80s, with precedents in organic-intellectual and facilitative practice, and the free-association traditions, but but broadened and deepened; and became more visible with the advent of post-Fordist IT infrastructure, when entire work-infrastructures (and later, systems of ‘platforms’) could be generated from the design office and, later, by hacking. Participatory design is anti-statist and anti-corporate, and continues to sprout new forms; for example ‘social innovation’ circles as pioneered by Participle \\[[http://www.participle.net/]], and the design justice movement in the USA. The movement that promotes strict P2P protocols in web and open apps architecture is a version of participatory design also, but permeated by a hacking aesthetic - which is another thing, I would say, standing in a problematic relationship with ‘design’. Capability in protocolling, however, is fundamentally important in infrastructuring; a concern of the Faculty of stewarding.\nAll these emergent altered relations of cultural production - that is, production of radical labour power - require instantiation in patterns of landscape §2."
