        "text": "Pattern writing is a creative, iterative process. For new pattern authors, however, it is of-\nten not obvious where to start and how to proceed. Although well-written patterns typic-\nally follow a strict format, the number of available formats push first-time authors right at\nthe start to choose a specific format without knowing its advantages and liabilities. Fur -\nthermore, new pattern authors are often not aware that the order in which a pattern is\npublished typically is not the best order in which to write the pattern.\nDone the right way, writing a pattern often creates unforeseen insight into a domain one\nwas sure to know very well. The pattern structure encourages you to think more deeply\nabout the actual problem that the pattern solves and what consequences arise by applying\nthe solution. And by following an iterative approach you gain new insights in each cycle.\nThis paper aims at smoothing the learning curve of pattern writing by proposing a step-\nby-step guide that enables you to write a pattern in a simple but complete format. The\ngoal is to enable you to submit your pattern to a pattern conference.\nThe paper is divided into two parts. Part I is a warming-up. It presents the transcript of a\nconversation about a pattern and shows how knowledge of a fascinating solution slowly\ntransforms into a pattern. Part II contains the actual step-by-step guide how to write a\npattern."

This initial submission will be assessed for suitability, and accepted papers will be assigned to a shepherd.\n\n    Shepherding Phase (starting in March)\n    During shepherding, a shepherd (an experienced pattern author) helps you improve your paper by asking questions and giving feedback. Usually, this takes about four months and involves multiple iterations of feedback loops.\n\n    Second Draft (May)\n    Halfway through the shepherding process, you submit a second draft of your paper. This second draft will be reviewed for improved quality and your willingness and openness to consider and incorporate the shepherd’s feedback. This review will determine whether your paper is accepted to the conference and the ACM proceedings.\n\n    Conference Version and Preparation for the Conference (June)\n    After your paper is accepted for the conference, you and your shepherd can continue working on your paper. However, a few weeks before the conference, a final draft must be submitted to be distributed to the other workshop participants. Shepherding ends here.\n\n    Feedback (June)\n    You will receive the papers for your workshop about two weeks before the conference. Your task is to read and annotate it, to be able to give the author constructive feedback during the Writers’ Workshop at the conference. Usually, the annotated version is handed over to the author during the conference.\n\n    Conference (July)\n    A peer group of five to ten pattern authors will discuss your paper at a Writer’s Workshop at the conference, where you will receive a lot of feedback and suggestions for improvement for your paper. For every paper, at least one unique author has to attend the conference to collect the feedback.\n\n    Proceedings Version (September)\n    After the conference, you have to incorporate the suggestions for improvement which you received during the Writer’s Workshop at the conference and submit it a few months later as the final proceedings version, which goes to the ACM Digital Library.\n\n    Optional: TPLoP\n    By being accepted to a PLoP conference and going through all the improvement steps and the Writer’s workshop, your paper qualifies for submitting to the Springer journal LNCS Transactions on Pattern Languages of Programming (TPLoP). To be accepted, the paper has to be extended substantially beyond the original conference paper.\n\n"
