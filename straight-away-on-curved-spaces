Es ist nicht so einfach, sich in allgemein gekrümmten Räumen zurechtzufinden! Die Reduktion gekrümmter Formen auf pForms ermöglicht die Definition einer einfachen Geometrie in gekrümmten Formen, beginnend mit eingetauchten Segmenten, und bietet wertvolle alternative geometrische Werkzeuge, die einfacher zu definieren, zu manipulieren und zu kombinieren sind. Diese Werkzeuge können dabei helfen, direkt in gekrümmten Formen zu fliegen, die Figuren der klassischen Geometrie aus einem anderen Blickwinkel wiederzuentdecken, beim Verständnis moderner Theorien in der Geometrie zu helfen, die für den Nicht-Mathematiker so oft unzugänglich sind, und vielleicht ein Fenster zu neuen Theorien zu öffnen (Abbildung 24)..."

        "text": "Geodätische Linien, gefolgt von dünnen Brettern auf gekrümmten Oberflächen, komplexe mathematische Kurven wie Dreiblattknoten, funikulare Kurven, die den Aufwand optimieren, sind sicherlich die wahren Lösungen, aber sie sind mit einer Menge mathematischer Komplexität verbunden, die es schwierig macht, sie zu verstehen, zu kontrollieren und für den Bau neuer geometrischer Objekte zu verwenden. Es ist nicht so einfach, sich in allgemein gekrümmten Räumen zurechtzufinden! Die Reduktion gekrümmter Formen auf pForms ermöglicht die Definition einer einfachen Geometrie in gekrümmten Formen, beginnend mit eingetauchten Segmenten, und bietet wertvolle alternative geometrische Werkzeuge, die einfacher zu definieren, zu manipulieren und zu kombinieren sind. Diese Werkzeuge können dabei helfen, direkt in gekrümmten Formen zu fliegen, die Figuren der klassischen Geometrie aus einem anderen Blickwinkel wiederzuentdecken, beim Verständnis moderner Theorien in der Geometrie zu helfen, die für den Nicht-Mathematiker so oft unzugänglich sind, und vielleicht ein Fenster zu neuen Theorien zu öffnen (Abbildung 24)..."
