The re-description of what has already been described leads almost automatically to the training of an attention for \"frames\", for schemes of observation or even for conditions that lead to the text offering certain descriptions and not others. In doing so, it is useful to always consider: What is not meant, what is excluded, when something specific is asserted? If there is talk about \"human rights\": From what does the author distinguish his statements? From inhuman rights? From human obligations? Or culturally comparatively or historically from peoples who know no human rights and can live with it quite well?"

But we are brought up to expect something useful from our activities and otherwise quickly lose heart. Therefore, one should consider whether and how to prepare the notes in such a way that they are available for later access, or at least this is a comforting illusion in front of one's eyes. This requires a computer or a note box with numbered notes and a keyword index. The ongoing \"filing\" of the notes is then another work process that takes time; but also an activity that goes beyond the mere monotony of reading and, as it were, incidentally trains the memory."

Obviously, this differentiation in all its fields has been fascinated by the printing of books.

But we are brought up to expect something useful from our activities and otherwise quickly lose heart. Therefore, one should consider whether and how to prepare the notes in such a way that they are available for later access, or at least this is a comforting illusion in front of one's eyes. This requires a computer or a note box with numbered notes and a keyword index. The ongoing \"filing\" of the notes is then another work process that takes time; but also an activity that goes beyond the mere monotony of reading and, as it were, incidentally trains the memory."

The answer is only that this requires extensive recourse to what is already known, i.e. long-term memory. This does not form by itself. Perhaps reformulating writing is a suitable method for this; and this even if one has to postpone the hope of scientific productivity for a while."

This is true for the modern novel, for sophisticated (one could almost say multimedia) poetry, but also for scientific journalism. Obviously, this differentiation in all its fields has been fascinated by the printing of books. It may be that now, especially in view of the possibilities offered by the computer, we need to return more to the intrinsic achievements of writing."
