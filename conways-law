Instead, usually, [[Conways Law]] comes into effect - the product is now divided into two modules - A and B with team A working on A and team B on B. They might unify it at the UI layer, but the architecture is still messy because it reflects the organization structure (the presence of two teams) instead of the technical reality.

The term [[Open Source]] only looks at the product of the process (the source code), but it doesn't understand the process itself. The reason why developers feel compelled to release the source code is that they have to co-operate with developers they will never meet or know about. Or in other words, developers need the source code to the programs they are working on (that's a <i>duh</i>). When developing software for the Internet, this problem is very acute. It's impossible to develop a [[Network Standard]] such as SMTP without having some sort of open source reference implementation. However, once viewed in this frame, open source is no longer a zero or one proposition. One can release source code only to people one wants to include on the project, which is where the concept of community source arises. Finally, within an open source project, one can often tell the actual power structure by the degree of modularization; in particular, one can tell the places of greatest interest, or why the groups of people have come together, by seeing what parts have been most fully developed and made most flexible and with the most backwards compatibility. -- [[Sunir Shah]]",

The term [[Open Source]] only looks at the product of the process (the source code), but it doesn't understand the process itself. The reason why developers feel compelled to release the source code is that they have to co-operate with developers they will never meet or know about. Or in other words, developers need the source code to the programs they are working on (that's a <i>duh</i>). When developing software for the Internet, this problem is very acute. It's impossible to develop a [[Network Standard]] such as SMTP without having some sort of open source reference implementation. However, once viewed in this frame, open source is no longer a zero or one proposition. One can release source code only to people one wants to include on the project, which is where the concept of community source arises. Finally, within an open source project, one can often tell the actual power structure by the degree of modularization; in particular, one can tell the places of greatest interest, or why the groups of people have come together, by seeing what parts have been most fully developed and made most flexible and with the most backwards compatibility. -- [[Sunir Shah]]",
