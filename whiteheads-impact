        "text": "Whitehead's masterpiece _Process and Reality_ was published in 1929. In this book he declared a clear break with the materialism of Descartes, pointing to something he called 'Organic Realism', the foundation of a new Process Philosophy:\n>We diverge from Descartes by holding that what he has described as primary attributes of physical bodies, are really the forms of internal relationships between actual occasions. Such a change of thought is the shift from materialism to Organic Realism, as a basic idea of physical science.\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_and_Reality wikipedia]"
