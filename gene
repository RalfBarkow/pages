      "text": "A ‘gene' is a fundamental concept within genetics; however, current literature concludes that its boundaries are more fluid than originally anticipated. Mattick and co-workers (2010) excellently argue why the classical definition no longer works, stating that '*Not only is there pervasive transcription of the genome, but also a complex mixture of overlapping, interleaved and bidirectional coding and non-coding, sense and ‘antisense’ transcripts expressed from most loci* ...’ (p. 26). Preparing a new definition is not easy. Strachan and Read (2011, p. 12) suggest the following definition for human genome: ‘*Genes are discrete DNA segments that are spaced at irregular intervals along the DNA sequence and serve as templates for making complementary RNA sequences (transcription)*'. If ‘discrete’ implies mutual exclusivity, then the implications of this definition are (1) that overlapping genes and genes within genes are excluded; (2) that the DNA sequence may contain relevant regions that are not included in any gene (non-transcribed sequences) and hence, not counted; (3) the gene ‘header’, like its promoter and activator sites, is not included within the gene itself."

For verification of this premise, the knowledge domain of human molecular genetics was used in a study called ATCG. The Matrix’s seven functions and its fractal principle were applied using the latest (at the point of writing, i.e. up to the beginning of the year 2013) original scientific literature as the source of domain information. ATCG was elaborated through all seven functions with each further explored through its level of micro-functions. The Mereon Matrix was extremely useful in modelling as it constantly forced authors to pose specific questions with respect to the topics inherent at different micro-functions. This allowed searching for answers in the literature using an iterative and incremental modelling process. Upon completing the project it was concluded that the Mereon Matrix as a template for modelling human molecular genetics met and exceeded what was anticipated."
