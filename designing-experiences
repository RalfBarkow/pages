An example, and fond memory of mine, is taking groups on night walks in the tropical rainforests of North Queensland, getting everyone to turn torches off, and listening to the responses of wonderment and awe as eyes adjusted and the luminescent fungi dominated the forest floor."

Another's individual [[Surprise and Delight]], their personal [[Joy Felt]]. I couldn't demand, or plan for a Eureka Moment to happen, but I could try to set the conditions for it to be more likely to happen. There may be specific elements 'taught' in an explicit teaching sense, but the 'learning' is deeply personal."

It's not delivering content knowledge in the traditional 'big jug little jug' scenario that is important but allowing individuals to make meaning of that knowledge for themselves such as through the use of [[Learning Circles]] for listening and building deliberate time for reflection into programs. Our first nation's people know this as [[Dadirri]]."
