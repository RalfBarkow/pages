An example, and fond memory of mine from my past, is taking groups on night walks in the tropical rainforests of North Queensland, getting everyone to turn torches off, and listening to the responses of wonderment and awe as eyes adjusted and  the luminescent fungi dominated the forest floor."

Another's individual [[Surprise and Delight]], their personal [[Joy Felt]]. I couldn't demand, or plan for a Eureka Moment to happen, but I could try to set the conditions for it to be more likely to happen. There may be specific elements 'taught' in an explicit teaching sense, but the 'learning' is deeply personal."

Opening [[Multiple Windows]] for others to sense possibilities, building in experiences to surprise an delight, but allowing the journey to unfold in deeply personal ways, has become a primary focus in my professional learning work. It is perhaps more difficult in one day workshops than a two week study tour, but is achievable."

Its not delivering content knowledge in the traditional 'big jug little jug' scenario that is important, but  allowing individuals to make meaning  of that knowledge for themselves that is important. It is both horizontal and vertical development that is important. An example is incorporating the use of [[Learning Circles]] for listening and building deliberate time for reflection into programs. Our first nations people know this as [[Dadirri]]."
