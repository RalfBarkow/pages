Too often in education, and probably other fields, a term assigned to a practice travels through the community losing its fidelity as it does. The idea might be a valuable one, but the term, the label attached to the idea, can soon become ubiquitous. As it is increasingly used it becomes less potent because the meaning is diluted."
