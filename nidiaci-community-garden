We discovered that in 1920, the American Red Cross\n(literature lovers will remember Hemingway and Dos Passos with the ARC in World War I) gave funds \"to an\nEntity\" which \"should deal with popular instruction and education, with special attention to children\". The sum was invested in the purchase of this garden and buildings around it.\nThrough neglect on the part of the authorities, part of the property fell into the hands of real estate speculators with considerable funds of unknown origin, who are turning the buildings into luxury flats and the garden into a parking lot."

Some of those activities include:\n- Hosting the only self-managed football school in town, where children learn to enjoy playing and not\njust winning;\n- English lessons by a British writer;\n- Violin lessons by a Portuguese musician;\n- Open exchanges of children's clothes for free by parents, to avoid waste;\n- Managing a small community garden;\n- Work on monitoring pollution and traffic using equipment provided by the National Research Council;\n- And much else."

It may sound \"reactionary\", but being open to the global world would wipe us out in a few minutes. Since we are able to protect us against thousands of unknown people we have no relationship to coming in and taking the area over, we have no problem whatsoever with the ethnic or religious background of people we know and have a relationship with. I think this is very important in these days, because this is where the Commons give an answer to the dilemma \"globalization vs xenophobia\" which is such a feature of our times.\n> In the new version of our Convention, we solved the problem by saying that the garden is open to ALL children and those accompanying them, and to those carrying out activities at the garden. This avoids any discrimination, while at the same time leaving us the right to tolerate decent people who don't fit into these categories, and expel troublemakers.\n>\n> 2) We have decided to do everything legally and generally avoid confrontation with the authorities, while occasionally showing we can mobilize and protest.\n> This implies total independence from both majority and opposition politicians, whom we treat in the same polite manner, asking both to help us when necessary and giving nothing in return. The authorities know they have nothing to fear from us, but at the same time everything to lose if they go against us, because of the very broad support we enjoy.\n>\n> 3) Another complex issue (related to the first) is that legally \"every Italian\" or \"every European\" has \"the same rights everywhere all the time\". A fine idea in principle, which also means that any Frankfurt based multinational corporation intent on making biofuels has \"the same rights\" as a Polish farmer to Polish farmland; and any entrepreneur who wants a nice green space to hold fashion shows has the same right to \"our\" garden as we do: there is no reason why Amici del Nidiaci should manage the garden and not Gucci Moda, also because a Comune which lets other use government property has to show that they somehow gained an advantage by doing so, and Gucci Moda can certainly give the Comune more money than we can.\n> To contrast this, we managed to introduce two concepts into the \"patti per la gestione dei beni comuni\" of the Comune di Firenze: la territorialità e la gestione democratica.\n>\n> Enough said!\n>\n> Miguel "

It may sound \"reactionary\", but being open to the global world would wipe us out in a few minutes. Since we are able to protect us against thousands of unknown people we have no relationship to coming in and taking the area over, we have no problem whatsoever with the ethnic or religious background of people we know and have a relationship with. I think this is very important in these days, because this is where the Commons give an answer to the dilemma \"globalization vs xenophobia\" which is such a feature of our times.\n> In the new version of our Convention, we solved the problem by saying that the garden is open to ALL children and those accompanying them, and to those carrying out activities at the garden. This avoids any discrimination, while at the same time leaving us the right to tolerate decent people who don't fit into these categories, and expel troublemakers.\n>\n> 2) We have decided to do everything legally and generally avoid confrontation with the authorities, while occasionally showing we can mobilize and protest.\n> This implies total independence from both majority and opposition politicians, whom we treat in the same polite manner, asking both to help us when necessary and giving nothing in return. The authorities know they have nothing to fear from us, but at the same time everything to lose if they go against us, because of the very broad support we enjoy.\n"

A fine idea in principle, which also means that any Frankfurt based multinational corporation intent on making biofuels has \"the same rights\" as a Polish farmer to Polish farmland; and any entrepreneur who wants a nice green space to hold fashion shows has the same right to \"our\" garden as we do: there is no reason why Amici del Nidiaci should manage the garden and not Gucci Moda, also because a Comune which lets other use government property has to show that they somehow gained an advantage by doing so, and Gucci Moda can certainly give the Comune more money than we can.\n> To contrast this, we managed to introduce two concepts into the \"patti per la gestione dei beni comuni\" of the Comune di Firenze: la territorialità e la gestione democratica.\n"
