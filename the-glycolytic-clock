A biochemical clock can organize in time the myriad intracellular processes as well as the interactions between individual cells in multicellular associations. A classic example is the process of association of millions of slime mold cells in the case of Dictyostelium discoideum, which leads to the formation of a multicellular aggregate and is controlled by spatial oscillations of cyclic AMP.\n2. for \"dissipation saving\" in the sense of reducing free energy losses compared to steady state.\n3. as a \"frequency generator\" for other oscillatory systems, allowing a variety of new dynamic states to be generated.\n4. as a \"random generator\" when chaos occurs, with the purpose of adapting the organism to new environmental conditions through trial and error. This function could be realized in chemotaxis and signal detection as well as in evolution.\n5. as \"information memory\" in the sense of a chemical memory element, when different dynamic states occur for a fixed set of control parameters. In these cases, the behavior of the system is determined not only by the values of the control parameters, but also by the prior history of the system. Analogous processes could determine the memory character of individual oscillators in neural networks. Each oscillator could be singularly bound to a single cell.\n6. as a \"carrier oscillation\" for endogenous low-frequency modulation. The observation of two different clock cycles in a simple dynamic process shows that the period of the carrier oscillation can be in the minute range and the modulating period in the hour range, which makes the old problem of the coupling of long-term and short-term rhythms understandable."
