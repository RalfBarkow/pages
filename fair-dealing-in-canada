The fair dealing clauses of the [[Canadian copyright law]] allow users to engage in certain activities relating to research, private study, education, parody, satire, criticism, review, or news reporting. With respect to criticism, review, and news reporting, the user must mention the source of the material, along with the name of the author, performer, maker, or broadcaster for the dealing to be fair."

Previously, a Quebec Court of Appeal in ''Les productions Avanti Cine Video v. Favreau'' (4 Aug 1999) had recognized that parody could potentially be a 'critique', however it refused to recognize the exception in that circumstance."

Procedurally, a defendant is required to prove that his or her dealing with a work has been fair; however, the fair dealing exception is perhaps more properly understood as an integral part of the Copyright Act than simply a defence. Any act falling within the fair dealing exception will not be an infringement of copyright. The fair dealing exception, like other exceptions in the Copyright Act, is a user's right. In order to maintain the proper balance between the rights of a copyright owner and users' interests, it must not be interpreted restrictively.</blockquote>"

A summary of the changes proposed by this bill in terms of fair dealing notes that C-32 \"expands the scope of the fair dealing exception at section 29 of the Act to include new purposes: education, parody or satire\". The stated aims of the revised bill were also to \"permit businesses, educators and libraries to make greater use of copyright material in digital form\". Bill C-32 had not passed by the time the minority Conservative government faced a vote of no-confidence and subsequently fell on March 25, 2011."

Simply put, the fair dealing amendment in Section 29 of Bill C-11 expands the first criteria for evaluating fair dealing - the Purpose of the Dealing - to include education, and parody or satire, in addition to research, private study, criticism and review."
