Although it is true that \"in the control of their own selectivity the mass media are autonomous\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 50), autonomy is by no means to be confused with arbitrariness. \"The impression must be created with all the means of a journalistic style of writing specially trained for this purpose, as if what has just passed is still present, still interesting, still informing\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 55). On the organizational level, this leads to professionalization with its own training courses, job titles, and \"criteria of good work\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 55). Of course, not everything that is true or has occurred is also new, interesting, or even informative. So there is specific selection: In order to be able to count on audience interest, the news should contain a surprise and the information communicated should be new, \"break with existing expectations\" or \"determine an openly held space of limited possibilities (example sports events)\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 58). One can also find out about current stock market prices, weather forecasts, or the television program every day in the newspapers. Luhmann names - besides novelty - a whole series of other \"selectors\" that play a role in the \"selection of news\": Seriality, conflicts, quantities, norm violations, scandals, persons, locality, topicality, opinion, prominence, etc. (Luhmann 1997, p. 1100). These selectors and the mass media's general preference for news have consequences for the \"reality of their construction of reality\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 20), because it inevitably leads to a \"silencing of unexcited normality\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 143) - and, for that matter, of everyday scientific life, which is not ground breaking every day and produces a new paradigm (Schwanitz 1990), but consists of routines. Participation in the mass media, on the other hand, promises to \"escape the sameness of everyday life [...]\" (Luhmann 1990, p. 168), because reporting the same thing every day is not to be expected. Instead, one can rely on the fact that there is new news every morning and every evening (Luhmann 1997, p. 1097), which already in the 17th century, with regard to the first newspapers, fueled the suspicion that this \"serial production of news\" only comes about through \"fraud\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 54), because where should the constant stream of \"the surprising, the new, the interesting, the newsworthy\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 53) come from in an overall unspectacular everyday world?
