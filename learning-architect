I guess this makes perfect sense as I did become a teacher! But itâ€™s the work of [[Designing Experiences]] in which others may learn that brings me the greatest joy. In effect this is being an architect of learning, and my new role provided great opportunity to do this."

Like the ripples that emanate from a pebble tossed into a pond, the impact is undetermined and sometimes undetectable. I do think that professional learning is similar because who can say when a particular skill learned in a leadership program, or connections made with another leaders, may be important to a decision, or in a career?"

In the same way that building outlasts its architect, and the tradespeople that actually build it, there may be a subsequent and possible greater contribution made from the experience of working within the building's walls. That is, in the design of a building, the work that is done within its walls make a greater future contribution to humanity than the building itself."
