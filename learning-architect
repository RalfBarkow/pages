These situations often also offer me a [[Learning Gift]]. I guess this makes perfect sense as I did become a teacher! But itâ€™s the work of designing experiences in which others may learn that brings me the greatest joy. In effect this is being an architect of learning, and my new role provided great opportunity to do this."

Like the ripples that emanate from a pebble tossed into a pond, the impact is undetermined and sometimes undetectable. Professional learning is similar because it is unknown when a particular skill learned in a leadership program, or connections made with another leader, may be important to a decision, or in a career? The evaluation of impact, the need for a return on professional learning investment, are obstacles that get in the way of learning."

In the same way that building outlasts its architect, and the tradespeople that actually build it, the subsequent contributions made from the experience of working within the building's walls is expected. To put it another way, in the design of a building the work that is done within its walls should be expected to make a greater future contribution to humanity than the building itself. In the same way the learning designed, the study tours, the experiences built into programs, will bring greater future contribution than the time spent in a day long professional development workshop.
