These situations often also offer me a [[Learning Gift]]. I guess this all makes sense as I did become a teacher! But itâ€™s the work of designing shared experiences in which others learn that brings me the greatest joy. This is being an learning architect, and my new role provided great opportunity to do this."

Like the ripples that emanate from a pebble tossed into a pond, the impact is undetermined and sometimes undetectable. Professional learning is similar because it is unknown when a particular skill learned in a leadership program, or connections made with another leader or new idea, may be important to a decision, or in a career? The evaluation of impact, the need for a return on professional learning investment, can be obstacles that get in the way of learning."

In the same way a building outlasts its architect, the ongoing contributions made from the experience of working within its walls that are important. It is the work done within its walls should be expected to make a greater future contribution to humanity than the building itself. In the same way the learning designed, the study tours, the experiences built into programs, will bring greater future contribution than the time spent in a day long professional development workshop.
