Like the ripples that emanate from a pebble tossed into a pond, the impact is undetermined and sometimes undetectable. Professional learning is similar because it’s unknown when a particular skill learned in a leadership program, or connections made with another leader or new idea, may be important to a decision, or in a career? The evaluation of impact, the need for a return on professional learning investment, can be obstacles that get in the way of learning."

Like the ripples that emanate from a pebble tossed into a pond, the impact is undetermined and sometimes undetectable. Professional learning is similar because it’s unknown when a particular skill learned in a leadership program, or connections made with another leader or new idea, may be important to a decision, or in a career? The evaluation of impact, the need for a return on professional learning investment, can be obstacles that get in the way of learning."
