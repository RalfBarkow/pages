Available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15475 [Accessed 4 March 2024]. \nHyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSA), is a promising framework for the development of cognitive architectures and artificial intelligence systems, as well as for technical applications and emerging neuromorphic and nanoscale hardware. HDC/VSA operate with hypervectors, i.e., distributed vector representations of large fixed dimension (usually > 1000). One of the key ingredients of HDC/VSA are the methods for encoding data of various types (from numeric scalars and vectors to graphs) into hypervectors. In this paper, we propose an approach for the formation of hypervectors of sequences that provides both an equivariance with respect to the shift of sequences and preserves the similarity of sequences with identical elements at nearby positions. Our methods represent the sequence elements by compositional hypervectors and exploit permutations of hypervectors for representing the order of sequence elements. We experimentally explored the proposed representations using a diverse set of tasks with data in the form of symbolic strings. Although our approach is feature-free as it forms the hypervector of a sequence from the hypervectors of its symbols at their positions, it demonstrated the performance on a par with the methods that apply various features, such as subsequences. The proposed techniques were designed for the HDC/VSA model known as Sparse Binary Distributed Representations. However, they can be adapted to hypervectors in formats of other HDC/VSA models, as well as for representing sequences of types other than symbolic strings.\narXiv:2112.15475 [cs]\n\nRACHKOVSKIJ, Dmitri A., 2022.

Available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/cmp-lg/9709008 [Accessed 31 March 2020]. \nThis paper presents a new approach for measuring semantic similarity/distance between words and concepts. It combines a lexical taxonomy structure with corpus statistical information so that the semantic distance between nodes in the semantic space constructed by the taxonomy can be better quantified with the computational evidence derived from a distributional analysis of corpus data. Specifically, the proposed measure is a combined approach that inherits the edge-based approach of the edge counting scheme, which is then enhanced by the node-based approach of the information content calculation. When tested on a common data set of word pair similarity ratings, the proposed approach outperforms other computational models. It gives the highest correlation value (r = 0.828) with a benchmark based on human similarity judgements, whereas an upper bound (r = 0.885) is observed when human subjects replicate the same task.\narXiv: cmp-lg/9709008\n\nJOHNSON, Jeff, DOUZE, Matthijs and JÉGOU, Hervé, 2017. Billion-scale similarity search with GPUs.. Online. 28 February 2017. arXiv. arXiv:1702.08734. [Accessed 5 September 2023]. \nSimilarity search finds application in specialized database systems handling complex data such as images or videos, which are typically represented by high-dimensional features and require specific indexing structures. This paper tackles the problem of better utilizing GPUs for this task. While GPUs excel at data-parallel tasks, prior approaches are bottlenecked by algorithms that expose less parallelism, such as k-min selection, or make poor use of the memory hierarchy. We propose a design for k-selection that operates at up to 55% of theoretical peak performance, enabling a nearest neighbor implementation that is 8.5x faster than prior GPU state of the art. We apply it in different similarity search scenarios, by proposing optimized design for brute-force, approximate and compressed-domain search based on product quantization. In all these setups, we outperform the state of the art by large margins. Our implementation enables the construction of a high accuracy k-NN graph on 95 million images from the Yfcc100M dataset in 35 minutes, and of a graph connecting 1 billion vectors in less than 12 hours on 4 Maxwell Titan X GPUs.

Available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15475 [Accessed 4 March 2024]. \nHyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSA), is a promising framework for the development of cognitive architectures and artificial intelligence systems, as well as for technical applications and emerging neuromorphic and nanoscale hardware. HDC/VSA operate with hypervectors, i.e., distributed vector representations of large fixed dimension (usually > 1000). One of the key ingredients of HDC/VSA are the methods for encoding data of various types (from numeric scalars and vectors to graphs) into hypervectors. In this paper, we propose an approach for the formation of hypervectors of sequences that provides both an equivariance with respect to the shift of sequences and preserves the similarity of sequences with identical elements at nearby positions. Our methods represent the sequence elements by compositional hypervectors and exploit permutations of hypervectors for representing the order of sequence elements. We experimentally explored the proposed representations using a diverse set of tasks with data in the form of symbolic strings.
