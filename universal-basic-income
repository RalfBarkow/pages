Since green energy will be scarce, some industries would have to shrink significantly or would be obsolete altogether. In particular, aviation, banks, insurance companies, car companies and parts of the chemical industry would not have much of a future (see Chapter 16). Millions of people would become unemployed and would have to find new jobs, for example in climate protection. This ecological transformation would only be possible in an orderly manner if the state steers and protects all those affected.\n\nThe British demonstrated during World War II how a government can effectively steer to radically transform the economy. As mentioned earlier, the government did not intervene in individual businesses at that time, but continued to leave it up to owners and managers to decide how they wanted to run their businesses internally. The government only determined what was produced in the first place - and how much. The factories were then allocated the necessary labor and raw materials to meet government goals. The British government thus steered indirectly by allocating rare resources in a targeted manner.\n"
