It might seem unnecessary to reproduce an actual picture of randomly distributed stars and zeros and blank squares; but some of the results are going to be judged impressionistically, and it is worthwhile to get some idea of the kind of picture or pattern that emerges from a random distribution. If one insists on finding 'homogeneous neighborhoods' in this random distribution, he can certainly do so. Randomness is not regularity. If we are going to look at 'segregated areas' and try to form an impression of how segregated they are, or an impression of how segregated they look, we may want a little practice at drawing neighborhood boundaries in random patterns."

It might seem unnecessary to reproduce an actual picture of randomly distributed stars and zeros and blank squares; but some of the results are going to be judged impressionistically, and it is worthwhile to get some idea of the kind of picture or pattern that emerges from a random distribution. If one insists on finding 'homogeneous neighborhoods' in this random distribution, he can certainly do so. Randomness is not regularity. If we are going to look at 'segregated areas' and try to form an impression of how segregated they are, or an impression of how segregated they look, we may want a little practice at drawing neighborhood boundaries in random patterns."
