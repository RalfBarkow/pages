It is an ecosystem of physical spaces (residencies) structured to facilitate a novel and dynamic exchange of people (residents) and knowledge (value) between nodes of the network with open diffusion of value and resources to and from the surrounding (local) communities.\n\n\n![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_357EA359F3C0478BABF19F8D6DA3C1DCD5A8BA35FF2E34C7E54EFAAEBFE4F889_1569222816046_photo_2019-09-23+09.10.45.jpeg)\n\n\nA SPACE is a geographical area of consisting of a number of entities that form a sustainable ecosystem of working and living, organised in such a way using blockchain and open source software to facilitate coproductions and creative exchanges.\n\nLearning from the history of local currency design and B2B barter networks, we begin by mapping local organisations that have a strong interest in collaborating and exchanging people, skills and resources. This is particularly evident in software development, creative industries, education and training and local democratic engagement. \n\nEach SPACE is provided with software tools that enable the local mapping of these resources, and blockchain based tools that facilitate the creative exchanges, IP protection and cooperative governance of the network and the projects they undertake. Any organisation with an aligned social purpose is able to join the network and participate in its governance.\n\n\n![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_357EA359F3C0478BABF19F8D6DA3C1DCD5A8BA35FF2E34C7E54EFAAEBFE4F889_1569222919406_photo_2019-09-23+09.10.31.jpeg)\n\n\nThese zones or spaces, are geographically located, and will typically contain a hub, and a number of residency spaces (or pods). Additionally there may be a number of partner spaces, institutions and resources that have a structural relationship to the activities of the space and therefore the hub ecosystem.\n\n## Governance\n\nWe aim to launch the project with an initial focus on governance, which we define as the process with which groups of (human) beings come together make decisions and allocate resources. This is an overarching process that starts with conversation and ends with code (law as smart contracts). The SPACE network is designed to act as a set of physical laboratories with which we can test these processes and techno-legal software, and to this end we will be launching the network with a programme of legal and governance oriented hackathons.\n\nThe SPACE network currently consists of member spaces in the following geographical areas:\n\n\n- Barcelona\n- Dublin\n- Berlin\n- London\n- Liminal Village (Italy)\n- Seville\n- Madrid\n- Minsk\n\nWe have not officially launched the network or website yet. We will do this at the Democracy4All event on October 25-26 in Barcelona where we will be inviting other SPACES to join the network and become owner members of the projects that the network facilitates. In the lead up to the launch event we will be adding new venues and are currently interviewing spaces in Brooklyn, Geneva, Malaysia, and Brazil amongst others. Our aim is to grow slowly and establish links only with spaces that we can establish meaningful value exchanges with.\n\n# Aims of the Hub Ecosystem\n\nThe Hub Ecosystem is not a social or recreational network, rather it is designed to provide more creative and productive work environment for a certain type of scientist, digital knowledge worker or creative. It has a focus on creating an environment the enables long term sustainable work on complex problems that require an interdisciplinary approach.\n\nThere may be many such ecosystems, each with their own particular value systems, and focus. Each ecosystem would have a particular broad and interdisciplinary focus. Our software will be open source and designed for easy and agile forking. We envisage each autonomous ecosystem to develop its own culture and specialisation. Our aim is to make it easy for such cultures to sustain themselves, and in so doing generate many forms of shared commons.\n\n# Ontology\n\nA SPACE is hub surrounded by local residencies and resources useful for the production of shared value. Other forms of arrangement are possible, there may for instance be an ecosystem of different hubs, and some hubs may also be co-living spaces.\n\n## Hubs\n\nA hub is an (urban) co-working space, aligned to the purpose of the network. It is a type of co-working space, usually with event and co-living capabilities.\n\n![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/posts/images/QSGMOIquDxqQMI_lrYTiiu5J.jpg)\n\n\nHubs, act as a centre of organisation and focus for a wider network of residency spaces (pods) and institutional resources scattered in the surrounding local area. Hubs provide key infrastructure that enable these organisations to act in cooperation. They provide physical space for meetings, events and most importantly collaborative work (hackathons), but they also provide a digital infrastructure that helps organise and incentivise such collaborations.\n\nHubs are organised in the network, connected through decentralised protocols to create a spine or nervous system around which the network can organise itself. This enables the ecosystem to communicate with external (legal entities) and enables additional governance mechanisms surrounding conscious deliberations of purpose and longer term value.\n\n## Rural Hubs\n\nRural spaces have their own unique utility. The land is often cheap, and sometimes available free for social projects that bring social benefit to local communities. On the flip side internet connectivity in particular is often a problem, and expensive, which makes establishing a rural hub as a functional part of the network problematic.\n\n![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/posts/images/WQsJFod-fSLRa0e0BM6GCDzs.jpg)\n\n\nThere are a number of existing projects that we know of around the world that we can approach to join the network. Alternatively we can finance a new rural hub and design it specifically to meet the needs of the network.\n\nThis year, with the beginning of the rollout of 5g services there are opportunities to establish rural connectivity, and pilot p2p iOT networks. OFCOM the UK telecoms regulator lists the following priority in this years report:\n\n\n> Helping to improve mobile coverage, particularly in rural areas. We will explore a range of policy options and technologies for improving mobile coverage. We will prepare to award spectrum bands (700 MHz and 3.6 - 3.8 GHz) as they are cleared and released and will continue to develop proposals for new licence obligations that would require improvements in mobile coverage in rural areas.\n\nRural Hubs can provide enough space for larger groups as they begin new projects, hit bottlenecks or need to re-examine priorities. They can provide individuals with creative breaks away form the usual pressures, and the space and materials needed to work on larger scales. In short they provide a great deal of value to a network, but struggle to be sustainable due to problems of connectivity.\n\n## Pods (residency spaces)\n\nResidency spaces are places for artists, coders, makers, hackers, writers, film-makers etc to stay, sleep and rest. It is not necessary, but optionally of course useful, that these residency spaces provide space, tools, and good internet connectivity to enable residents to work remotely while remaining connected to other spaces and their previous social and work related connections.\nWe can envisage a relatively agile swarm of residency spaces coming and going around a more stable and longer term hub development. The hub spaces provide a meetings space, a co-working space and event space for the local network of residencies.\n\n\n![Artists, coders, writers, researchers… are able to exchange with other members where they are able to continue to work and plug into local networks and facilities that are useful to their work. These exchanges have minimal hard costs and are facilitated by the SPACE networks creative currency and governance mechanisms.](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_357EA359F3C0478BABF19F8D6DA3C1DCD5A8BA35FF2E34C7E54EFAAEBFE4F889_1569222816054_photo_2019-09-23+09.10.49.jpeg)\n\n# SPACE protocol\n\nThe effective functioning of this network requires a digital infrastructure that enables and incentivises the effective exchange of cultural product between entities. We aim to concentrate on first building this out for the physical spaces themselves, and then extending this to individuals and other groups that naturally synergise (or more precisely need) resources and skills from other members.\n\nSPACE stands for:\n\n\n    - **S**imple\n    - **P**rotocol for\n    - **A**ction\n    - **C**ooperation and\n    - **E**xchange\n\nThis means that we seek to build technology and legal templates (a techno-legal infrastructure) that supports and incentivises collaboration between spaces. Simple means that this protocol (or partnership) should be as simple as possible. We can achieve this by creating an initial **P**artnership **A**greement before migrating this to a **P**rotocol for **A**ction. That is we plan for an evolution of agreement complexity as the needs of the network (ecosystem) expand.\n\nWe describe this evolution of techno-legal form from an initial minimal state to its full and final form as a series of transitions between egg. caterpillar, and butterfly. It is important that we are clear about these stages from the start in order to avoid nasty surprises. It is also important to balance the simplicity and freedom of such agreements with flexibility, and the ability to govern complex ecosystems of members and interests. We accomplish this through the use of simple techno-legal structures, that can be cloned, customised and nested indefinitely in order to create the necessary level of governance complexity required, while preserving some of the simplicity and flexibility that we can achieve using human scale governance.\n\n## Ecosystem Maps\n\nStructurally we separate the physical space network from projects and activities. Like any “venue” the SPACE Network can programme a series of activities under a theme for a period of time or “season”.\n\nAs we are no longer speaking of a single venue, but an ecosystem of aligned venues, we need a structural language better suited to this complexity - reflecting the diversity of related but overlapping spaces and creative communities. Therefore we find it useful to think of ecosystem maps arranged in layers.\n\n\n![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_357EA359F3C0478BABF19F8D6DA3C1DCD5A8BA35FF2E34C7E54EFAAEBFE4F889_1569222816058_photo_2019-09-23+09.10.52.jpeg)\n\n\nEach layer represents a set of overlapping themes, arranged as an ecosystem of spaces, people and projects. A space may take part in more than one ecosystem at any given time, and no space need participate in a layer which does not interest them.\n\nThis requirement means that the techno-legal infrastructure must be easily forked and reconfigured for the needs of a new ecosystem map. We may start with a single simple layer, but as needed we expect groups to fork-off their own governance layers.\n\n## Activities (events)\n\nThe map also shows (in red) the flow of a regular cycle of activities connected to particular spaces or the network as a whole. We are proposing a natural flow of activities, that tie in modern project management processes (often inspired by agile / lean methodologies), institutional and natural rhythms.\n\nIn particular we are proposing an annual decentralised festival, or conference, which serves to bring together the spaces and act as a showcase of the work created in the previous year. This event will also act as a governance event for the network, enabling a new plan for the forthcoming year to be agreed and people and budgets allocated.\n\n![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_357EA359F3C0478BABF19F8D6DA3C1DCD5A8BA35FF2E34C7E54EFAAEBFE4F889_1569222816065_photo_2019-09-23+09.10.56.jpeg)\n\n\nThis annual event is described in more detail below, but it is important to state early that much of the purpose of this project is to redesign the way we govern, and organise ourselves. As such, and in common with other elements of this document we take some familiar and common cultural ingredients and blend them with technology and new ideas to create or recreate something new and unfamiliar. With regards this annual event it is both a serious governance milestone and a great party, with art, dance and food.\n\n## Purpse of the events\n\nThose of us with an engineering mindset, may see little purpose in such an event or \"party\" - however this is misreading the purpose of such an event. The purpose is quite simply to provide a clear project management infrastructure which is motivational to the diverse set of participants that we will need to build this network. This methodology has been evaluated over a number of years, and based on discussions and interviews with around a dozen co-living and co-working projects. It is not based on theory but on the evaluation of the practice of such organisations in the use of currency and governance mechanisms - particularly projects that involve a mix of technology, art and creativity and wider community engagement.\n\nThe combination of a larger annual cycle, punctuated by regular monthly or shorter cycles is a familiar, well tested and is readily amenable to combine with an agile development methodology. Regular monthly \"product-planning\" meetings which discuss progress with a wide range of stake-holders can readily be mapped to a podcast that helps grow the community and interest in the project.\n\nThe podcast and annual event can act as a key motivational factor for artists key to exhibit their work, and also act as a framework to engage in a slower overview of the direction of the project. In Googles GIST terminology the annual cycle provides an opportunity to refactor project goals, and select a series of step-projects and OKR's for the year. Each pod-cast production cycle can adopt agile methodology designed to showcase and receive objective feedback on the progress of the project from a diverse set of expert opinions (guests invited to the podcast).\n\nTherefore, our aim here is to place the annual event within the context of a series of regular sprints, punctuated by (product) planning meetings that act as opportunities to both manage product development (activities) and engage an audience of makers that can help us build and design complex systems. We call the regular events pod-casts, and they are described in more detail below.\n\n"

        "text": "## Governance\n\nWe aim to launch the project with an initial focus on governance, which we define as the process with which groups of (human) beings come together make decisions and allocate resources. This is an overarching process that starts with conversation and ends with code (law as smart contracts). The SPACE network is designed to act as a set of physical laboratories with which we can test these processes and techno-legal software, and to this end we will be launching the network with a programme of legal and governance oriented hackathons.\n\nThe SPACE network currently consists of member spaces in the following geographical areas:\n\n\n- Barcelona\n- Dublin\n- Berlin\n- London\n- Liminal Village (Italy)\n- Seville\n- Madrid\n- Minsk\n\nWe have not officially launched the network or website yet. We will do this at the Democracy4All event on October 25-26 in Barcelona where we will be inviting other SPACES to join the network and become owner members of the projects that the network facilitates. In the lead up to the launch event we will be adding new venues and are currently interviewing spaces in Brooklyn, Geneva, Malaysia, and Brazil amongst others. Our aim is to grow slowly and establish links only with spaces that we can establish meaningful value exchanges with.\n\n# Aims of the Hub Ecosystem\n\nThe Hub Ecosystem is not a social or recreational network, rather it is designed to provide more creative and productive work environment for a certain type of scientist, digital knowledge worker or creative. It has a focus on creating an environment the enables long term sustainable work on complex problems that require an interdisciplinary approach.\n\nThere may be many such ecosystems, each with their own particular value systems, and focus. Each ecosystem would have a particular broad and interdisciplinary focus. Our software will be open source and designed for easy and agile forking. We envisage each autonomous ecosystem to develop its own culture and specialisation. Our aim is to make it easy for such cultures to sustain themselves, and in so doing generate many forms of shared commons.\n\n# Ontology\n\nA SPACE is hub surrounded by local residencies and resources useful for the production of shared value. Other forms of arrangement are possible, there may for instance be an ecosystem of different hubs, and some hubs may also be co-living spaces.\n\n## Hubs\n\nA hub is an (urban) co-working space, aligned to the purpose of the network. It is a type of co-working space, usually with event and co-living capabilities.\n\n![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/posts/images/QSGMOIquDxqQMI_lrYTiiu5J.jpg)\n\n\nHubs, act as a centre of organisation and focus for a wider network of residency spaces (pods) and institutional resources scattered in the surrounding local area. Hubs provide key infrastructure that enable these organisations to act in cooperation. They provide physical space for meetings, events and most importantly collaborative work (hackathons), but they also provide a digital infrastructure that helps organise and incentivise such collaborations.\n\nHubs are organised in the network, connected through decentralised protocols to create a spine or nervous system around which the network can organise itself. This enables the ecosystem to communicate with external (legal entities) and enables additional governance mechanisms surrounding conscious deliberations of purpose and longer term value.\n\n## Rural Hubs\n\nRural spaces have their own unique utility. The land is often cheap, and sometimes available free for social projects that bring social benefit to local communities. On the flip side internet connectivity in particular is often a problem, and expensive, which makes establishing a rural hub as a functional part of the network problematic.\n\n![](https://static.slab.com/prod/uploads/posts/images/WQsJFod-fSLRa0e0BM6GCDzs.jpg)\n\n\nThere are a number of existing projects that we know of around the world that we can approach to join the network. Alternatively we can finance a new rural hub and design it specifically to meet the needs of the network.\n\nThis year, with the beginning of the rollout of 5g services there are opportunities to establish rural connectivity, and pilot p2p iOT networks. OFCOM the UK telecoms regulator lists the following priority in this years report:\n\n\n> Helping to improve mobile coverage, particularly in rural areas. We will explore a range of policy options and technologies for improving mobile coverage. We will prepare to award spectrum bands (700 MHz and 3.6 - 3.8 GHz) as they are cleared and released and will continue to develop proposals for new licence obligations that would require improvements in mobile coverage in rural areas.\n\nRural Hubs can provide enough space for larger groups as they begin new projects, hit bottlenecks or need to re-examine priorities. They can provide individuals with creative breaks away form the usual pressures, and the space and materials needed to work on larger scales. In short they provide a great deal of value to a network, but struggle to be sustainable due to problems of connectivity.\n\n## Pods (residency spaces)\n\nResidency spaces are places for artists, coders, makers, hackers, writers, film-makers etc to stay, sleep and rest. It is not necessary, but optionally of course useful, that these residency spaces provide space, tools, and good internet connectivity to enable residents to work remotely while remaining connected to other spaces and their previous social and work related connections.\nWe can envisage a relatively agile swarm of residency spaces coming and going around a more stable and longer term hub development. The hub spaces provide a meetings space, a co-working space and event space for the local network of residencies.\n\n\n![Artists, coders, writers, researchers… are able to exchange with other members where they are able to continue to work and plug into local networks and facilities that are useful to their work. These exchanges have minimal hard costs and are facilitated by the SPACE networks creative currency and governance mechanisms.](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_357EA359F3C0478BABF19F8D6DA3C1DCD5A8BA35FF2E34C7E54EFAAEBFE4F889_1569222816054_photo_2019-09-23+09.10.49.jpeg)\n\n# SPACE protocol\n\nThe effective functioning of this network requires a digital infrastructure that enables and incentivises the effective exchange of cultural product between entities. We aim to concentrate on first building this out for the physical spaces themselves, and then extending this to individuals and other groups that naturally synergise (or more precisely need) resources and skills from other members.\n\nSPACE stands for:\n\n\n    - **S**imple\n    - **P**rotocol for\n    - **A**ction\n    - **C**ooperation and\n    - **E**xchange\n\nThis means that we seek to build technology and legal templates (a techno-legal infrastructure) that supports and incentivises collaboration between spaces. Simple means that this protocol (or partnership) should be as simple as possible. We can achieve this by creating an initial **P**artnership **A**greement before migrating this to a **P**rotocol for **A**ction. That is we plan for an evolution of agreement complexity as the needs of the network (ecosystem) expand.\n\nWe describe this evolution of techno-legal form from an initial minimal state to its full and final form as a series of transitions between egg. caterpillar, and butterfly. It is important that we are clear about these stages from the start in order to avoid nasty surprises. It is also important to balance the simplicity and freedom of such agreements with flexibility, and the ability to govern complex ecosystems of members and interests. We accomplish this through the use of simple techno-legal structures, that can be cloned, customised and nested indefinitely in order to create the necessary level of governance complexity required, while preserving some of the simplicity and flexibility that we can achieve using human scale governance.\n\n## Ecosystem Maps\n\nStructurally we separate the physical space network from projects and activities. Like any “venue” the SPACE Network can programme a series of activities under a theme for a period of time or “season”.\n\nAs we are no longer speaking of a single venue, but an ecosystem of aligned venues, we need a structural language better suited to this complexity - reflecting the diversity of related but overlapping spaces and creative communities. Therefore we find it useful to think of ecosystem maps arranged in layers.\n\n\n![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_357EA359F3C0478BABF19F8D6DA3C1DCD5A8BA35FF2E34C7E54EFAAEBFE4F889_1569222816058_photo_2019-09-23+09.10.52.jpeg)\n\n\nEach layer represents a set of overlapping themes, arranged as an ecosystem of spaces, people and projects. A space may take part in more than one ecosystem at any given time, and no space need participate in a layer which does not interest them.\n\nThis requirement means that the techno-legal infrastructure must be easily forked and reconfigured for the needs of a new ecosystem map. We may start with a single simple layer, but as needed we expect groups to fork-off their own governance layers.\n\n## Activities (events)\n\nThe map also shows (in red) the flow of a regular cycle of activities connected to particular spaces or the network as a whole. We are proposing a natural flow of activities, that tie in modern project management processes (often inspired by agile / lean methodologies), institutional and natural rhythms.\n\nIn particular we are proposing an annual decentralised festival, or conference, which serves to bring together the spaces and act as a showcase of the work created in the previous year. This event will also act as a governance event for the network, enabling a new plan for the forthcoming year to be agreed and people and budgets allocated.\n\n![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_357EA359F3C0478BABF19F8D6DA3C1DCD5A8BA35FF2E34C7E54EFAAEBFE4F889_1569222816065_photo_2019-09-23+09.10.56.jpeg)\n\n\nThis annual event is described in more detail below, but it is important to state early that much of the purpose of this project is to redesign the way we govern, and organise ourselves. As such, and in common with other elements of this document we take some familiar and common cultural ingredients and blend them with technology and new ideas to create or recreate something new and unfamiliar. With regards this annual event it is both a serious governance milestone and a great party, with art, dance and food.\n\n## Purpse of the events\n\nThose of us with an engineering mindset, may see little purpose in such an event or \"party\" - however this is misreading the purpose of such an event. The purpose is quite simply to provide a clear project management infrastructure which is motivational to the diverse set of participants that we will need to build this network. This methodology has been evaluated over a number of years, and based on discussions and interviews with around a dozen co-living and co-working projects. It is not based on theory but on the evaluation of the practice of such organisations in the use of currency and governance mechanisms - particularly projects that involve a mix of technology, art and creativity and wider community engagement.\n\nThe combination of a larger annual cycle, punctuated by regular monthly or shorter cycles is a familiar, well tested and is readily amenable to combine with an agile development methodology. Regular monthly \"product-planning\" meetings which discuss progress with a wide range of stake-holders can readily be mapped to a podcast that helps grow the community and interest in the project.\n\nThe podcast and annual event can act as a key motivational factor for artists key to exhibit their work, and also act as a framework to engage in a slower overview of the direction of the project. In Googles GIST terminology the annual cycle provides an opportunity to refactor project goals, and select a series of step-projects and OKR's for the year. Each pod-cast production cycle can adopt agile methodology designed to showcase and receive objective feedback on the progress of the project from a diverse set of expert opinions (guests invited to the podcast).\n\nTherefore, our aim here is to place the annual event within the context of a series of regular sprints, punctuated by (product) planning meetings that act as opportunities to both manage product development (activities) and engage an audience of makers that can help us build and design complex systems. We call the regular events pod-casts, and they are described in more detail below.\n\n"

This is an overarching process that starts with conversation and ends with code (law as smart contracts). The SPACE network is designed to act as a set of physical laboratories with which we can test these processes and techno-legal software, and to this end we will be launching the network with a programme of legal and governance oriented hackathons.\n\nThe SPACE network currently consists of member spaces in the following geographical areas:\n\n\n- Barcelona\n- Dublin\n- Berlin\n- London\n- Liminal Village (Italy)\n- Seville\n- Madrid\n- Minsk\n\nWe have not officially launched the network or website yet. We will do this at the Democracy4All event on October 25-26 in Barcelona where we will be inviting other SPACES to join the network and become owner members of the projects that the network facilitates. In the lead up to the launch event we will be adding new venues and are currently interviewing spaces in Brooklyn, Geneva, Malaysia, and Brazil amongst others. Our aim is to grow slowly and establish links only with spaces that we can establish meaningful value exchanges with.\n\n\n"

It has a focus on creating an environment the enables long term sustainable work on complex problems that require an interdisciplinary approach.\n\nThere may be many such ecosystems, each with their own particular value systems, and focus. Each ecosystem would have a particular broad and interdisciplinary focus. Our software will be open source and designed for easy and agile forking. We envisage each autonomous ecosystem to develop its own culture and specialisation. Our aim is to make it easy for such cultures to sustain themselves, and in so doing generate many forms of shared commons.\n\n\n"

Hubs provide key infrastructure that enable these organisations to act in cooperation. They provide physical space for meetings, events and most importantly collaborative work (hackathons), but they also provide a digital infrastructure that helps organise and incentivise such collaborations.\n\nHubs are organised in the network, connected through decentralised protocols to create a spine or nervous system around which the network can organise itself. This enables the ecosystem to communicate with external (legal entities) and enables additional governance mechanisms surrounding conscious deliberations of purpose and longer term value.\n\n\n"

This event will also act as a governance event for the network, enabling a new plan for the forthcoming year to be agreed and people and budgets allocated.\n\n![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_357EA359F3C0478BABF19F8D6DA3C1DCD5A8BA35FF2E34C7E54EFAAEBFE4F889_1569222816065_photo_2019-09-23+09.10.56.jpeg)\n\n\nThis annual event is described in more detail below, but it is important to state early that much of the purpose of this project is to redesign the way we govern, and organise ourselves. As such, and in common with other elements of this document we take some familiar and common cultural ingredients and blend them with technology and new ideas to create or recreate something new and unfamiliar. With regards this annual event it is both a serious governance milestone and a great party, with art, dance and food.\n\n\n"

        "text": "## Purpose of the events\n\nThose of us with an engineering mindset, may see little purpose in such an event or \"party\" - however this is misreading the purpose of such an event. The purpose is quite simply to provide a clear project management infrastructure which is motivational to the diverse set of participants that we will need to build this network. This methodology has been evaluated over a number of years, and based on discussions and interviews with around a dozen co-living and co-working projects. It is not based on theory but on the evaluation of the practice of such organisations in the use of currency and governance mechanisms - particularly projects that involve a mix of technology, art and creativity and wider community engagement.\n\nThe combination of a larger annual cycle, punctuated by regular monthly or shorter cycles is a familiar, well tested and is readily amenable to combine with an agile development methodology. Regular monthly \"product-planning\" meetings which discuss progress with a wide range of stake-holders can readily be mapped to a podcast that helps grow the community and interest in the project.\n\nThe podcast and annual event can act as a key motivational factor for artists key to exhibit their work, and also act as a framework to engage in a slower overview of the direction of the project. In Googles GIST terminology the annual cycle provides an opportunity to refactor project goals, and select a series of step-projects and OKR's for the year. Each pod-cast production cycle can adopt agile methodology designed to showcase and receive objective feedback on the progress of the project from a diverse set of expert opinions (guests invited to the podcast).\n\nTherefore, our aim here is to place the annual event within the context of a series of regular sprints, punctuated by (product) planning meetings that act as opportunities to both manage product development (activities) and engage an audience of makers that can help us build and design complex systems. We call the regular events pod-casts, and they are described in more detail below.\n\n"

We will do this at the Democracy4All event on October 25-26 in Barcelona where we will be inviting other SPACES to join the network and become owner members of the projects that the network facilitates. In the lead up to the launch event we will be adding new venues and are currently interviewing spaces in Brooklyn, Geneva, Malaysia, and Brazil amongst others. Our aim is to grow slowly and establish links only with spaces that we can establish meaningful value exchanges with.\n\n\n"

We are proposing a natural flow of activities, that tie in modern project management processes (often inspired by agile / lean methodologies), institutional and natural rhythms.\n\nIn particular we are proposing an annual decentralised festival, or conference, which serves to bring together the spaces and act as a showcase of the work created in the previous year. This event will also act as a governance event for the network, enabling a new plan for the forthcoming year to be agreed and people and budgets allocated.\n\n![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_357EA359F3C0478BABF19F8D6DA3C1DCD5A8BA35FF2E34C7E54EFAAEBFE4F889_1569222816065_photo_2019-09-23+09.10.56.jpeg)\n\n\nThis annual event is described in more detail below, but it is important to state early that much of the purpose of this project is to redesign the way we govern, and organise ourselves. As such, and in common with other elements of this document we take some familiar and common cultural ingredients and blend them with technology and new ideas to create or recreate something new and unfamiliar. With regards this annual event it is both a serious governance milestone and a great party, with art, dance and food.\n\n\n"

It has a focus on creating an environment the enables long term sustainable work on complex problems that require an interdisciplinary approach.\n\nThere may be many such ecosystems, each with their own particular value systems, and focus. Each ecosystem would have a particular broad and interdisciplinary focus. Our software will be open source and designed for easy and agile forking. We envisage each autonomous ecosystem to develop its own culture and specialisation. Our aim is to make it easy for such cultures to sustain themselves, and in so doing generate many forms of shared commons.\n\n\n"
