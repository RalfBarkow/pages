In this sprint cycle he will put together a prototype design that highlights quotes. We discussed using Vista Print for printing and mailing. For small mailings (>50) cost is about $1 each. For larger (>1000) cost drops down to about $.50 each. We are looking to have both the new offering and campaign elements locked down in 2-3 then develop the service page in 2-4. We are planning on trying to launch the first pilot mailing before the end of 2-4."

        "text": "Met with Mic to discuss North Valley pilot campaign. Agreed that in the 2-3 sprint cycle I will create the initial draft of the campaign that can be reviewed with Eric and Mic. In this sprint cycle he will put together a prototype design that highlights quotes. We discussed using Vista Print for printing and mailing. For small mailings (>50) cost is about $1 each. For larger (>1000) cost drops down to about $.50 each. We are looking to have both the new offering and campaign elements locked down in 2-3 then develop the service page in 2-4. We are planning on trying to launch the first pilot mailing before the end of 2-4."

He has made some initial calls but unclear what the service we should be selling given that our standard packages are not very competitive against the DSL. Not sure if we should be adjusting this. Perhaps this might be an opportunity to roll out an EN offering if we can pull it together fast enough. "
