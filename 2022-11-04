Sometimes we can lose sight of creating value and get hung up with nice looking tools. Don't get me wrong, one of the reasons I'm all in with Gt is that there is an additional variable, let's call it joy, that gets enhanced when the tools I build look good, are visual when the context is best represented that way and not through text, and can in an ad-hoc way interact with many other domains. But let's be pragmatic and not lose sight of creating value for ourselves  and/or teams we support. Let's stay incremental. A simple tool/view is usually way better than NO tool. \n"

It's hard to let go of biases around sunk costs and trying to re-use or over-generalize tools to amortize tool-building costs, yet after going over a non-trivial learning curve, I've had less and less things to share with the community at times because some of my tools/views/queries are SO specific to my team/company\nThat's a testament to Gt being a platform where you can build such tools relatively cheaply.

Once you have a view, you can often write a method for use in the playground that does the associated editing. As long as your tool is for power users (such as yourself), that's often good enough for a very long time.\n\n\"Focus on solving problems and NOT building tools\". Great advice, but applicable only if you can build tools without focusing on that task. With most of today's software environment, that's simply not possible. And that means that most people have never experienced it.\n\n\"Tools become less shareable\": Yes, but at the same time more malleable. I suspect this is what Donald Knuth had in mind when he said that he very much prefers \"re-editable\" to \"reusable\" software (a short remark in an interview: https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856)\n\n\n"

In 2011, two of us ([[J√∏rgen Randers]] and Ulrich Gol√ºke) began a concerted effort to develop a system dynamics model to incorporate the investment needs that could help solve some of the existential challenges that World3 so effectively highlighted, particularly the inevitable non-profit spending needed to address the climate emergency. In the process, we failed to turn our work into a model for system dynamics, but we did successfully create a regionalized spreadsheet model called Earth-2 that supported the 2012 book *2052: A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years*.

It was inspired (of course) by the World3 model that underpinned the Limits to Growth study and, in different versions, the 1992 and 2004 follow-up studies. In 2011, two of us (Jorgen Randers and Ulrich Gol√ºke) began a concerted effort to develop a system dynamics model to incorporate the investment needs that could help solve some of the existential challenges that World3 so effectively highlighted, particularly the inevitable non-profit spending needed to address the climate emergency. In the process, we failed to turn our work into a model for system dynamics, but we did successfully create a regionalized spreadsheet model called Earth-2 that supported the 2012 book 2052: A Global Forecast for the Next 40 Years. In the following years, Earth-2 was progressively developed into the Earth-3 model that enabled the 2018 report Transformation is feasible!\"122 In parallel, we further developed the climate component of Earth-2 into a full-fledged system dynamics model of climate change in this century, which was published in 2016.\n\nThe (major) task of transforming these earlier models into a fully endogenous system dynamics model was completed in recent years as part of the Earth for All project and was named Earth4All."

You can fork them and if you add the github pages support, you can simply make your own installation of them. The first two can be cloned to your local computer, run npm install and npm start and you can run them locally. As of now, the Mythos world needs a bit of intervention after you run npm install: npm install overrides the custom behavior files with the stock one; so you have to revert two files git checkout behaviors/croquet/avatarEvents.js and git checkout behaviors/croquet/halfBodyAvatar.js before running (we will fix this issue soon)"
