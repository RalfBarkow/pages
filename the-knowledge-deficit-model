As a way to remedy this fractured relationship, there is a need to focus on the literacy of society, which should involve a greater understanding of basic scientific words and [[facts]], the general scientific process and the political issues related to science. However, although this model, known as [[the knowledge deficit model]] of science communication, persists in science and its public communication, it has been criticised and fundamentally reconsidered, in part, for being overly simplistic and ineffective and for positioning the public as sociologically incompetent.
