I ask the question: what could I learn from this text about how to go about my own research?  A more explicative approach might ask what does this text say, and how can I use its conclusions in my own writing?  Or more prosaically: what is the main argument of this text, what are its main supports and weaknesses, and what is potentially worth citing in the future by me?  The explicative approach is important and part of what we must attempt with all texts.  But my feeling reading the secondary literature that abounds about most key texts is that there are many plausible, competing accounts of the meaning of the text (including along the above set of dimensions) and that to engage at this level is a choice that involves one in a responsibility toward that secondary literature.  Also, I feel that this is not my strength for a number of reasons (most of this stuff is in translation from languages I don’t read, most of it is within traditions that I am inadequately trained in, most of the secondary literatures develop internal vocabularies and concerns that lie outside of my own research interests).  A methodological engagement with a text seems to offer me the most valuable way of learning from it (cf. Ranciere’s Ignorant Schoolmaster: one researcher engaging with another).\n\nI am very ambivalent about the notion of an ‘ethical’ right now – but that means that I am drawn to it in spite of my reservations and deep sense of the vagueness of what follows.  I call my mode of reading ethical because I am interested in how the arguments, concepts, and models that I draw out of a text can be read as being deployed against social things that one is opposed to.  A descriptive approach I would characterize as presuming a distinction between an argument and how it might be deployed.  This does not mean that I read arguments as having a necessary politics, far from it, but I do read them as deployed-arguments (within the text, and for my own purposes), they are articulated within a set of discourses and bodies (and abstracting them from these is to create a different argument).  Nor do I think that ethics is necessarily good: I read the book New Corporate Activism ethically in two ways: for how it articulates a coherent ethical position for the corporation (the person of the corporation), and then again for how it offers me a mode of thinking through the weaknesses of corporate tactics (their often dependence on cooperation among competitors for instance).  In 1000 Plateaus terms, I read texts ethically as order-words, as interventions (and not as descriptions, representations, or anything secondary to some primary reality).\n\nSo there you have what I hope is a helpful, considered analysis of my own reading practices at this moment.  I would really welcome any comments that come to mind, especially challenges, criticisms, additions, deletions, etc."
