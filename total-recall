This \"tech\" (aka McGuffin) turns out to be an instant terraforming device that, when activated, covers the entire fourth rock from the sun with breathable air. It should be noted that Arnold's steroidal hands fit the Martian hand-activation thingy just fine. [https://www.pcmag.com/news/from-mars-to-earth-the-tech-of-total-recall page]"
