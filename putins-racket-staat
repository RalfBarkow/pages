When Putin took office as president, the Russian state, and with it Russia as a commodity-producing society, appeared to be well on the way to collapse in the midst of the battle for the spoils waged by the various elites or rackets over the legacies of the Soviet Union, which were only interested in their own interests; the political and economic basis of capital accumulation appeared to be seriously threatened. Putin countered this tendency toward disintegration not by disempowering the rackets and integrating them under the rule of law, to the extent that this is at least possible within state forms of rule, but by placing himself at their head, but in such a way that he adapted to their rivalry with the arbitrariness of his political decisions."

This structure cannot be described as a mediating authority in the sense that it has formal generality and predictability, as is the case with law, for example, as [[Franz Neumann]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] understand it. The president's function as integrator of conflicting participatory interests is based entirely on his situational arbitrariness.

Lilia Shevtsova has equally observed in Putin's function the strange ambivalence that Neumann described in view of the National Socialist leader, according to which he appears on the one hand as the unchallengeable culmination of political power, but on the other hand at the same time as an authority that merely lends the necessary facticity to the decisions and compromises already made by the conflicting rackets. Accordingly, \"the question of who makes the decisions and who has more influence, the president or his entourage, loses its meaning.

In their arbitrariness, as can be observed in the Russian Federation at present, an elementary difference to National Socialism and to the Islamic Republic of Iran also becomes clear: In their scramble for power and booty, the cliques of the Russian Federation are not currently aligning themselves against the one \"total enemy\" that such regimes regard as \"the Jew\" or Israel. This also reflects the specific form of rivalry among the various power groups in the Russian Federation, a constellation in which Putin seems in many respects to be the only integrative component. Not only in view of the current decline in the price of oil and a possible widening of the economic crisis, however, there is always the danger that, with an escalation of social conflicts, the inherent logic of the racket society of the \"peacemaking \"94 of the one chosen enemy, i.e., that enemy determination with which Carl Schmitt associates the possibility of forcing a \"pacified ... or- ganized political unity \"95 , will unfold uninhibitedly, which in the final analysis is a logic of annihilation."
