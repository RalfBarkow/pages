      "text": "> This paper presents an approach to teach programmable logic controller (PLC) programming and industrial automation to students in Mechatronics Engineering program at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology. The first course, i.e. PLC Programming, introduces texted languages, such as instruction list and structured text, according to IEC61131-3 standard so that students can learn a fundamental concept about PLC hardware and software using the standardsbased programming languages. The advanced course, Industrial Automation, focuses on teaching students the sequence control concept and problem solving strategy, where Sequential Function Chart, Ladder Diagram and Function Block Diagram are used to put the design of industrial manufacturing assembly line into operation. The classes have been taught in project based approach and the kinesthetic learning style has been adopted throughout all laboratory sections. From students’ comments, the teaching approach was very successful. By the end of the academic year, students have developed their own various projects using the knowledge they learned from PLC Programming and Industrial Automation courses. Some of the projects have been further advanced as a student research paper published at the college technology day conference, ASEE regional conferences or the Latin American Caribbean Conference for Engineering and Technology. Moreover, these courses are intended to enhance career opportunities for the students in Mechatronics Engineering program. Currently some of our graduates have chosen their careers in the area of PLC programming and industrial automation.\n"
