However,\nhe claims that they do not show that time must have had a beginning. I argue that one\nof those arguments, the traversal argument, is unaffected by Sorabji’s major criticisms.\nSorabji fails to take account of the fact that the argument is not merely based on logical\nconsiderations, but on a theory of time."
