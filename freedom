However, commitment may be essential. But we must learn how to be committed without getting ahead of ourselves, without tipping our bodies or our minds. This form of balancing-commitment is a skill that can be learned. It seems that our bodies and our minds are in fact only one entity. Only when they are deeply understood, felt, to be integrated—in this embodied-mind form of freedom-to-move-with-circumstances—can we be one with the world beyond our skin.

In their art, the body and the mind are free to move in any direction at all times. They are never “committed”, meaning overcommitted, nor unbalanced. In these arts, over commitment is unhelpful. However, commitment may be essential. But we must learn how to be committed without getting ahead of ourselves, without tipping our bodies or our minds. This form of balancing-commitment is a skill that can be learned. It seems that our bodies and our minds are in fact only one entity. Only when they are deeply understood, felt, to be integrated—in this embodied-mind form of freedom-to-move-with-circumstances—can we be one with the world beyond our skin. If we live in the illusion of body mind separation, then we will inevitably be unbalanced in the world. And in our minds. And in our bodily movements. \n"
