Does it really help to say that, in some sense or other, Plato, Bishop Berkeley and Hegel were all Idealists? Pepper's classification scheme is more illuminating, and, fur ther, it helps us understand these various metaphysical positions by explaining their origins in their different root metaphors. \n> * Source: Duncan, Elmer H. 1980. “The Philosophy of Stephen C.
