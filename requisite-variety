Ross Ashby put it, \"requisite variety\" that would be necessary to establish a kind of matching, a kind of point-by-point relationship between system and environment. The system does not have the capacity to put its own state on top of everything that happens in the environment, to hold its own operation against it, either to promote or to prevent what happens, but it has to bundle or even ignore, it has to muster indifference or create special facilities for complexity management. In the discussion this became the formula that the system must reduce complexity, and this on the one hand in relation to the environment and on the other hand in relation to itself, if it wants to create planning instances or rationality agencies within itself. In the history of science, this problem can be traced back to the functionalist psychology of the 1930s. At that time, the limits of the input-output model or the stimulus-response model, as it was then called, were recognized. It was seen that one could not simply work with a one-to-one order of stimulus and response, but that between them there was something that provided the transformation and could not be reduced to a mathematical function."

According to a thesis of Donald McKay, a Scottish cyberneticist or information theorist, freedom arises under these conditions: Even if complex systems were machines and completely determined, each system would have to assume that the other can be influenced, i.e. react to signals, and this not in a way whose determinacy could be calculated in the system itself, but precisely in a way that is unpredictable. Therefore, you have to sweeten the information, so to speak, you have to offer incentives that you believe or know from experience that the other systems will get involved, that they will cooperate voluntarily, based on their own preferences, or, if you want to rule that out, that they will not cooperate, that they can therefore decide and are not already through-determined systems that do what they do anyway. The interesting hypothesis is that freedom comes from duplication of systems from determinacy. They must be more than one system, and they must be complexity inferior, that is, they must not have requisite varity. They have to interact and have to fake freedom in order to be able to bring themselves into a relation to another system. When this happens on both sides, freedom qua fiction becomes reality.\n\nI don't know what you think about that. In any case, it's a thing to think about, and it resolves a bit of the old discussion of whether the world is either determined or indeterminate. We are then again dealing with a paradox of the distinction: The world is indeterminate because it is determined, but this not centrally, but locally.\n"
