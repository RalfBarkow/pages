For technicians and planning theorists, the problem of complexity was the crucial problem at that time: planning runs on complexity, the planning entity stands outside of what it plans and does not have the \"requisite variety\" (Ashby), i.e. the possibility to assume as many states as what it plans or as the world outside. It must reduce complexity, as the formula is then called. It must try to find elegant solutions to much more difficult problems. It must simplify. It has to engineer, abstract, form models, and then try to control systems through such models.\n\nBut we had already noted - you may remember - in the part of the lecture that talked about complexity, that complexity is a selection constraint. If you describe complexity as a multiplicity of elements, not every one of which can be linked to every other, then there is a selection constraint built into complexity. Any pattern of actualizing complexity is selective: you can only talk to your superiors and you can only talk to your subordinates, but you can't talk to your colleagues. Certain things belong there, certain things belong here. A machine whose parts, screws, wheels, and rods are combined differently would no longer run; you have to put it together the way it's described in the instruction manual, there's no other way, although there might be other ways. Complexity is always a selection relationship that runs under certain criteria.\n\n"
