Marks are also docked for approaching a control point from the wrong direction.  The time is taken as the last member of the team to enter the control point, so team members need to keep together.

The competition lasts a full day (sometimes two days) and has three phases: (1) Parcours Orientation et Regularite (POR); (2)Maitrice des allures (MA) and (3) Parcours Terrain Varie (PTV).

It is the phase that carries the maximum points which can so easily be lost. It is about getting the whole team from point A to point B following a [[defined route at a target speed]].
