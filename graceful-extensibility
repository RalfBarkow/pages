      "text": "All systems have an envelope of performance, or a range of adaptive behavior, due to **finite resources** and **continuous change**.  There is a transition zone where a system shifts regimes of performance when pushed to the edge of its envelope.  Brittleness and graceful extensibility describe how the system responds while exceeding its envelope of performance.  Graceful extensibility refers to a systemâ€™s ability to adapt how it works to extend performance past the boundary into a new regime of performance invoking new resources, responses, relationships, and priorities.\n"

Between the three groups there are similar relationships of complement, contrast, and compounding. The diagram below over-simplifies these relationships. Like the systems these statements describe, things are much more entangled and woven together than any single model can capture. All models are wrong. We hope this model of the statements and groupings may be useful."

Between the three groups there are similar relationships of complement, contrast, and compounding. The diagram below over-simplifies these relationships.
