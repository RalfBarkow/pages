Sun objected, claiming that this approach locked the resulting programs into Microsoft platforms. This replayed the earlier similar conflict between Digitalk and [[Parc Place]] about using native GUI within Smalltalk (with [[Parc Place]] playing the role of Sun and Digitalk playing the role of Microsoft). The courts sided with Sun, and Microsoft responded by announcing [[Cee Sharp]]. I make no value judgement here, in fact I thought I said pretty clearly that I prefer a Java that uses the real native UI.

This replayed the earlier similar conflict between Digitalk and [[Parc Place]] about using native GUI within Smalltalk (with [[Parc Place]] playing the role of Sun and Digitalk playing the role of Microsoft). The courts sided with Sun, and Microsoft responded by announcing [[Cee Sharp]]. I make no value judgement here, in fact I thought I said pretty clearly that I prefer a Java that uses the real native UI.

Conversions/casts are very weak too, you can't convert a string[] to a [[String Collection]] or a List<string>. Features in one collection/list/array aren't present in the other. You cant even cast a string to an int without a library call. Strings are immutable, making you include instantiate a new class (stringbuilder). And the lack of string processing (which nearly every program needs heavily) makes it very verbose. A simple one-liner in VB or scheme takes 8 lines and a loop. It also holds the record for the ugliest and least useful switch command. You must use useless <b>break</b>s and you can only switch on int/strings.",
