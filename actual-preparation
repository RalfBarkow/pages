Fortunately, I do not need to answer the question whether the planning of an action is already part of the action that is being planned. Whether the imaginative playing through of an action already represents its first phase. Planning, however, is only the inner, so to speak, the fictional part of the preparation, a preparation that also includes outer, real parts: it is thus composed of the imaginative rehearsal action and real activities, namely activities that are effective in reality. And both for these real preparatory actions and for the preparation as a whole, the question arises again whether they are already a part of that action whose preparation they serve.\n"
