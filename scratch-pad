This enables continuous delivery of value to the customers, fast feedback loops, and fast learning. In such a setting,  business units, or product/service units replace the functional silos and the product/service team's backlog replaces the function's backlog.\n\nParadoxically forming an Agile Transformation Team or a team of Agile Coaches means adding one more functional silo, where team members pull the work from the functional silo backlog and not the backlog of the teams they are supporting as they should. Things sometimes get even worse when inside such a team there is a hierarchical order for example between \"Enterprise\" Coaches, Agile Coaches and Scrum Masters."
