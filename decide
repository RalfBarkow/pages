        "text": "To [[decide]] an alternative, to be able to designate its one but not its other variant, a decision needs information. Thus, apart from the alternative, there must be something else that presents itself as a choice from a marked or unmarked range of possibilities - precisely a difference that makes a difference, that is, that contributes to deciding the decision. But the reverse is also true: the decision generates the moment of surprise that can be communicated as information. The decision is then itself communicated as information, which can trigger further decisions. In this sense, the autopoietic context of decisions can be called information processing."
