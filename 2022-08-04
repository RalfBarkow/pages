Taiwan no longer receives sand from China.\n\nFrom today to Sunday, the Chinese People's Liberation Army plans to hold large military maneuvers in the waters off Taiwan. In fact, the plans for the maneuvers seem as if China is already rehearsing the encirclement and a complete sea blockade of the island. Just 180 kilometers of sea separate the main island of Taiwan from China.\n\nThe announced exercises will take place off the coasts of Taiwan's major cities, partly in the island's territorial waters – much closer than the threatening maneuvers of 1995/96, which many still remember today. Australian China researcher [[Nathan Ruser]] spoke on Twitter of an escalation and the \"most provocative moves by China in decades.\" Then on Wednesday afternoon, 27 Chinese fighter jets briefly entered Taiwan's air defense zone."

Especially now, when \"the world has to decide between democracy and autocracy,\" Pelosi said at her press conference in Taipei, solidarity with Taiwan is \"crucial.\"\n\nTaiwan, it seems to be gradually dawning on the West, is the most powerful thing standing between China's leaders and their claim that Chinese are not fit for democracy."

The unacceptable nuclear threats issued by Russia earlier this year in connection with its military aggression against Ukraine are yet another reminder of the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.\" Nuclear risks, he said, are greater than at any time since the end of the Cold War. That's why \"Switzerland wants to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons,\" Cassis said.\n\nOne step toward a nuclear-weapon-free world would be the signing and ratification of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. But Switzerland will still not sign the ban treaty. This is stated by the Foreign Ministry (EDA) in a communiqué. At least the Federal Council will reassess the Swiss position. This has been announced and \"will take place on the basis of a report by the administration and with the involvement of external experts,\" says EDA spokesman [[Pierre-Alain Eltschinger]]."

'We believe that publishers of XML documents will appreciate the advantages 3B2-FO delivers in terms of expanded functionality and the ability to produce higher quality documents compared to the other engines on the market. Should they eventually require even more comprehensive composition and pagination formatting capabilities, our high-end 3B2 software which is also fully XML compliant, is a logical upgrade path.' 3B2-FO is based on the composition and pagination formatting capabilities of Advent's 3B2 professional publishing software which has been in use in high end STM journal, legal, financial, book, and technical documentation publishing environments worldwide for over 16 years. Because it is based on this mature foundation, Advent expects its 3B2-FO software will provide an unprecedented level of performance and reliability... Advents global customer base includes The European Parliament, Boeing, GlaxoSmithKline, the US Patent and Trademark Office, Bertelsmann and the Canadian House of Commons. The Advent Group consists of Advent Publishing Systems UK (the parent company), Advent 3B2 GmbH (Germany), and Advent 3B2 Inc.(USA)...\" See also (1) the FAQ document [https://web.archive.org/web/20031005192352/http://www.advent3b2.com/index.php?section=general&sub=fofaq wayback]; (2) \"XSL/XSLT Software Support.

The unacceptable nuclear threats issued by Russia earlier this year in connection with its military aggression against Ukraine are yet another reminder of the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads.\" Nuclear risks, he said, are greater than at any time since the end of the Cold War. That's why \"Switzerland wants to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons,\" Cassis said.\n\nOne step toward a nuclear-weapon-free world would be the signing and ratification of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
