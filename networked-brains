A fine mist has settled on this web, capturing and scattering the sunrise, and thus our attention, as we walk on the narrow pavement after a few morning errands.  We were connecting various aspects of our life- a need for nutrition, water, personal care.  The spider's web met each of those same needs.  The gnats have been consumed and are no longer visible, most of the water droplets will evaporate, others already absorbed or drunk.  The web itself is a creative expression of connection, a place to gather information and sustenance."

But some variation.  It rained, it was cold, the commute to work was different, what we ate, who we encountered changes, and now the story changes- like Run Lola Run. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_Lola_Run\nManni, a bagman responsible for delivering 100,000 Deutschmarks, frantically calls his girlfriend Lola. Over the phone, Manni explains that he was riding the subway to drop off the money and fled upon seeing ticket inspectors, before realizing that he had left the money bag behind; he saw a homeless man examining it as the train pulled away. Manni's boss Ronnie will kill him in 20 minutes unless he has the money, so he is preparing to rob a nearby supermarket to replace the funds. Lola implores Manni to wait for her and decides to ask her father, a bank manager, for help.\nLola hangs up and runs down the staircase of her apartment building past a man with a dog. At the bank, her father is having a conversation with his mistress, who discloses her pregnancy. When Lola arrives, her conversation with her father turns into an argument. He tells her that he is leaving her mother and that Lola is not his biological daughter. Lola runs to meet Manni but arrives too late and sees him entering the supermarket with a gun. She helps him rob it of 100,000 marks, but on leaving, they find it surrounded by police. Surrendering, Manni throws the money bag into the air, which startles a police officer who accidentally shoots Lola dead.\nEvents restart from the moment Lola leaves the house. This time, she trips over the man with the dog and now runs with a limp, so she subsequently arrives late to the bank, allowing her father's mistress to add that he is not the father of her unborn child. A furious Lola overhears the conversation, grabs a security guard's gun, holds her father hostage, and robs the bank of 100,000 marks.

Over the phone, Manni explains that he was riding the subway to drop off the money and fled upon seeing ticket inspectors, before realizing that he had left the money bag behind; he saw a homeless man examining it as the train pulled away. Manni's boss Ronnie will kill him in 20 minutes unless he has the money, so he is preparing to rob a nearby supermarket to replace the funds. Lola implores Manni to wait for her and decides to ask her father, a bank manager, for help.\nLola hangs up and runs down the staircase of her apartment building past a man with a dog. At the bank, her father is having a conversation with his mistress, who discloses her pregnancy. When Lola arrives, her conversation with her father turns into an argument. He tells her that he is leaving her mother and that Lola is not his biological daughter. Lola runs to meet Manni but arrives too late and sees him entering the supermarket with a gun. She helps him rob it of 100,000 marks, but on leaving, they find it surrounded by police. Surrendering, Manni throws the money bag into the air, which startles a police officer who accidentally shoots Lola dead.\nEvents restart from the moment Lola leaves the house. This time, she trips over the man with the dog and now runs with a limp, so she subsequently arrives late to the bank, allowing her father's mistress to add that he is not the father of her unborn child. A furious Lola overhears the conversation, grabs a security guard's gun, holds her father hostage, and robs the bank of 100,000 marks.

Also protects us- we have ideas, experiences stored in many places, not a singular place.  The more we recall the story, the more we can readily recall it.  The more ways it is imprinted, the more we can retrieve it- for example, singing a song while skipping rope engages more of our body and brain.  If we repeat that, each time, we are having a new experience while recalling the prior experiences.  They become overlapped, creating yet something else.  If we had precisely the same experience- working in a factory, ground hogs day, The stories and experiences would potentially keep mapping to precisely the same elements of the brain.  But some variation.  It rained, it was cold, the commute to work was different, what we ate, who we encountered changes, and now the story changes- like Run Lola Run. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_Lola_Run\n"

Decisions we are asked to make tend to be simplistic, unrelated to our survival, but only if we are open to understanding that the choice to sit in front of a screen all day is not good for our long-term survival.  We are considerably more sedentary, compared to our ancestors who were on the move to sustain their very being.  We live the majority of our lives indoors, although our brains and bodies are sustained by access to light, sounds, air.\n"

The more ways it is imprinted, the more we can retrieve it- for example, singing a song while skipping rope engages more of our body and brain.
