According to Luhmann, power is a social technology that is only used when a situation offers more than one possibility for action. Due to this possibility of choice, the principle of double contingency comes into play, which has a specific coordination problem as its object. For, assuming for simplicity only two persons, Alter and Ego, the question arises: How does Ego succeed in inducing Alter to act in a certain way, when Alter could just as well act differently? Such a situation requires power so that Ego's intention becomes Alter's binding decision and action specification. Luhmann calls this kind of technology, through which the action specification of one person (co-)conditions the behavior of another, symbolically generalized communication medium."

The prerequisite is a certain scope of variation in possibilities of action, so that it is possible to react with rejection to certain specifications of action in favor of alternatives. If such alternatives do not exist, there is no need for power because rejection is highly unlikely. In this respect, the formation of the medium of power only occurs when, within a society, possibilities of rejecting prescriptions for action become apparent due to the increase in possibilities of also being able to act differently (M; Luhmann 2012). \"A need for power develops only when actions are communicated as decisions, that is, as selections that could also turn out differently; and when they refer to actions of another to which the same applies\" (PolG, 59)."

For this reason, power is essentially threatening power: alter and ego each exchange arguments as to why it is advisable or not to adopt a course of action, and depending on who puts forward the better arguments, which by no means merely claim reasonableness for themselves, one wins this power game. The motives for giving in and giving in (*Nachgeben und Einlenken*) are often negative sanctions, which are threatened but are not used if possible. Luhmann therefore also speaks of the zero methodology of power, since the possibilities of punishment in the case of rejection of the action requirement, ultimately the use of force, are brought into play, but without this move actually being carried out."
