      "text": "Researchers at cybersecurity company Rapid7 found vulnerabilities that can be used to remotely disarm the Fortress S03 smart home-security system. The Wi-Fi-based system allows owners to monitor their homes with a mobile application via Internet-linked cameras, motion sensors, and sirens, and to arm or disarm it with a radio-controlled key fob. The researchers said hackers can remotely query an unauthenticated application programming interface without the server checking the request&apos;s legitimacy; the server would return the device&apos;s unique International Mobile Equipment Identity number, which could be used to disarm the system. In addition, intercepting unencrypted radio signals between the S03 and the key fob could permit the &quot;arm&quot; and &quot;disarm&quot; signals to be captured and replayed. Rapid7 informed Fortress of the flaws, then publicly disclosed them when the company did not respond after three months; a law firm representing Fortress called the claims of vulnerabilities in the S03 system &quot;false, purposely misleading, and defamatory,&quot; without specifying why they are false, or that Fortress has fixed the vulnerabilities.
