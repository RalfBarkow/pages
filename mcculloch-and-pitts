        "text": "The definition of what we call a neuron is this. One should perhaps call it a formal neuron, because it certainly is not the real thing, though it has a number of the essential traits of the real thing. A neuron will be symbolically designated by a circle, which symbolizes the body of the neuron, and a line branching out from the circle, which symbolizes the axon of the neuron. An arrow is used to indicate that the axon of one neuron is incident on the body of another. **A neuron has two states: it's excited or not.** As to what excitation is, one need not tell. Its main characteristic is its operational characteristic and that has a certain circularity about it: its main [[Trait]] is that it can excite other neurons. Somewhere at the end of an involved network of neurons the excited neuron excites something which is not a neuron. For instance, it excites a muscle, which then produces physical motion; or it excites a gland which can produce a secretion, in which case you get a chemical change. So, the ultimate output of the excited state really produces phenomena which fall outside our present treatment. These phenomena will, for the sake of the present discussion, be entirely disregarded.\n"
