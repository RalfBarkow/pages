      "text": "The first black boxes were the cameras, later came the computers, and finally it is the whole world that is becoming similar to an apparatus that is programmed by people, but whose functioning no one wants to understand or can understand anymore. What is of interest is no longer the illumination of a problem, but the solution that eliminates this problem from the world. In Flusser's evolutionary model, a new way of thinking, a new code, is always created out of a crisis. The danger lies in eventually seeing the world only as a function of the program, that is, as a function of the black box. The program becomes the fetish around which the world articulates itself."
