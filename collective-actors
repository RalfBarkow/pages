Under the double presupposition that, first, this chain of communications communicates about itself, that is, establishes a self-description, and, second, that it is precisely to this self-description that communicative events are attributed as actions, the social reality of a collective actor emerges.

No longer is the question: what kind of ontological properties (mind, soul, reflexive capacities, empathy) must an entity possess in order to be an actor? Instead, two things are now crucial: first, it is the surrounding social system, i.e., a closed and autonomous ensemble of recursive communications, that encounters an entity under certain conditions and constructs it as the semantic artifact of an actor. On the other hand, it is also the surrounding social system – and not merely the entity itself – that constitutes its identity, as well as its ability to act and communicate, further ascribing responsibilities and rights and duties. In other words, actors do not exist per se, but social systems construct their actors by ascribing subjectivity to semantic artifacts – persons. Individual as well as collective actors are produced in the first place by way of social ascription. But paradoxical as it sounds, hard social realities are created with such fictions. To put it technically: the social reality of collective actors is based on the socially binding self-description of an organized social system as a cyclical linking of identity and attribution of action."

      "text": "An ethno-territorial unit does not become a state as the collective actor of politics because it has certain natural characteristics or a specific organizational shape. Rather, the international system constitutes its actors and forces ethno-territorial units to take the form of an institutionalized state if they are to participate in international politics. As a minimal requirement of participation, the international political system demands an organizationally anchored capacity for collective communication. In a comparable way, the market constructs corporations as collectives; otherwise, they would indeed be nothing but bundles of individual contractual relationships. Something similar is true in law. Nomen ossibus inhaeret: Once the legal system has overcome the old prejudice and endowed \"mental substances\" with nomina by granting them the capacity to act and to have rights, it can access completely new conflict dynamics, with the help of which it can enormously increase its norm production. Inventing the enigmatic legal person was the great cultural contribution of law to the organizational revolution of the modern era, which immensely expanded attributions of action beyond the realm of natural personhood. The social substrate of the legal person, which has always been a subject of much controversy, can be adequately identified only when one acknowledges the bold notion that law ascribes legal personhood not only to individual human beings but also, under certain conditions, to mere streams of information."
