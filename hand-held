Otherwise you have to pay for 2 subscriptions - one for phone, one for pda. You can also share the connection with your regular laptop if you need a bigger screen than a [[Hand Held]]. Like a Russian Doll set. Using only one device is difficult, as often you want to see the screen and can't while you are holding it to your ear. Plus the current PDA phones are too bulky. Earphones help, but there is a certain familiarity and convenience to just holding a phone to your ear. Earphones are best for driving, also; these should be [[Blue Tooth]], because ones with wires get tangled. The ideal model would have both keyboard and stylus (I like Sony's new UX50), so while you are driving you can use it with one hand, but operate like \"pen and paper\" at other times. It should have SDIO\ncard slots and GPS, and [[Wi Fi]] as well as [[Blue Tooth]] so you can use it at home or the office at higher speeds and without paying for airtime. Also at hotspots. Many new products have most of these features but not all in one package yet; for instance, the UX50 only has memory stick, no SDIO (if it did, you could add GPS, which it is also missing).",

Otherwise you have to pay for 2 subscriptions - one for phone, one for pda. You can also share the connection with your regular laptop if you need a bigger screen than a [[Hand Held]]. Like a Russian Doll set. Using only one device is difficult, as often you want to see the screen and can't while you are holding it to your ear. Plus the current PDA phones are too bulky. Earphones help, but there is a certain familiarity and convenience to just holding a phone to your ear. Earphones are best for driving, also; these should be [[Blue Tooth]], because ones with wires get tangled. The ideal model would have both keyboard and stylus (I like Sony's new UX50), so while you are driving you can use it with one hand, but operate like \"pen and paper\" at other times. It should have SDIO\ncard slots and GPS, and [[Wi Fi]] as well as [[Blue Tooth]] so you can use it at home or the office at higher speeds and without paying for airtime. Also at hotspots. Many new products have most of these features but not all in one package yet; for instance, the UX50 only has memory stick, no SDIO (if it did, you could add GPS, which it is also missing).",
