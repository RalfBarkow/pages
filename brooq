White collar jobs, tourist photography, diversity training, international art, global capital, the information superhighway, toned as a racehorse, real tears, when, during a monologue, Andrea Fraser stumbles upon the women's movement. When the artist steps into the elevator with Goodman's staff and a few stragglers, she leans up against the stainless steel panels and swoons: \"It felt like a reunion.\" "

[[White People in West Africa (1989/1991/1993)]] can't really wrestle with a \"viewer\", but instead suggests a device that is larger, or disoriented, to the camera, the browser, or even Documenta. Anything Fraser's tech is cutting edge; the rest of it looks like it could be installed at at any given graduate department in the united states."

The following conversation takes place after the first day of  the VIP previews at NAFTA: Contemporary. KIM is the intern. THE ART HANDLER is down $213,000 in student loans. The booth costs just shy of USD 10,000 and a full page bleed in art forum costs USD 5,000.\n\nThe ARTWORK is Richard Prince, Brooke Shields (Spiritual America), 1983, color photograph, 24 x 20\". The ARTWORK is well-known amongst die-hards of international contemporary art: The infamous picture was a photograph of a photograph of a heavily lubricated, extravagantly made-up, prepubescent Brooke Shields, posed to look like she has just arisen from a steamy bath. An “extremely complicated photo,” Prince has said, “of a naked girl who looks like a boy made up to look like a woman.” The ARTWORK was last realised at USD 3,973,000 out of a 4,500,000 estimate. \n"
