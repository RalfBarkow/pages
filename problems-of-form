The World Wide Web rewards the searcher with a web page devoted to a kind of Spencer-Brown cult. Intrigued, I consulted the original reviews in academic journals. The philosopher L. L. Whyte, writing in The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science proclaimed the book \"a work of genius\" while also admitting that he was not capable of passing judgment on its formal algebraic contents. In The Journal of Symbolic Logic, the reviewer did manage to penetrate the formalism, noting a variety of invalid inferences in it as well as missing axioms required to carry through the valid deductions. It came as no surprise, then, to learn that Spencer-Brown's calculus has played no role in later treatments of the foundations of mathematics and logic, whatever significance it may yet have for the formalization of Luhmann's theory."

A cult can have good reason to admire a neglected figure. Serious scholars, such as those contributing to Problems of Form, can ignore obscure elements and concentrate on conceptual insights. And yet, the combination of dense prose that conveys Luhmann's complex theory and a formal calculus with dubious internal validity do not sound like a good bet for a future breakthrough in mathematical social theory."

A cult can have good reason to admire a neglected figure. Serious scholars, such as those contributing to Problems of Form, can ignore obscure elements and concentrate on conceptual insights. And yet, the combination of dense prose that conveys Luhmann's complex theory and a formal calculus with dubious internal validity do not sound like a good bet for a future breakthrough in mathematical social theory."
