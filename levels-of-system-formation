This is not just a specific, competing version of social theory. If one starts from a theory of social systems, one analyzes from a conceptual level that is more aggregated than the theory of society. Sociology is then no longer just social theory (or, as in the Eastern Bloc, an empirical auxiliary science of social theory). For them, the theory of the comprehensive system of social reality is only a partial theory. In other words, sociology needs a different, more abstract level of meaning to integrate its findings than society needs to integrate itself."
