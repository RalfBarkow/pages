Investment and credit can be important to many commons, especially those requiring infrastructures and interactions with markets.  However, given the known dangers of extraction, exploitation and social disruption associated with capitalist banking and finance, capital and credit within commons must be deployed with strict systems of accountability and mutualized benefit. Attention must also be paid to maintaining the integrity of community relationships amidst the socially distorting influences of money-flows."

The idea, as outlined in rigorous detail by British monetary expert Mary Mellor, argues that the state can create money for all sorts of ecological and social purposes -- \"quantitative easing for people\" -- without it being counted as public (government) debt. This is precisely what occurred during the 2008-9 financial crisis except that the new money creation was used to bailout insolvent banks.  Mellor proposes new ways to manage money-creation so that the benefits of money-flows can accrue to taxpayers and commoners.  "

Investment and credit can be important to many commons, especially those requiring infrastructures and interactions with markets.  However, given the known dangers of extraction, exploitation and social disruption associated with capitalist banking and finance, capital and credit within commons must be deployed with strict systems of accountability and mutualized benefit. Attention must also be paid to maintaining the integrity of community relationships amidst the socially distorting influences of money-flows."
