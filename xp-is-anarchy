Absolutely not, because you can plan only 2 weeks ahead, everything that was not done in an iteration is thrown and must be scheduled *again* from the start for the next iteration. The PM would be exhausted and he would have very little to show, except of course working software that can be validated by the user, but wait, it must be compiled, it must be integrated and you have to keep track on what builds you found the errors. How is going to know how to build, how to install or how to use the software the customer? If they find an error, how are they going to report it? In cards? They are new requirements? How can you keep track of those? Do you have to wait for the next iteration for developers to fix those errors? Is that a joke? If a programmer says he fixed it, how can I verify it?",
