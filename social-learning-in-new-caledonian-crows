      "text": "Social transmission within a population may generally be either vertical (from parent to offspring) or horizontal (between unrelated individuals) (Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman, 1981; but see Allison, 1992; Boyd & Richerson, 1985; Findlay, Hansell, & Lumsden, 1989, for more detailed definitions). Individual improvements to techniques are unlikely to become established if there is a strong possibility of horizontal transmission (Sterelny, 2006). This is because horizontal transmission would provide a multitude of different variations to choose from, “diluting” improvements made by parents. Vertical transmission is therefore considered to be crucial to create a ratchet effect to maintain individual improvements that are not influenced by horizontal transmission (Sterelny, 2006)."
