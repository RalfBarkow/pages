If the interaction is one way, so that the controller acts on the system without obtaining any information about its state, then the controller is called ‘‘open loop.’’ In ‘‘closed-loop’’ control, by contrast, the controller acts on the basis of information that it obtains about the state of the system. A particularly important form of closed-loop control is feedback control, in which the controller obtains information about the system (i.e., the system acts on the controller via sensors), processes it, and feeds it back by acting on the system via actuators. Though more complicated than open-loop control, closed-loop control is typically more accurate as well: the acquisition of information about the system allows greater flexibility in control strategy."
