It is different from conventional statistical prediction because data miners don't care much about parsimony, so they don't care about covariance.

A data miner will happily bung them both in if together they improve its predictive power even slightly. This is because statisticians think good predictive models are ones that both predict well and hint at the underlying causalities. A data miner doesn't care about anything except good prediction (for example; what's going to be the most profitable / least risky way to spend my limited resource).

They do analysis to discover theories, which can creep scientists out (who are more comforatble with doing analysis to evaluate theories they thought of themselves, clever monkeys). The scientific fetish for parsimony (an artefact of reductionism) can lead scientists to be flumoxed by complexity. When dealing with complex patterns in data, a data miner might use algorithms that deliver complicated but useful models. However, leveraging these models can involve articulating them to people with reductionist proclivities, so it's not uncommon to \"model the model\" with something that is easy to explain - for example, make a decision tree that can be graphically presented on one side of a an envelope instead of pages of code (even if the code outperforms the tree). >> artefact reductionism"

Data mining just involves studying and republishing data that was already here. It can involve complicated techniques to extract data, since the data is not usually in very structured form. Scientists tend to want to study new theories (or existing theories) about the universe, while data miners tend to mine data that came from humans. For example, a data miner does not go around mining information from camels and elephants mouths - instead data miners tend to focus on a branch of human information statistics. Examples are mining data from streams of text, phone calls, banking transactions, internet websites, encyclopedias, books (optical character recognition ), etc. Therefore some data mining is simply a form of analysis (sometimes very statistical) on information - and is not a black magic. All statistics are not fool proof and contain estimations and possible errors - data mining is no exception. Some data mining involves republishing data, combined with statistical analysis. For example a search engine data mines and then republishes a small summary of the original data (existing copyrighted content). None of this is creepy - data mining is just humans analyzing and republishing data that was already there, in a different form.</i> ",

Data miners are essentially in the business of statistics-based compression of data into 'theories' (i.e. from the dataset, P has a 95% chance of predicting Q).  They tend to verify such theories by splitting data-sets randomly - e.g. half for production of rules, half for testing of rules.  These 'theories' are, themselves, the products of a data mining exercise.  Scientists often take a similar approach (e.g. viewing a graph of data before constructing a hypothesis), so the above author's characterization on that aspect is a bit unfair - but, still, that scientists favor parsimony is correct ([[Occams Razor]]) - they attempt to invent a simple theory via an intermediate <i>model</i> based on existing observations, then test it against future observations.  A scientist's model will tend to be well factored, e.g. drop observations into a model, and out pops a predicted value.  Relatively, the 'theories' that come out of a data mining exercise can be complicated or poorly factored... e.g. supposing data matches (precisely) a simple 'model' <b>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</b> that a scientist or statistician or even a kid with a trigonometry background would discover immediately.  Many techniques for automated mining of data will be far from perfect and will result, from this data, in many if not dozens of formulas dealing with various ranges of a and b to predict various ranges of c.  And teaching a neural network via this data will be complex 'black magic' from a scientist's perspective - you can't get useful theory back out of a neural network.  The advantage of [[Data Mining]] is that these very same tools and techniques can make useful predictions even where scientists are <i>unable</i> to provide useful theories or models - i.e. the job gets done even if a scientist will find the solution ugly, hackish, and abhorrent under [[Occams Razor]].

It is different from conventional statistical prediction because data miners don't care much about parsimony, so they don't care about covariance. Where two or more variables have similar predictive qualities (i.e. contain equivalent information), a statistician will endeavour to chose the better of two covariant parameters for their model. A data miner will happily bung them both in if together they improve its predictive power even slightly. This is because statisticians think good predictive models are ones that both predict well and hint at the underlying causalities. A data miner doesn't care about anything except good prediction (for example; what's going to be the most profitable / least risky way to spend my limited resource). That's why data miners are happy with complicated but effective neural nets, but they can creep statisticians out.

Data mining just involves studying and republishing data that was already here. It can involve complicated techniques to extract data, since the data is not usually in very structured form. Scientists tend to want to study new theories (or existing theories) about the universe, while data miners tend to mine data that came from humans. For example, a data miner does not go around mining information from camels and elephants mouths - instead data miners tend to focus on a branch of human information statistics. Examples are mining data from streams of text, phone calls, banking transactions, internet websites, encyclopedias, books (optical character recognition ), etc. Therefore some data mining is simply a form of analysis (sometimes very statistical) on information - and is not a black magic. All statistics are not fool proof and contain estimations and possible errors - data mining is no exception. Some data mining involves republishing data, combined with statistical analysis. For example a search engine data mines and then republishes a small summary of the original data (existing copyrighted content). None of this is creepy - data mining is just humans analyzing and republishing data that was already there, in a different form.</i> ",

Data miners are essentially in the business of statistics-based compression of data into 'theories' (i.e. from the dataset, P has a 95% chance of predicting Q).  They tend to verify such theories by splitting data-sets randomly - e.g. half for production of rules, half for testing of rules.  These 'theories' are, themselves, the products of a data mining exercise.  Scientists often take a similar approach (e.g. viewing a graph of data before constructing a hypothesis), so the above author's characterization on that aspect is a bit unfair - but, still, that scientists favor parsimony is correct ([[Occams Razor]]) - they attempt to invent a simple theory via an intermediate <i>model</i> based on existing observations, then test it against future observations.  A scientist's model will tend to be well factored, e.g. drop observations into a model, and out pops a predicted value.  Relatively, the 'theories' that come out of a data mining exercise can be complicated or poorly factored... e.g. supposing data matches (precisely) a simple 'model' <b>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</b> that a scientist or statistician or even a kid with a trigonometry background would discover immediately.  Many techniques for automated mining of data will be far from perfect and will result, from this data, in many if not dozens of formulas dealing with various ranges of a and b to predict various ranges of c.  And teaching a neural network via this data will be complex 'black magic' from a scientist's perspective - you can't get useful theory back out of a neural network.  The advantage of [[Data Mining]] is that these very same tools and techniques can make useful predictions even where scientists are <i>unable</i> to provide useful theories or models - i.e. the job gets done even if a scientist will find the solution ugly, hackish, and abhorrent under [[Occams Razor]].
