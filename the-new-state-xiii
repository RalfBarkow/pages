So far as the quality\nof originality can be described, do we not mean that his capacity\nfor saturation is greater, his connection with the psychic\nreservoir more direct, so that some group finds in him its most\ncomplete interpreter?  Or even if it is quite evident that in a\nparticular instance a particular individual has not derived his\nidea from the group of which he is at the moment a member, but has\nbrought it to the group, none of us believes that that idea arose\nspontaneously in his mind independent of all previous association. \nThis individual has belonged to many other groups, has discussed\nwith many men, or even if he has lived his life apart he has read\nnewspapers and magazines, books and letters, and has mingled his\nideas with those he has found there.  Thus the \"individual\" idea he\nbrings to a group is not really an \"individual\" idea; it is the\nresult of the process of interpenetration, but by bringing it to a\nnew group and soaking it in that the interpenetration becomes more\ncomplex.  The group idea he takes away is now his individual idea\nso far as any new group is concerned, and in fact it becomes an\nactive agent in his progress and the progress of society only by\nmeeting a new group.  Our life is more and more stagnant in\nproportion as we refuse the group life.",
