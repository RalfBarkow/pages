Mathematics is shifting to visual rather than textual forms of expression. Venn diagrams, Feynman diagrams, diagrammatic reasoning, cellular automata, fractals, knot theory, string theory, category theory, silicon circuit design; each of these fields relies upon the iconic representation of formal systems. Like geometry these fields can be seen as addressing inherently multidimensional concepts. Formalism is escaping its symbolic constraints.\n"
