      "text": "Industry leaders warned in an open letter from the nonprofit Center for AI Safety that artificial intelligence (AI) technology might threaten humanity's existence. Signatories included more than 350 executives, scientists, and engineers working on AI, with the CEOs of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic among them. ACM Turing Award recipients and AI pioneers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio also signed the letter, which comes amid growing concern about the potential hazards of AI partly fueled by innovations in large language models. Such advancements have provoked fears of AI facilitating mass job takeovers and the spread of misinformation, while earlier this month OpenAI's Sam Altman said the risks were sufficiently dire to warrant government intervention and regulation."
