The classical definition of observability must be somewhat altered for quantum systems since the irreversible disturbance introduced by measurement implies that no procedure can reveal an arbitrary unknown initial state of a quantum system. Accordingly, a quantum system will be called observable by a coherent controller by classical feedback if the proper sequence of controls and measurements can be used to observe any desired feature of the initial state of the system. Specifically, the system is observable if the controller can make a measurement that reveals the projection of the original state along any desired set of orthogonal axes in Hilbert space.
