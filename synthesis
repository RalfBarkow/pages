It is also concerned with the functional interaction of the parts of a system. This orientation derives from the preoccupation of systems thinking with the design and redesign of systems. In systems design, parts identified by analysis of the function(s) to be performed by the whole are not put together like unchangeable pieces of a jigsaw puzzle; they are designed to fit each other so as to work together harmoniously as well as efficiently and effectively."

Development of this complementarity is a major task of systems thinking. Analysis focuses on structure,; it reveals how things work. Synthesis focuses on function; it reveals why things operate as they do. Therefore, analysis yields knowledge; synthesis yields understanding. The former enables us to describe; the later, to explain.\n"

        "text": "Analysis looks into things; synthesis looks out of things. Machine-Age thinking was concerned only with the interactions of the parts of the thing to be explained; systems thinking is similarly concerned, but it is additionally occupied with the interactions of that thing with other things in its environment and with its environment itself. It is also concerned with the functional interaction of the parts of a system. This orientation derives from the preoccupation of systems thinking with the design and redesign of systems. In systems design, parts identified by analysis of the function(s) to be performed by the whole are not put together like unchangeable pieces of a jigsaw puzzle; they are designed to fit each other so as to work together harmoniously as well as efficiently and effectively."

This concern with harmnony has important implications in the management of systems […]."
