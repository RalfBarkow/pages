At the same time, however, it is ruining the climate and the environment, so that humanity's very existence is now at risk. \"Green growth\" is supposed to be the salvation, but economic expert and bestselling author Ulrike Herrmann holds against it: In her new book, she explains in an understandable and razor-sharp way why we need \"green shrinkage\" instead. The climate crisis is worsening daily, but in concrete terms almost nothing is changing. Greenhouse gases are increasing unchecked and dramatically. This failure is no accident, because the climate crisis aims at the heart of capitalism. Prosperity and growth are only possible by using technology and burning energy. Unfortunately, however, green energy from the sun and wind will never be enough to fuel global growth. So the industrialized countries must say goodbye to capitalism and strive for a circular economy in which only what can be recycled is consumed. But how to envision this green shrinkage? The best model is, of all things, the British wartime economy from 1940 onward. \"Herrmann's book is historically instructive and a good read. It points out where technological limitations to climate change lie. Yet it comes across as deterministic. Herrmann acknowledges that humans have solved many problems in the past. But she apparently doubts that this time it will be the same\" (deutschlandfunk.de). Ranked 9th on the nonfiction bestseller list for November 2022.

A reduction in prejudices naturally corresponds to complicated learning processes that are also difficult to master personally, because restructuring behavioral patterns once they have become entrenched is always more difficult than practicing new patterns. Third, the discussions about whether this path should be taken at all and how quickly, as well as the successes and failures, had an intensifying effect on the internal party disputes.\n"

DOI 10.1093/applin/11.2.113. \n> This paper argues for a cognitive psychological approach to second language phenomena that emphasizes the importance of the development of automaticity and the process of restructuring. It is argued that practice can lead improvement in performance as sub-skills become automated, but it is also possible for increased practice to create conditions for restructuring, with attendant decrements in performance as learners reorganize their internal representational framework. In the second case, performance may follow a U-shaped curve, declining as more complex internal representations replace less complex ones, and increasing again as skill becomes expertise. Examples are drawn from first and second language research, and from research on expert systems. The cognitive approach is not seen as competitive to, but as complementary with, linguistic approaches to second language development.\n"

If I'm going to sit down for example, I've got to think of myself and almost see myself sitting down before I do it. It's the same with other things like washing, eating, and even dressing – things that I have done at one time without even bothering or thinking about at all... I take more time to do things because I am always conscious of what I am doing. If I could just stop noticing what I am doing ... I have to do everything step by step now, nothing is automatic.

Phase 1 is the stage of automaticity and is data-driven; components of the task are mastered, but there is no attempt at overall organization. Organization is imposed at phase 2, when behavior is dominated by 'organization-oriented procedures', which result from the learner's attempts to simplify, unify, and gain control over the internal representation. Phase 3 involves the integration of the data-driven, bottom-up processes that guide phase 1 and the internally-generated, top-down processes that guide phase 2. This integration results from the restructuring at work in phase 2, which, once consolidated, can take environmental [[Feedback]] into account without jeopardizing the overall organization."

Operations always run blind and, at the level of operations, the system has no control over its own processes. The code does not provide instructions for action; it provides only the orientation for operations, securing the connection to following operations. Self-regulation and self-control of the system happen at the level of programs, which guide the observation of the operations by the system itself (based on other distinctions than the ones orienting those operations). Programs determine the conditions necessary for the realizability of a certain operation. They determine, for instance, that attributing the positive value of the code is only correct under particular conditions. Hence the programs of the legal system (laws and procedures) determine which of the parties can be correctly claimed to be right and which to be wrong, and what must be taken into account in this decision. The programs of science (theories and methods) determine which conditions must be fulfilled in order to be able to claim that something is true. For instance, the programs of the education system determine the criteria for the selection of the pupils.\n"

If I'm going to sit down for example, I've got to think of myself and almost see myself sitting down before I do it. It's the same with other things like washing, eating, and even dressing – things that I have done at one time without even bothering or thinking about at all... I take more time to do things because I am always conscious of what I am doing. If I could just stop noticing what I am doing ... I have to do everything step by step now, nothing is automatic. Everything has to be considered. (McGhie 1969)"

Phase 1 is the stage of automaticity and is data-driven; components of the task are mastered, but there is no attempt at overall organization. Organization is imposed at phase 2, when behavior is dominated by 'organization-oriented procedures', which result from the learner's attempts to simplify, unify, and gain control over the internal representation. Phase 3 involves the integration of the data-driven, bottom-up processes that guide phase 1 and the internally-generated, top-down processes that guide phase 2. This integration results from the restructuring at work in phase 2, which, once consolidated, can take environmental feedback into account without jeopardizing the overall organization."
