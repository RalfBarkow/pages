This operator, being Hermitian, is excellent for obtaining the numerical equivalent to the supersonic quantities, since all eigenvalues are real and the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the distribution of normal velocity on the vibrating surface. As it will be discussed in Section 2.3, the fact of not being necessary to construct an hologram to compute the acoustic pressure, make this technique more straightforward."

To obtain such operator, the authors used the BEM. It is worth nothing that Xu and Huang’s work is restricted to find the acoustical power from the normal velocity field on the source surface, including radiant and non-radiant components. Having as starting point the work of these authors, it is presented in what follows the mathematical formulation necessary to obtain the sound power operator, and, in the sequel, the numerical equivalent to the acoustical intensity [6]."
