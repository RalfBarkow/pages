LLNL's Maxwell Murialdo and Jon Belof said the energy-information link supports the generation of a cryptocurrency token directly backed by and convertible into one kilowatt-hour of electricity, making E-Stablecoin the first digital token to be collateralized by a physical asset.  Said Belof, &quot;Through thermodynamic reversibility&#8212;to the extent that it is allowed by a modern understanding of statistical mechanics&#8212;we envision a future blockchain that is not only rooted in real-life assets like energy usage, but also is a more responsible steward of our natural resources in support of the economy.&quot;"
