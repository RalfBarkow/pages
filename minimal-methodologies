The loss of productivity in large projects is due to an ever increasing communications overload and this is at least partly due to two factors: 1) complexity and 2) bad partitioning. Complexity is unavoidable ... it WILL cause you to expend more time more inefficiently. Bad partitioning, which is usually, but not always, partitioning along lines with high coupling instead of low or weak coupling increase bug-incidence and and communications overhead both oral, managerial (meetings and what not) and written - especially construction and inspection and approval of interface documents. -- Ray Schneider",
