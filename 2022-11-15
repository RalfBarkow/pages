      "text": "Interest in tiny houses on wheels has grown steadily in recent years: many people would like to move into a tiny house permanently or at least temporarily - but their plans often fail because of official permits. Out of this unsatisfactory situation, Ingo Benz developed the idea of building Tiny Houses as vacation homes for farms and wineries. \"The approval process for farmers is usually many times easier than for private users,\" Ingo Benz knows. So instead of developing apartments in the farmhouse, farmers could offer one ödere several Tiny houses for vacationers on suitable land. These enjoy a relaxed vacation on the farm or on the vineyard: in a separate little domicile that lacks nothing.\nIn the meantime, Ingo Benz has extensively developed and perfected his ideas. Interested parties can view a veritable showpiece of Tiny-House at the company's headquarters in Kandern. While the exhibition house was built on a hanger measuring 6.00 x 2.50 meters, the Benz company can now realize Tinys in a maximum format of 10.20 x 3.00 meters. In this case, users have a floor area of about 30 square meters plus second floor as a living-sleeping area, thus approaching 40 square meters of living space.\nHigh-quality, well thought-out fittings\nConventional Tiny Houses, which are attached to the car, are subject to a maximum permissible total weight of 3.5 tons in this country. \"We cannot comply with this weight, including furniture, for our houses, which were built completely ecologically in solid wood and without lightweight materials or plastic,\" explains Benz. But a solution has been found for this as well: A German trailer manufacturer has developed a system in which the houses are declared as cargo. This allows for a width of up to three meters and a permissible total weight of six tons. These trailers are air-braked and require an appropriate tractor or truck as the towing vehicle. However, this means that there are hardly any limits to all equipment variants.\nAnother special feature of the small houses from the Benz joinery is the equally high-quality as well thought-out equipment, which can be flexibly designed according to the wishes and budget specifications of the client. \"Here, of course, our core competence, the manufacturing of kitchens and furniture from solid wood, comes into play,\" explains Ingo Benz. Thus, nothing is missing in the Tiny House exhibition in Kandern: from the kitchen, including kitchen appliances, to the electrical connections.\n "

More recently they are specifically literary white men, for whom climate change is the ultimate epic saga, in which all of humanity is both villain and hero. “[[We]]” had a chance to act on climate decades ago and blew it, the story goes, and now “we” must rise to the challenge and save humanity. If we don’t – and we’re unlikely to – ”we” will have only ourselves to blame."

When other countries said no thanks to contaminating their water sources for the sake of natural gas, U.S. companies said no worries, we’ll frack here and export it. That’s one reason the U.S. became the world’s number-one energy supplier and why, at a time when scientists are saying we need to have started on a path toward zero emissions yesterday, global emissions are climbing."

When the name of Frank Press, which should have been in headlines worldwide, would remain unknown for decades; during all the years when even the farthest left-leaning politicians and the Sierra Club were telling us that “clean-burning” natural gas could be a bridge fuel toward green energy? (For what it’s worth, natural gas does emit less CO2 when burned; unfortunately the drilling and transportation of it emits methane, a greenhouse gas 30 times more damaging than CO2.)"

When other countries said no thanks to contaminating their water sources for the sake of natural gas, U.S. companies said no worries, we’ll frack here and export it. That’s one reason the U.S. became the world’s number-one energy supplier and why, at a time when scientists are saying we need to have started on a path toward zero emissions yesterday, global emissions are climbing."
