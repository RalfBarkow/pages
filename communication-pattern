Administrative thinking on this point commonly rests upon the assumption that optimum patterns of communications for a task-group may be derived from the specifications of the task to be performed. Students of organization, however, have pointed out repeatedly that working groups – even if one considers only communications relevant to the work being done – invariably tend to depart from formal statements of the pattern to be employed."

A group that exists as part of a larger organization, however, may have relatively little freedom to make such an adjustment. In [[Military]] organizations, for example, the maintenance of the stated, presumably optimum, patterns of communication is regarded as a first principle of effective performance. It is easy to understand this tendency to inhibit change in formal communication patterns if one considers how intimate the relation is among communication, control, and authority. >> military"

      "text": "In such restrictive organizations the imposed patterns determine certain aspects of the group process; the group process does not completely determine the communication pattern. This situation raises questions about how a fixed communication pattern may affect the work and life of a group. Do some patterns have structural properties that limit group performance? It may be that among several communication patterns, all logically adequate for the successful completion of a specified task, one gives significantly better performance than another. What effects can pattern, as such,have upon the emergence of leadership, the development of organization, the degree of resistance to group disruption, the ability to adapt successfully to sudden changes in the working environment?"

Administrative thinking on this point commonly rests upon the assumption that optimum patterns of communications for a task-group may be derived from the specifications of the task to be performed. Students of organization, however, have pointed out repeatedly that working groups – even if one considers only communications relevant to the work being done – invariably tend to depart from formal statements of the pattern to be employed."
