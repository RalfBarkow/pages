Once you have a few basic parts in hand, then entities of the behavioral portion of the problem domain, we don't really think about the data yet, that comes later. We have all the elements to build the program and solve any problem at hand, we can use the same elements to solve any number of different problems without having to create new elements. We can fluff out the data later as the need dictates. As behavior is added piece by piece, we add any data required to support that behavior. OO programs have an organization at the object level (not classes) that procedural programs can't. Procedual programs have procedures, OO programs have context sensitive procedures, the same procedure name may have 15 different contexts that it can work in, thus we can simplify our solution language. We could do the same with procedural by having one large procedure that has all 15 contexts in a big switch statement. While this makes adding new procedures easier, it makes adding new contexts to groups of methods damn near impossible. The OO solution allows adding entire new contexts a breeze, and we seem to find that more important and more useful.

Take lisp generic functions for example, very powerful, very flexible, and still, unless you know and memorize all the available functions, you're not likely to know Owns even exists. They are indispensable when you really need multiple dispatch, but in most scenarios... single dispatch is all that's needed and the messaging object.method(arg) is simply easer to reason about because I have something to look at. I can see what messages the object responds too. Generic functions don't allow that, they make me remember it all. So, in most cases, single dispatch message oriented programming is easier, when it isn't, go for the generic function. I never claimed polymorphism was tied to abstract data types, just that they are easier to work with when tied together for most cases. Simply put... the object provides much needed scope to the list of available messages. If the Owns message only works with people and company, then it should be on either person or company, not living on it's own in a module.

Once you have a few basic parts in hand, then entities of the behavioral portion of the problem domain, we don't really think about the data yet, that comes later. We have all the elements to build the program and solve any problem at hand, we can use the same elements to solve any number of different problems without having to create new elements. We can fluff out the data later as the need dictates. As behavior is added piece by piece, we add any data required to support that behavior. OO programs have an organization at the object level (not classes) that procedural programs can't. Procedual programs have procedures, OO programs have context sensitive procedures, the same procedure name may have 15 different contexts that it can work in, thus we can simplify our solution language. We could do the same with procedural by having one large procedure that has all 15 contexts in a big switch statement. While this makes adding new procedures easier, it makes adding new contexts to groups of methods damn near impossible. The OO solution allows adding entire new contexts a breeze, and we seem to find that more important and more useful. If the word \"Contains\" is a message/procedure to determine if one thing contains another, the procedural solution would have a big long Contains method that handled every possible case of input.

Take lisp generic functions for example, very powerful, very flexible, and still, unless you know and memorize all the available functions, you're not likely to know Owns even exists. They are indispensable when you really need multiple dispatch, but in most scenarios... single dispatch is all that's needed and the messaging object.method(arg) is simply easer to reason about because I have something to look at. I can see what messages the object responds too. Generic functions don't allow that, they make me remember it all. So, in most cases, single dispatch message oriented programming is easier, when it isn't, go for the generic function. I never claimed polymorphism was tied to abstract data types, just that they are easier to work with when tied together for most cases. Simply put... the object provides much needed scope to the list of available messages. If the Owns message only works with people and company, then it should be on either person or company, not living on it's own in a module.
