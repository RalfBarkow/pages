      "text": "These diagrams summarize the frequencies of interaction among the participating organizations, and their accuracy and complexity have proven beneficial in training incident commanders. \"Who is trying to manage systems like this from many units? What information channels are required?\" - Questions like these have helped workshop participants reach a new level of thinking: the social dimension of the difficulties of communication among many individual organizations. They have enabled mission leaders to realize that there is more to the problem than assuming that the solution to their problems lies in more technical tools.\nBut now to the objections. First, representations of such networks of organizations based solely on frequency of interactions can be misleading. But then the measurement of content or weight of interaction is not easy to incorporate. YAMAMOTO (1981) has recently attempted to break it down into \"report coupling\" and \"directive coupling,\" i.e., \"situation report\" and \"directive\" functions-a useful start. However, the question of content is much more complex. Second, these representations reflect our data collection strategy - a survey that focuses almost exclusively on the incident commander. They are therefore limited to the perceptual scope of these managers and may, of course, differ from that of subordinate staff, whether in the incident command or at the scene. Even the representation of a single variable (such as interaction frequency) therefore requires basic assumptions regarding a concept of \"organization.\" When units such as the police of the state in question are included in the study, the differentiation of subordinate agencies may become clearer, but still teases the analyst into asking, \"What is my definition of 'organization' anyway?\"\nVariations in response among employees of individual organizations in different 'places of operation' (in the geographic or even structural meaning), however, should by no means be regarded as measurement errors. Rather, such measurement differences represent a challenge to basic concept and assumptions that serve as our starting point (BENSON 1977). This challenge cannot be met by taking an average of the responses to obtain a 'core set of organizations'. The complexity of the social reality we are trying to understand must be problematized directly, not hidden in a footnote. Fortunately, researchers have now made progress with other types of networks, but many questions remain unanswered to date (siche ALDRICH & WHETTEN 1981).\nInconveniently, things get even more complicated: suppose for ourselves that all the problem areas presented so far have been resolved and we now want to compare our six organizational schemes of communication-what methods should we use?

Energy consumption, water and land use, greenhouse gas emissions, ocean acidification, tropical forest loss, species extinction: We would not have made the transition from a growth-oriented economic model motivated by greed, envy and the desire for dominance to a functioning sufficiency economy, that is, to a truly sustainable and decelerated form of economic activity.\nWhen it comes to the climate catastrophe, it is no longer intellectually honest to be optimistic. Mankind has been \"lying to itself\" for too long. Metzinger pleads for a new culture of consciousness, without God and without religion, for a new, secular spirituality, also by means of meditation, for an attitude of mind that links Western science with Eastern meditation practices.\nHow should this be shaped? Why do theologies, religions, faith communities have no probity and no persuasive power? And how will the new culture of consciousness be able to save humanity and the planet?\nA conversation led by [[Ahmad Milad Karimi]].\n\n"
