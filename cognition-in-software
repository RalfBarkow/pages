Second, our very visual perception is itself a cognitive process: the interpretation and understanding of the signals that we get from our eyes is cognition we cannot actually see. Most of us have an internal illusion of very visual cognition. (N.B. some people explicitly don't have mental pictures). For those of us who do have mental pictures, it doesn't work the way we imagine, literally & figuratively (& now also distracted by the \"figure\" in the concept \"figurative\"—can't even talk about this stuff in UTF-8 characters without reaching for visual metaphors built into my language)."

        "text": "[[Eric Dobbs]]: My experience from an education in architecture and then also from decades of drawing software things on whiteboards in small groups, I learned that the visualization in my head breaks down almost immediately when I try to transfer those \"images\" to paper or whiteboard. Once I have transferred the ideas from mental to actually visual I get to see how the spacial rules don't work the way I imagined. With just me and something to draw on, I can create a dialog between different internal cognitive workers [⇒ [[Ghost in the Box]]], one thinking and visualizing and imagining, and the other actually perceiving and interpreting what has landed in the drawing. There's an interesting feedback loop there. A stick and some dirt, or [[Pen]] and [[Paper]] as the original tool for thinking.\n\n"

This is even harder for humans to see, and maybe more so for humans, like [[Eric Dobbs]], raised in the United States' overwhelmingly individualized value system—this is extra relevant given the US' outsized cultural influence in software. See https://wiki.dbbs.co/[[joint-cognitive-whiteboard]].html for the place where he captured that lightbulb going off in his own head.\n\n"

That said, I definitely feel very excited about how federated wiki's architecture and these recent experiments with [[Graph Collaboration]] can maybe also help us humans to get glimpses of our cognition, our social cognition, and have better tools to think with TOGETHER.\n>\n> (wow! look at that wall of text! I'll have to move that to a wiki page. Sorry for flooding the chat with that!)
