Many of us fail to use our breathing effectively and yet it is an amazing tool. Breathing helps us connect our mind to our body. Most of us take very shallow breaths and, as a result, fail to work the muscles in our chest. Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try sucking in air through your nose using your throat. We can breathe in to different parts of our body. Breathing out emphasises letting go and relaxation.",

Pilates and swimming have taught me the power of coordinating my breathing with my movement. My breathing can make me stronger and/or more relaxed. Breathe out as you sit – as you ask for any change. Many of us fail to use our breathing effectively and yet it is an amazing tool. Breathing helps us connect our mind to our body. Most of us take very shallow breaths and, as a result, fail to work the muscles in our chest. Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try sucking in air through your nose using your throat. We can breathe in to different parts of our body. Breathing out emphasises letting go and relaxation.",
