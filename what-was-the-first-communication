We do not need to explain the question of the first communication, because the question \"What was the first communication?\" is already a question in a communicating system. The system always thinks of its beginning from the middle. If it is complex enough, it can ask the question how everything started. Then there may be different answers, which do not disturb the continuation of communication, but perhaps even inspire it. So initial questions do not interest us, or rather they interest us only as one question among many others."
