The scandalizing effect of this theory can be found from the beginning in the fact that it does not start from a 'plug-in world' in which everything that occurs is in something that still has something in it, for example people in society and in people the psyche, but from the fact that the world of meaning can be ordered along the system/environment difference. To put it in a nutshell: System theory understands education as an operation of a closed functional system and the people who are relevant for this system (here: those to be educated) as the environment or co-environment of this very system."

It is the social structure which - 'moored' at the anchor point of the proper name - directs, as it were, in which way and to what extent 'people' can be communicatively addressed. Social addresses are classically 'bundles of behavioral expectations', in our context, however, they are combination scopes by means of which it is continuously decided whether the behavior of people fits socially or not, and even whether this behavior is taken up at all for the continuation of communication (of communication!)."

It is not even communicable if and insofar as it is cogent that social systems process not consciousness but communications. What is at stake in the theory piece of social address is only whether and how the co-world (the relevant environment) gets involved in the game of sociality."

Social addresses are classically 'bundles of behavioral expectations', in our context, however, they are combination scopes by means of which it is continuously decided whether the behavior of people fits socially or not, and even whether this behavior is taken up at all for the continuation of communication (of communication!)."

In context control, management devotes its attention less to the fulfillment of a task and more to the conditions under which the task can be fulfilled. In doing so, it opens the space to the unavailable, to what it cannot do. There can be no ready-made toolkit for this with instructions for use and a guarantee of success. There are tools with which good experiences have been made in various contexts. But they cannot be used mechanically; they need a theoretical foundation, a suitable attitude and, above all, an openness to results. Those who want to introduce such new forms of leadership embark on a learning path together with others, on which it is necessary to experiment and share elements that work well. This is what we want to do here, using the leadership of committees as an example."
