They as well are, for whatever reason, not able to look at their full impacts.\nInstead, they focus on a limited set of themes and impacts, which may fuel organizational narratives implying the whole organization and its business model is sustainable.\nConcluding remarks\nAbove, we have essentially added new components or \"patterns\" to sustainable development.\nTo create an approach to sustainable development, we need to develop a vision of the future that explains what values the organization it is going to deliver to its stakeholders and society at large, and that stakeholders and affected people find acceptable. The purpose and vision behind where the organization wants to go need to be explicit.\nWhereas establishing our purpose and vision has virtually no limits to our imagination, we should be conscious of taking a 360-degrees view towards all of the organizational impacts and set minimum threshold levels that count as net positive contributions to sustainable development. Doing so will guarantee the organization's social license to operate.\nFrom a sustainable development perspective, it does not make sense to narrow down the strategic contribution of an organization to a limited set of impacts or contributions. Positive impact needs to be demonstrated in all areas of influence, be they related to social, human, environmental, governance values.\nAlso, an accurate evaluation of an organization's contribution to sustainable development is only meaningful if it addresses the impacts on the commons: stocks of ecosystems and ecosystem services, common lands and fisheries, physical space available, access to food, knowledge to be able to evaluate impacts of strategies fully and to assess the effects on future generations etcetera. The impacts on the commons are still underspecified aspects of future organizational visions. They deserve more thinking and research."
