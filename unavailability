The functioning of advertising and the capitalist commodity economy in general is based on the fact that it translates our existential need for resonance, and that is: our desire for relationship, into an object desire. We buy the commodity (the safari) and hope for a resonant experience with nature – the former can be guaranteed, the latter not, it perhaps becomes all the more unlikely the more available we strive to make it: Yes, we want to encounter the lion, guaranteed, but it is equally guaranteed not to get too close, it must not take too long (after all, we want to be back in time for dinner) and we don't want to get soaked by the rain or burnt by the sun in the process."

The other aim, however, is to patiently work out the respective lines of tension between the desire for resonance and the demand for availability and to gain ideas on how this contradiction might one day be overcome or resolved."

To trace this basic contradiction in all its manifold manifestations and with all its social and psychological consequences, even in places where we would not expect it in our everyday actions and in the social fields of conflict in society, is one objective that I would now like to pursue in the second part of this book in the hope that it will shed some illuminating light on the difficulties in which this modernity finds itself in its relationship to nature as well as in its political and subjective relationship to the self and the world. The other aim, however, is to patiently work out the respective lines of tension between the desire for resonance and the demand for availability and to gain ideas on how this contradiction might one day be overcome or resolved."

To trace this basic contradiction in all its manifold manifestations and with all its social and psychological consequences, even in places where we would not expect it in our everyday actions and in the social fields of conflict in society, is one objective that I would now like to pursue in the second part of this book in the hope that it will shed some illuminating light on the difficulties in which this modernity finds itself in its relationship to nature as well as in its political and subjective relationship to the self and the world. The other aim, however, is to patiently work out the respective lines of tension between the desire for resonance and the demand for availability and to gain ideas on how this contradiction might one day be overcome or resolved."
