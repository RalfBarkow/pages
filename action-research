Effectively, the distinction of sciences from the everyday only caused the structural enclosure of its reasoning and practice, by isolating forces. To take discoursive responsibility, the use of a qualitative method, to normatively engage in discourses about [[understanding knowledge]], gives momentum to weaving the fragile connections between imaginative, existing and disappeared heterotopoleis."
