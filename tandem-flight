Zu den Westlichen Honigbienen (Apis mellifera) zählen nicht nur die be-imkerten Völker, die der Mensch bereits seit mehreren tausend Jahren gezielt hält, sondern auch die noch zahlreich in ihrem angestammten Lebensraum Wald in hohlen Bäumen nistenden Völker. Sie mussten ohne helfende Eingriffe des Menschen auskommen, sind somit weniger anfällig gegen Krankheiten und tragen wesentlich zur nötigen Biodiversität bei. Diesen “wilden” Honigbienen waren der Verhaltensbiologe Tautz und der Naturfotograf Arndt auf der Spur. Als Ergebnis dieser “Nachstellungen” legen sie diesen attraktiven Bild-Text-Band vor, der den Leser zu den verborgenen Behausungen führt, willkommene Untermieter zeigt, die nicht selten die Bienen bei Umzügen begleiten, und von der Verteidigungsbereitschaft der Insekten berichtet. Auch mit dem Orientierungssinn der Tiere beschäftigen sich die Autoren ausführlich. - Ein interessantes Schau- und Lesebuch, das sowohl den Wildbienen-Fan als auch dem Imker nicht zuletzt durch seine hervorragenden Makroaufnahmen begeistern wird\n"
