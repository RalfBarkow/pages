      "text": "USA media consider documents incriminating Joe Biden's son partially genuine.\n\nThe story could come from a second-rate Cold War spy thriller. But it has the potential to put US President Joe Biden on the spot.\n\nAt the beginning is computer repairman John Paul Mac Isaac. He receives a visit in April 2019, from someone the severely visually impaired Mac Isaac can't quite make out, but who claims to be Hunter Biden, son of former vice president and Democratic front-runner Joe Biden. The man leaves a laptop with water damage for data recovery, but doesn't check in afterward.\n\nThe computer repairman then sifts through the data - and comes across emails that he, a Trump supporter, finds explosive: They could prove that Hunter Biden had done business in Ukraine with proximity to his father, as vice president in charge of the Ukraine dossier. Republicans raise the accusation loudly in those days. The man turns to the FBI, which retrieves the laptop.\n\nAfter that: Radio silence. Even in 2020, when the impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump are still underway. He had blocked $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and called President Volodimir Selensky: The money would only flow if he investigated Joe and Hunter Biden. A whistleblower blew the whistle on the blackmail attempt, the Democrats initiated impeachment proceedings, the Republicans scuttled it. But the computer repairman is perplexed. Why isn't he hearing about the data from Hunter Biden's laptop?\n\nMac Isaac sends copies of the data to Rudy Giuliani, Trump's lawyer. He feeds it to conservative media. Shortly before the 2020 presidential election, the right-wing tabloid \"New York Post\" publishes the first story about the laptop. It's a ready-made meal; Hunter Biden is always good for fat headlines: Money problems, cocaine addiction, divorce, relationship with his brother's widow.\n"

      "text": "Now, a year and a half later, the laptop saga is gracing the front pages of U.S. newspapers again. It had lingered as an unsolved mystery from the presidential campaign. At the time, many media outlets were not given access to the material, could not verify it and held back on reporting.\n\nImmediately, suspicions arose that the story was too incredible to be true. Could the repairman rule out that the device had been planted on him? Had Russian hackers manipulated the data on the computer to influence the presidential election? Twitter and Facebook put the brakes on the Hunter Biden story by stopping it from being shared - and suddenly took on the role of referees in a Democratic discourse. Republicans accused the media and the tech industry of deliberately protecting Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, at the expense of Donald Trump.\n\nNow both the \"New York Times\" and the \"Washington Post\" have reviewed the data from Hunter Biden's laptop. Both came to the same conclusion: at least part of the more than 120,000 emails and documents, 217 gigabytes, should be genuine. Most of the data, however, can no longer be verified. The \"Washington Post\" rejects the accusation that it paid too little attention to the story before the elections: it was denied access to the data until the summer of 2021.\n\nWhat's left to say against Hunter Biden - and against his father? Hunter is under investigation for suspected tax crimes. Recently, he settled a larger tax claim. That could be an indication, according to the New York Times, that Biden is expecting to be indicted and hopes to make the judge and jury lenient. Similarly, authorities are apparently investigating whether Biden violated disclosure rules as a lobbyist for foreign companies."

And now the picture thickens that his son is making money - lots of money - by being close to his father. A state-owned Chinese energy giant alone paid him and his uncle nearly $5 million within 14 months. The Ukrainian energy company Burisma transferred over $100,000 a month to the two. This is unsavory and unethical, to say the least.\n\nWhether some transactions were illegal remains an open question for now. Should an indictment follow, it would certainly resonate with Biden. The story is already a gobstopper for Trump supporters. They question Joe Biden's independence in the conflict with Russia: one conspiracy theory says that Biden provoked the war because his son's business partners profited from it.\n"

Nor is there any evidence that Joe Biden served his son's interests while in office. He consistently claimed that he was not involved with his family members' business. This is remarkable given the great value Biden places on close family ties; he always takes his grandchildren with him on trips, for example. But so far, Biden has also displayed a strong sense of duty."

With respect to Selensky, it is particularly cynical in light of the fact that he is Jewish and lost a large part of his ancestors to German murderers in the Holocaust.\n\nAdmittedly, quite a few men of the Azov regiment are anything but avowed anti-fascists and democrats. The origins of the unit, formerly called the Azov Battalion, go back to Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which is also fiercely contested today. There, ultra-rightists and hooligans from the local fan club FC Metalist Kharkiv were among those who volunteered in 2014 in the beginning war against Russia in eastern Ukraine."

Azov founder Andri Biletsky, for example, declared in 2010 that \"the historic mission of our nation\" was to lead \"the white races of the world in a final crusade for their survival, a crusade against the Semitic-led subhumans. Azov fighters had themselves pictured wearing helmets with SS runes in 2014, and even a year later fighters showed Nazi tattoos and emblems on their uniforms to a Polish journalist.\n\nIn previous years, too, foreign journalists reported on Azov fighters who freely professed to be Nazis - and their great appeal to right-wing radicals and alleged white supremacists from several countries. The English investigative service Bellingcat documented in detail Azov's contacts with U.S. right-wing radicals and the White Supremacy movement. Bellingcat researcher Oleksii Kusmenko judged in the Atlantic Council's Ukraine Service that right-wing radicals had damaged Ukraine's image.\n\nWhy does Ukraine accept right-wing radicals in its ranks? Probably the most essential answer: because it is happy to have anyone who defends the country with a gun. In 2014, when Russia organized the takeover of eastern Ukrainian cities by Russian intelligence agents and local forces controlled by them, and sent weapons and Russian troops to Ukraine, the then run-down Ukrainian army had its back to the wall.

The Azov fighters made a name for themselves on several fronts, including the liberation of Mariupol from the Russian \"separatists\". Meanwhile, in 2014/2015, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights reported several cases of looting, illegal arrests and torture by Azov men.\n\nNevertheless, the battalion was upgraded to a regiment and, like other volunteer battalions, included in a national guard subordinate to the Ministry of Interior.\n\nSince then, Azov, with its headquarters in Mariupol, has been the central defense unit of the strategically paramount port city. The reason is the same as it has been since the start of the war in 2014: the Ukrainian army is overstretched to defend Europe's largest country by area after Russia alone. Political scientist and Ukraine expert Andreas Umland believes that most Ukrainians care little about the symbols and ideology of the Azov fighters, given their military clout."

Its elements include ultranationalism, anti-LGBT actions, and opposition to feminism."

Neither the ultranationalist Svoboda party nor the radical right-wing organization Pravy Sektor nor Azov have significant political support. The Azov offshoot \"National Corps,\" for example, led by Azov founder Biletsky, got just a pitiful 2.15 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election in 2019, even in an alliance with Svoboda and other right-wing radicals."

        "text": "USA media consider documents incriminating Joe Biden's son partially genuine.\n\nThe story could come from a second-rate Cold War spy thriller. But it has the potential to put US President Joe Biden on the spot.\n\nAt the beginning is computer repairman John Paul Mac Isaac. He receives a visit in April 2019, from someone the severely visually impaired Mac Isaac can't quite make out, but who claims to be Hunter Biden, son of former vice president and Democratic front-runner Joe Biden. The man leaves a laptop with water damage for data recovery, but doesn't check in afterward.\n\nThe computer repairman then sifts through the data - and comes across emails that he, a Trump supporter, finds explosive: They could prove that Hunter Biden had done business in Ukraine with proximity to his father, as vice president in charge of the Ukraine dossier. Republicans raise the accusation loudly in those days. The man turns to the FBI, which retrieves the laptop.\n\nAfter that: Radio silence. Even in 2020, when the impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump are still underway. He had blocked $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and called President Volodimir Selensky: The money would only flow if he investigated Joe and Hunter Biden. A whistleblower blew the whistle on the blackmail attempt, the Democrats initiated impeachment proceedings, the Republicans scuttled it. But the computer repairman is perplexed. Why isn't he hearing about the data from Hunter Biden's laptop?\n\nMac Isaac sends copies of the data to Rudy Giuliani, Trump's lawyer. He feeds it to conservative media. Shortly before the 2020 presidential election, the right-wing tabloid \"New York Post\" publishes the first story about the laptop. It's a ready-made meal; Hunter Biden is always good for fat headlines: Money problems, cocaine addiction, divorce, relationship with his brother's widow.\nIn the headlines again\n\nNow, a year and a half later, the laptop saga is gracing the front pages of U.S. newspapers again. It had lingered as an unsolved mystery from the presidential campaign. At the time, many media outlets were not given access to the material, could not verify it and held back on reporting.\n\nImmediately, suspicions arose that the story was too incredible to be true. Could the repairman rule out that the device had been planted on him? Had Russian hackers manipulated the data on the computer to influence the presidential election? Twitter and Facebook put the brakes on the Hunter Biden story by stopping it from being shared - and suddenly took on the role of referees in a Democratic discourse. Republicans accused the media and the tech industry of deliberately protecting Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, at the expense of Donald Trump.\n\nNow both the \"New York Times\" and the \"Washington Post\" have reviewed the data from Hunter Biden's laptop. Both came to the same conclusion: at least part of the more than 120,000 emails and documents, 217 gigabytes, should be genuine. Most of the data, however, can no longer be verified. The \"Washington Post\" rejects the accusation that it paid too little attention to the story before the elections: it was denied access to the data until the summer of 2021.\n\nWhat's left to say against Hunter Biden - and against his father? Hunter is under investigation for suspected tax crimes. Recently, he settled a larger tax claim. That could be an indication, according to the New York Times, that Biden is expecting to be indicted and hopes to make the judge and jury lenient. Similarly, authorities are apparently investigating whether Biden violated disclosure rules as a lobbyist for foreign companies.\nUnsavory and unethical\n\nFor Joe Biden, this is bad news. He has given himself the image of a clean-cut guy who was never rich. And now the picture thickens that his son is making money - lots of money - by being close to his father. A state-owned Chinese energy giant alone paid him and his uncle nearly $5 million within 14 months. The Ukrainian energy company Burisma transferred over $100,000 a month to the two. This is unsavory and unethical, to say the least.\n\nWhether some transactions were illegal remains an open question for now. Should an indictment follow, it would certainly resonate with Biden. The story is already a gobstopper for Trump supporters. They question Joe Biden's independence in the conflict with Russia: one conspiracy theory says that Biden provoked the war because his son's business partners profited from it.\n\nSo far, there is no evidence that the father was involved in or knew about his son's business dealings, even after thoroughly combing through laptop data.

The origins of the unit, formerly called the Azov Battalion, go back to Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, which is also fiercely contested today. There, ultra-rightists and hooligans from the local fan club FC Metalist Kharkiv were among those who volunteered in 2014 in the beginning war against Russia in eastern Ukraine."

Azov founder Andri Biletsky, for example, declared in 2010 that \"the historic mission of our nation\" was to lead \"the white races of the world in a final crusade for their survival, a crusade against the Semitic-led subhumans. Azov fighters had themselves pictured wearing helmets with SS runes in 2014, and even a year later fighters showed Nazi tattoos and emblems on their uniforms to a Polish journalist.\n\nIn previous years, too, foreign journalists reported on Azov fighters who freely professed to be Nazis - and their great appeal to right-wing radicals and alleged white supremacists from several countries. The English investigative service Bellingcat documented in detail Azov's contacts with U.S. right-wing radicals and the White Supremacy movement. Bellingcat researcher Oleksii Kusmenko judged in the Atlantic Council's Ukraine Service that right-wing radicals had damaged Ukraine's image.\n\nWhy does Ukraine accept right-wing radicals in its ranks? Probably the most essential answer: because it is happy to have anyone who defends the country with a gun. In 2014, when Russia organized the takeover of eastern Ukrainian cities by Russian intelligence agents and local forces controlled by them, and sent weapons and Russian troops to Ukraine, the then run-down Ukrainian army had its back to the wall.

The Azov fighters made a name for themselves on several fronts, including the liberation of Mariupol from the Russian \"separatists\". Meanwhile, in 2014/2015, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights reported several cases of looting, illegal arrests and torture by Azov men.\n\nNevertheless, the battalion was upgraded to a regiment and, like other volunteer battalions, included in a national guard subordinate to the Ministry of Interior.\n\nSince then, Azov, with its headquarters in Mariupol, has been the central defense unit of the strategically paramount port city. The reason is the same as it has been since the start of the war in 2014: the Ukrainian army is overstretched to defend Europe's largest country by area after Russia alone. Political scientist and Ukraine expert Andreas Umland believes that most Ukrainians care little about the symbols and ideology of the Azov fighters, given their military clout."

Neither the ultranationalist Svoboda party nor the radical right-wing organization Pravy Sektor nor Azov have significant political support. The Azov offshoot \"National Corps,\" for example, led by Azov founder Biletsky, got just a pitiful 2.15 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election in 2019, even in an alliance with Svoboda and other right-wing radicals."

While the West praises itself for the rare moment of unity, China's foreign minister has flown to India to promote a renewed rapprochement. Soon, Xi could travel to Saudi Arabia. And that is likely to be just the beginning. China's pragmatism has rarely been more merciless."

But so far the confrontation is in China's interest: At home, the war is useful for the ideological confrontation with the U.S.; it helps to intensify anti-Western sentiment. Hatred of the Americans is raging in the Chinese network, and the distance to the West has rarely been greater. Putin and Xi's partnership, however, will outlast the war. The men share a deep friendship. They see the West as a common enemy, share their contempt for the established international order and universal human rights. While Vladimir Putin dreams of a great Russian empire, Xi fabricates allegedly historic claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea. He has made it clear that he will enforce these claims by force if necessary."

The goal is the greatest possible independence from the West, which should make it more difficult for the latter to restrict the Chinese Communist Party (CP) in its actions."

The prerequisite for this is that Europe stops giving itself false hopes. As in Russia, it was not wrong to focus on change through trade. With this strategy, the West also acted in the interest of the Chinese people. But it was naive to believe that the CP would accept such change. The widespread desire among the people for more say and freedoms is one reason for the brutal course under Xi. The reality in China is painful for anyone who cares about the country. But illusions can no longer be the basis for dealing with the regime."

The most pressing question: What are Europe's dependencies on China? Access to the Chinese market still secures hundreds of thousands of jobs in Europe. But China's industrial policy leaves no doubt that foreign companies will not play a decisive role there in the future. They should reduce their dependence on this market - and Europe should reduce its dependence on pharmaceutical and chemical imports from there, for example. The EU is not powerless in this, because the dependence is mutual. China needs it as a market, as a financier and as a source of know-how. The country still has to fear a common front from Europe and the U.S., and it cannot afford an increasing escalation at the moment. Corona and a severe real estate crisis are weighing on it."
