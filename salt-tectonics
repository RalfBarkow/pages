This allowed the salt in the seawater to become very concentrated and it began to precipitate and drop to the ocean floor. Over deep time (a million years), the salt depositional body, called the “mother salt,” grew to 4,000 feet thick, and on land, erosion from the Rocky Mountains and from rifting began to deposit sediments on top of the salt body."
