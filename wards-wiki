I've met Ward in person, heard him speak, and read his contributions here, these experiences have led me to believe that Wiki is an exercise in emergent behavior. I believe that Ward set up the mechanics of Wiki in the hope that they would lead to certain behaviors and is now watching to see if those behaviors emerge. Stepping in to lay down the law might cause the behaviors but it would at least break the experiment and might excite destruction. Perhaps [[Ward Is Like God]] in this way.

I've met Ward in person, heard him speak, and read his contributions here, these experiences have led me to believe that Wiki is an exercise in emergent behavior. I believe that Ward set up the mechanics of Wiki in the hope that they would lead to certain behaviors and is now watching to see if those behaviors emerge. Stepping in to lay down the law might cause the behaviors but it would at least break the experiment and might excite destruction. Perhaps [[Ward Is Like God]] in this way. Since Ward chooses not to wield his influence here by telling us what to do, I feel that it is terribly disrespectful and dishonest of others to use his name in order to increase their own influence. -- [[Phil Goodwin]] ",
