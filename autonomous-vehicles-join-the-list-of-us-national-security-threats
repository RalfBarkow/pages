As Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told a House committee last week, there are perils of having communications infrastructure in the hands of nation-states that don't protect freedoms and rights as we do. FBI director Christopher Wray warned that China has stolen more data from the United States than all other nations combined, through increasingly sophisticated large-scale cyber-espionage operations against a range of industries, organizations, and dissidents in the United States."
