This is the central formula of the modern world-relationship - there is neither orientation by traditions or auctoritas, nor is there any possibility of predicting the future. All this changes at the very time when both the modern novel is invented and probability theory comes to light. Both are reactions to the emergence of modern conditions. While the modern novel presents a 'fictional reality' \"so plausible that it could be true\" (p. 13), probability theory presents a 'real fiction' in that it offers predictions about the future of a world imagined as uncertain."

Esposito, however, manages to shake this quasi-certainty with the help of recourse to historically different conceptions of the relationship between reality and the non-real, and thus serves almost as a tempting invitation to leave one's own thinking routines and to occupy oneself for a few hours with other possibilities of thinking. This is the real strength of this essay. It offers little that is materially new for both the (systems) theory-trained and the historically educated reader, but it does help one to think - and that is sometimes worth more than being presented with something new."

The best example is the modern romance novel, in which the reader plays out certain possible situations that may come to him in future reality. Certainly, dime novels and the television soaps also aim in the same direction, namely to be prepared for future constellations - this is also hinted at in a short chapter on so-called \"reality TV\"."

This takes into account that both the expected electoral successes, consumption trends or stock prices may turn out differently and the expectations themselves may change. Orientation in contemporary modern society is thus highly fictional, and these fictions - and here again the modern novel and probability theory come together - act as a mirror in which society reflects its own contingency and thus learns to deal with the present future."
