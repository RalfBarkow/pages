[…] In a more recent study by Johnson and Keil (2018) subjects were asked to evaluate both general and singular causation claims. This study found an interesting dissociation: While subjects who were asked to evaluate general causation claims (e.g., “Smoking causes cancer”) preferred to consult covariational information, subjects asked to evaluate singular causation claims (e.g., “Jack's smoking caused his cancer”) preferred information about causal mechanisms that could [[link]] the two [[Event]]s."

We\nwill start with a summary of this new model (Stephan et al., 2020;\nStephan & Waldmann, 2018), and then propose an extension that in-\ncorporates causal mechanism information. The extended model not only\nformalizes under which circumstances mechanism information is help-\nful for the assessment of singular causation, it also allows us to identify\nsituations in which mechanism information is less helpful. We will then\npresent the results of three experiments in which we systematically\ntested the predictions of the new model."

In the present research we investigate how reasoners determine the singular cause(s) of an observed event. As opposed to general causation queries that focus on general causal regularities (e.g., “Do contraceptives cause thrombosis?”), singular causation queries refer to causal connections between events that actually occurred in a particular place at a particular time (e.g., “Was Mary's thrombosis caused by the contraceptives she took?”) (see Danks, 2017; Russo & Williamson, 2011, for overviews). Even when a general probabilistic causal relationship between two types of events has been established, the co-occurrence of the two events may still be a coincidence. How do reasoners determine whether a potential cause c actually caused an observed effect e or whether the co-occurrence was a coincidence and e was actually caused by some alternative cause a?"
