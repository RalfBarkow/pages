Time permanence can only be achieved recursively, only by interconnection with other events, i.e. only by system formation, which selectively constitutes the operations that are suitable for this purpose and thus distinguishes itself from the environment of what is not considered. The operation by which social systems and consequently society are constituted is communication. Whenever communication comes about, society is formed, just as, conversely, communication can never occur as a solitary event, but only by recourse to and anticipation of other communications, i.e. only in society."

It is true that the political system divides society into political system and environment (just as society divides the world into communication and non-communication). But society is then both: the political system itself and its environment within society. There is communication inside and outside. This then leads to the question, which we will explore in wide-ranging investigations below: how then the specificity of politics differs from other social communication: by a particular medium (chapter 2), by a particular function (chapter 3), by a particular encoding (chapter 3), or by all of these together?"
