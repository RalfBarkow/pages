Western policy should be judged by whether it effectively supports these aspirations. One can argue whether the inclination toward Putinism is the result of the laziness of thinking on the part of leftists who, even after more than 30 years, have not detached themselves from the categories of the Cold War, whether a certain sympathy with patriarchal systems without gender gaga does not play a role, or whether anti-Americanism has taken on a life of its own altogether. In any case, to maintain equidistance from democracy and dictatorship is to trivialize the attempts of far-right regimes to expand their sphere of domination, and for the left it is suicidal in the long run - because these attempts could be successful."

At the same time, however, the intervening powers courted domestic warlords and rulers who were seen as guarantors of stability. Often little was done to support democracy movements."

They have no objections to the free trade regime; on the contrary, in a joint declaration published at the beginning of February, they advocate \"trade facilitation in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization\" and deplore \"unilateral sanctions.\" Democracy is already practiced \"in all spheres of public life,\" they say, and they have \"1,000 years of experience\" with it and therefore forbid \"interference by outside forces. The rejection of \"color revolutions\" is emphasized, against which one wants to cooperate more closely."

In 2014, Russia responded militarily to the Euromaidan protests that led to the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, annexing Crimea and establishing so-called People's Republics in eastern Ukraine. Putin's motives and goals in the Ukraine conflict may be mysterious in many respects, but it is certain that he sees even Ukraine's democracy, which is mediocre at best, as a threat to his rule."

Western policy should be judged by whether it effectively supports these aspirations. One can argue whether the inclination toward Putinism is the result of the laziness of thinking on the part of leftists who, even after more than 30 years, have not detached themselves from the categories of the Cold War, whether a certain sympathy with patriarchal systems without gender gaga does not play a role, or whether anti-Americanism has taken on a life of its own altogether. In any case, to maintain equidistance from democracy and dictatorship is to trivialize the attempts of far-right regimes to expand their sphere of domination, and for the left it is suicidal in the long run - because these attempts could be successful."
