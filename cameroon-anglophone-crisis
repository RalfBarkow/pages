      "text": "Cameroon’s Anglophone Crisis is rooted in the country’s colonial past. Cameroon, once a German colony, was dismembered by Britain and France at the end of the First World War. France took the lion’s share of the country, while the areas bordering Nigeria were administered under British colonial rule as the British Cameroons. English became their dominant language and common law was practiced in their courts. After French Cameroon gained independence in 1960, the British Cameroons were given a plebiscite to determine their future. The northern half joined Nigeria, while the southern half joined French Cameroon to become the Federal Republic of Cameroon. But the autonomy of the English-speaking territory under the federal system did not last. In 1972, Cameroonian president Ahmadou Ahidjo centralised the country’s governance, dismantling the federation, to the anger of many Anglophones who began to organise. Ahidjo’s successor, President Paul Biya, clamped down on Anglophone activism, despite adding nominal decentralisation measures to the country’s constitution in the 1990s. Anglophone movements continued to protest poor treatment and to call for self-determination. Having ascended to power in 1982, Biya is now the world’s longest ruling non-royal leader.\n\nThe latest iteration of the “Anglophone Problem” began in 2016 when Anglophone lawyers and teachers held peaceful protests against the government’s placement of Francophone judges and teachers in their regions’ courts and schools. The Cameroonian military responded by arresting protest leaders and cutting the internet. With more moderate protest leaders in jail, a separatist movement emerged whose leaders unilaterally declared the independence of the Anglophone regions as the “Republic of Ambazonia” in October 2017.\n\nToday, a conflict rages in which the Cameroonian military battles dozens of non-state armed separatist groups, including opportunistic bandits. There is evidence of war crimes perpetrated by all sides including the state, such as torture, extrajudicial executions and the burning of villages. The UN estimates that 1.1 million of the Anglophone regions’ six million inhabitants have been internally displaced by this fighting, 60,000 of whom have fled to neighbouring Nigeria."
