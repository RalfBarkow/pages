      "text": " A long, long time ago (in the summer of 1984) I wrote a Smalltalk-80 Virtual Machine in C (copious detail here). It was my M.Sc. project at the University of Manchester. I had never written any Smalltalk code before then, nor used a Smalltalk system, but I had read the August 1981 issue of Byte , a special issue on Smalltalk (which I still own). By pure coincidence it was the first issue of Byte I'd ever purchased. I had to figure out how to write the VM from the Smalltalk-80 books, especially the \"Blue Book\" and the \"Green Book\", and the documentation that accompanied the Xerox Smalltalk-80 image. My supervisor, Steve Holden, had visited PARC and seen Smalltalk running, and ordered a copy of the image. I knew nobody else who had ever seen the system, or had written a program in it. Few people I knew outside of Steve's course had even heard of it, or of \"object-oriented programming\".\n\nI started the project in April of 1984. Due to various bureaucratic obstacles (mainly, getting a British University to write a dollar cheque in advance) the image did not arrive until I was almost done, in Dec of 1984 (it was distributed on 1/2\" tape, sent by surface mail). However, the description in the Blue Book was almost complete, and it only took a few weeks with the image documentation to finish the job and start up Smalltalk-80 for the first time. A diary I kept of the development is here. The VM sources are here.\n\nThe experience of studying the Smalltalk-80 books, writing the VM, and using the system, was, to coin a phrase, life-changing. "
