AI offers the potential to expand knowledge, increase prosperity, and provide solutions to global challenges. At the same time, public and private actors have harnessed AI to supercharge cyber attacks and disinformation campaigns, weaken social cohesion, and subvert individual rights. And legal frameworks have yet to grapple with serious questions around algorithmic bias and privacy."
