The Roman emperor had nothing to oppose the power that the Christian counter-sovereign Jesus exercised over the Roman subjects, who called themselves Christians. This counter-sovereign was able to commit his subjects to himself because they freely obeyed him unconditionally. They obeyed precisely because he did not, or even could not, exercise direct coercion.

But it is so firmly anchored as a pure God-state in the souls of the faithful that it could not transform its character, even if it wanted to - and always when it wanted to, this inability showed itself historically practically - into a secular sovereign, into a also secular truth. And so worldly powers arose beside him, which were equal to him in wealth, and militarily highly superior, but just were not also anchored in the souls of the subjects. Thus, two truths existed side by side in the same area in the same persons, but both were logically forced by the principle to want to realize the unity in a real synthesis for themselves alone, but are constantly pushed to not being able to realize it. This western occident was in a deep crisis, which was historically also unique. We know the solution, a solution which, and this is true until today, nobody has ever consciously striven for: capital emerged as the synthesis in which a world-historically new truth, a self-reproducing system, an in itself contradictory \"automatic subject\" asserted itself historically, whose sovereign is as abstract as only the monotheistic God, but also as differentiated in itself as only the Trinitarian Catholic God. In this new unity of all negatively mutually exclusive differences, sovereignty is incarnated in the process of the transformation of money into more money. Money has become capital."

This is especially true for capital, because, as we know, this society is not even capable of developing a concept of itself that could generalize beyond what individual philosophers and some of their students have developed.
