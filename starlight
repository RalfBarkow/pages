Recognizing Orion I wondered again about how long that light has been traveling to end its journey in my retinas: from Betelgeuse, 650 years; from Rigel, 860 years; and from the Orion Nebula, 1500 years. As dozens and then hundreds of stars emerged, how extraordinary it felt to be the one point in all the vastness of the universe where all these faint rays of light  should converge, each born hundreds or thousands of years apart, traveling so unimaginably far to reach me."
