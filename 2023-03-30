        "text": "However, this question cannot be answered with the help of the concept of process, as it should turn out. In chemistry, processes refer too much to results that owe themselves to unclear preconditions, and in jurisprudence, too much to precise preconditions (e.g., the participation of experts) that make it impossible to predict the outcome. The process term is replaced by the network term with precisely the implication that Foucault had in mind, namely to be able to reconstruct singularities genealogically. Networks are coherently heterogeneous, consistently fluid, and fuzzy in their boundaries. They tend to assemble singular elements into principally singular contexts, into \"plateaus\" or \"systems\" like those of which Gilles Deleuze spoke: \"In fact, systems have lost absolutely nothing of their living power. Today, in science, in logic, there are first steps towards a theory of so-called open systems based on interactions: they merely renounce linear causalities and transform the concept of time. (...) A system is an ensemble of concepts. It is an open system if the concepts are related to circumstances and no longer to beings, essences. But on the one hand, the concepts are not ready, they are not already there before: concepts have to be invented, created, and in this there is just as much creation and invention as in art or science. Creating new concepts that have a necessity, that has always been the task of philosophy. On the other hand, the concepts are not general ideas of the spirit of the time. On the contrary, they are singularities that have an effect on the ordinary streams of thought: One can think very well without concepts, but as soon as there is concept, there is truly philosophy. This has nothing to do with ideology. A concept is full of critical, political power and freedom. Just and only the power of the system can work out what is good and bad in a construction of concepts, new or not, alive or not. Nothing is absolutely good, everything depends on its use and cleverness in the system context.\"\n"

If the natural sciences rely on repeatable causality and the social sciences on their interest in the social interconnectedness of social phenomena, cultural studies can give a space to singularities that appear and disappear again without having to be spelled back to natural laws or conform to functional expectations of social order.\n"
