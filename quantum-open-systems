Now we extend the discussion very slightly and consider in detail the simplest quantum system made of two parts, a pair of qubits. Remarkably, this simple step takes us onto new ground within the theory of quantum open systems. We will show that the internal coherence of the two-qubit system exhibits a nonadditive response. We believe that this is the first demonstration of the effect."

Exactly this situation will arise, for example, in a quantum computer, where it is most desirable that two qubits retain a nonzero degree of mutual cross entanglement.

To the extent that joint-system information is a resource of substantial value in one or another practical application of qubit networks, this aspect of time-dependent entanglement will be important. At the same time, it illuminates further the difficult fundamental challenge to understand the nature of coherence in multipartite mixed states, particularly in its timedependent behavior, which has recently come under examination in both continuous spaces [13–15] and discrete spaces (qubit pairs [16 –20], finite spin chains, and elementary lattices [21–24]) and decoherence dynamics in adiabatic entanglement [25], as well as in situations without relaxation [26] and in connection with direct entanglement observation [27]. These have all contributed to increased awareness of this domain."
