This monitoring system is made of a Raspberrypi connected to a temperature sensor and an LCD screen. We deploy the device in the room that we are interested to track. The sensor probes the room’s temperature and displays the result on the LCD screen. This device is connected to the internet via wi-fi. It can be configured to send alarm notifications to a remote user if the temperature of the room exceeds a given level (e.g in a food storage room). The communication is actually bidirectional: the device can also receive updates such as user application and firmware updates."
