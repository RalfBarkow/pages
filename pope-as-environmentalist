      "text": "In 2015, Pope Francis came out as an environmentalist, with his landmark \nencyclical Laudato Si, later called by Bill McKibben \"the most important \ndocument yet of this millennium\" and by Pankaj Mishra \"arguably the most \nimportant piece of intellectual criticism in our time.\"\n\nLast week, with a follow-up apostolic exhortation called Laudate Deum, the pope \ncame even further out as a climate alarmist, a techno-skeptic and a \ndegrowther, sympathetic to activists and, most improbably, a reader of the \nfeminist futurist Donna Haraway, the author of \"A Cyborg Manifesto.\" He also \nemphatically endorsed the \"abandonment\" of fossil fuels outing himself as a \n\"keep it in the ground\" guy as well.\n\nHe is also much angrier than he was eight years ago. Since Laudato Si, the pope \nwrites, \"I have realized that our responses have not been adequate, while the \nworld in which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point.\" In \nhis new exhortation, he invokes the immediate urgency of faster action, takes \npains to offer point-by-point rebuttals of climate denial and climate \ncomplacency, including corporate complicity and widespread greenwashing, attacks \nthe \"technocratic\" worldview he sees behind planetary exploitation, defends \nclimate protesters by describing them as filling a vacuum of global leadership, \nand calls out \"the ethical decadence of real power.\" He describes unignorable \nepisodes of extreme weather as the \"cries of protest on the part of the earth \nthat are only a few palpable expressions of a silent disease that affects \neveryone.\" And he returns to a two-part mantra he says he reiterates often: \n\"Everything is connected\" and \"No one is saved alone.\"\n\nThis is quite radical language, even for a pope who has long plotted his own \ncomplicated course as an outspoken progressive, alienating many Catholics along \nthe way. But he is also on a journey familiar to many of those most concerned \nabout climate, from grief and lamentation through exhortation to a position of \nmore strident and more pointed outrage. Last month, I wrote about the change in \ntone from activist groups and climate establishmentarians toward the fossil-fuel \nindustry. In Laudate Deum, Pope Francis channels that frustration, too, but he \nis more focused and withering on the failures of climate geopolitics since the \npublication of Laudato Si.\n\nA lot has changed between 2015 and 2023 when it comes to climate, and yet an \nawful lot hasn\"t as well. Emissions from the global electricity sector may soon \nbe reaching their peak, the energy research group Ember just announced, and the \nInternational Energy Agency recently declared that there was still a workable \npathway to net zero emissions in 2050 and that following it would save the \nworld $12 trillion.\n\nOn the other hand, emissions are still setting records, and climate extremes and \ndisasters, often powered or supercharged by warming, have come to seem like so \nmany features of our news wallpaper.\n\nEight years ago, when Laudato Si was published, most anyone looking soberly at \nthe state of the climate from any perspective would see the same story: massive \nchanges to come and yet little being done, at any scale, to mitigate warming and \nlimit the damage. Today, energy optimism is, broadly speaking, warranted. But so \nis some climate pessimism.\n\nThis is where the pope is. And he is not shy about saying so. \"The necessary \ntransition,\" he writes, \"is not progressing at the necessary speed. \nConsequently, whatever is being done risks being seen only as a ploy to distract \nattention.\" To expect technical interventions alone to resolve the climate \ncrisis is \"a form of homicidal pragmatism, like pushing a snowball down a hill.\"\n\nIf in Laudato Si, Pope Francis wrapped concern for the future of the planet in \nthe plaintive language of spiritual sickness, here he wields a much more \npolitical, even legalistic tone. In his short exhortation, Francis devotes long \nstretches of text to \"rethinking our use of power, \"the weakness of \ninternational politics\" and \"climate conferences: progress and failures,\" before \ndevoting an entire section to the question: What to expect from COP 28 in Dubai?\n\nHis answer: To say that there is nothing to hope for would be suicidal, for it \nwould mean exposing all humanity, especially the poorest, to the worst impacts \nof climate change.\" But based on the recent past and the conditions of this U.N. \nclimate conference in the United Arab Emirates and run by the head of the Abu \nDhabi National Oil Company, he does not seem especially hopeful.\n\n\"We must move beyond the mentality of appearing to be concerned but not having \nthe courage needed to produce substantial changes,\" he writes.\n\nOnce and for all, let us put an end to the irresponsible derision that would \npresent this issue as something purely ecological, \"green,\" romantic, frequently \nsubject to ridicule by economic interests. Let us finally admit that it is a \nhuman and social problem on any number of levels. For this reason, it calls for \ninvolvement on the part of all. In conferences on the climate, the actions of \ngroups negatively portrayed as \"radicalized\" tend to attract attention. But in \nreality, they are filling a space left empty by society as a whole, which ought \nto exercise a healthy pressure, since every family ought to realize that the \nfuture of their children is at stake.\n\nFor those who have left that space empty, he is especially unforgiving. \"To the \npowerful, I can only repeat this question: What would induce anyone, at this \nstage, to hold on to power, only to be remembered for their inability to take \naction when it was urgent and necessary to do so?\"\n"
