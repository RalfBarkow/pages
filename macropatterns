But governing a local commons requires different patterns than, say, governing a bioregion  -- just as the patterns for building a house are different from those for building a city. At whatever level, the architecture of the respective governance system needs to address essential patterns of commoning, so that no collective concern remains unseen. The scale of an entire socio-ecological system may pose new challenges and demand new responses than commoning at a smaller scale, but appropriate macro-patterns also provide new affordances for coordination, communication and action."
