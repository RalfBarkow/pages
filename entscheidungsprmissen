Organizations enable themselves to generate internal complexity that still needs to be determined by deciding on decision premises for further decisions. By \"premise\" it should be said that they are premises that are no longer tested when they are used; or perhaps better: that relevance to the problem at hand matters, but not the truth of the premise. Moreover, it should be noted that the relation of premise to decision is neither a logical nor a causal relation. Neither can the decision be deduced from its premises; nor are the premises the causes of the decision, so that the system could be causally concluded by establishing premises. Therefore, it has become common today to refer to the relationship between premise and decision and, depending on it, the relationship between decisions as \"loose coupling.\" In other words, by making decisions on decision premises, one can save decision costs, but in return one must accept decisions that are not fully specified."

The term becomes fruitful only through a further (and at the same time paradoxical) qualification: there are decisions that establish decision premises for an as yet undetermined multitude of other decisions.
