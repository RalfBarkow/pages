      "text": "Deepfakes of celebrities have started to appear in ads, with and without their consent. Experts say the growing use of deepfake software could change the marketing industry significantly while raising new legal and ethical issues, making it difficult for celebrities to rein in unauthorized digital reproductions and brand manipulation. U.S. legislative efforts to contain deepfakes include criminalization of their use in revenge porn in Virginia, and a Texas ban on their use in political campaigns. However, experts cite a lack of legislation addressing deepfake usage in commercials, and anticipate as a result deepfakes will become increasingly popular in advertising."
