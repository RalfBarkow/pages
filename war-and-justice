        "text": "Der Dokumentarfilm geht der Frage nach, warum es so schwierig ist, Aggressoren und ihre Angriffskriege vor den Internationalen Strafgerichtshof (ICC) in Den Haag zu bringen. Im März 2023 hat der ICC Haftbefehl gegen Russlands Präsidenten Wladimir Putin erlassen. Der Vorwurf: die Verschleppung ukrainischer Kinder. Im Hinblick auf den Angriff der Ukraine hat der ICC keine Handhabe gegen Putin, da der ICC gemäß seinen Statuten nur ermitteln kann, wenn die Zustimmung des Aggressors, in diesem Fall Russlands, vorliegt.\nAm 7. Oktober 2023 verübt die Hamas ein grausames Massaker an israelischen Zivilisten. Israel antwortet mit der größten Offensive auf Gaza, die es je gegeben hat. Der Krieg droht zu eskalieren. ICC-Chefankläger Karim Khan reist in den Nahen Osten und kündigt an, jede Art von Kriegsverbrechen auf beiden Seiten zu verfolgen.\n\nDer Dokumentarfilm macht die Bedeutung des ICC deutlich und wirft einen Blick auf seine Entstehung, Erfolge und Probleme. Können Kriegsverbrechen überhaupt verhindert werden oder hat Ben Ferencz, ehemaliger Ankläger der Nürnberger Prozesse, recht, wenn er sagt, dass das größte Verbrechen der Krieg selbst ist?\nIm Genre eines Justizthrillers erzählen Marcus Vetter und Michele Gentile, die bereits 2009 am ICC drehten, wie der erste international legitimierte Strafgerichtshof gegen Kriegsverbrecher ermittelt. \"[[War and Justice]]\" ist ein leidenschaftliches Plädoyer für den Frieden.\n"
