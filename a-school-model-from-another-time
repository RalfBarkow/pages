In the current school model, children are still and repeatedly held for standardized periods of about an hour so that they can be presented with things to memorize, often without explaining why. Exams usually focus on recapitulating what has been heard. Often what is learned is more part of a rite of passage and quickly forgotten. Beyond writing and arithmetic, the real learning takes place in the social interaction of students and in the difficult process of growing up. In many rural regions, school attendance in itself, the presence of a competent teacher and functioning toilets is an achievement.\nEverything else is a beautiful dream there. The clearly structured hierarchical school system, which often leads to a higher level of education, makes something truly invaluable possible: social mobility. Because with social mobility comes the hope of a better life, not only for the graduates but also for their families. But just because you can climb that ladder, and because many classrooms now have whiteboards and computers instead of chalkboards, doesn't mean you get a better education. If the five turnarounds show us anything, it's this: Much of our current problems stem from 19th-century reductionist and linear-causal thinking, according to which the world is a machine that can be broken down into its component parts and understood.\n\n"

After all, the most significant challenge of our day is not climate change, biodiversity loss, or pandemics. The most significant problem is our collective inability to distinguish between fact and fiction. In democratic societies, misinformation and falsehood have been contained, at least to some degree, by the mass media. But social media have shattered that model. They have given rise to an entire industry of misinformation and disinformation, fostering the polarization of societies and a loss of trust, and contributing to our inability to collaborate or even agree on basic facts in the face of collective challenges.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the issue of mask-wearing became the subject of politically polarizing debates in some countries, in which empirical evidence was ignored, derided, or ridiculed. The result was many more deaths that could have been avoided. Misguided developments like these are based on a systemic problem that requires long-term solutions. Education systems have a role to play in fostering critical thinking so that the coming generation is able to navigate around this minefield of disinformation.\n\nThe second cornerstone of education is complex systems thinking. The Earth4All model is grounded in systems dynamics and systems thinking - tools that were applied fifty years ago in The Limits to Growth. Most real-world systems, be they the world's oceans, climate, urbanization, or stock markets, are complex and dynamic. An educational system that largely ignores these fundamental features until students enter university is obsolete. The knowledge used by indigenous peoples is often based on a systems view, an understanding of complexity, and approaches to narrative learning. These approaches could be integrated into new curricula based on systems thinking. Both of these pillars are essential to developing a fundamental skill we need as we move into the future: adaptive leadership, the ability to take informed and decisive action under rapidly changing conditions.\n\n"
