I test hypotheses developed from this argument in an event history analysis of the diffusion of a new music radio format. Results show that low organizational inertia, caused by events such as a recent ownership or format change, strongly increases the likelihood of adoption, while social proximity to prior adopters has a weaker effect. The results imply that organizational populations can become more diverse through this type of organizational change."
