      "text": "Traditionally, classrooms are predominantly work-orientated. As Ron Ritchart describes, students do ‘the work’, teachers and parents are ‘monitors of the work’ and the 'language of work' upholds these messages. Learning is a passive process that occurs if the work is completed quickly to the appropriate standard and is, most importantly, correct. At Griffin, exploring Ritchhart's work was unsettling and inspired an immediate response in our classrooms. Rewriting this outdated narrative and allowing the new story of learning to emerge is our work."

At Griffin, we aspire to cultivate classrooms where learning is seen as the learner’s work, habitats where teachers and parents are ‘monitors for the learning’. We use [[Intentional Language]] to reinforce our belief that learning is about developing understanding and skills, not just knowledge. In our learning-orientated classrooms, we value that learning is an active process that is defined by changes in thinking. We don't aspire for our classrooms to be quiet, instead we aim for an unmistakeable hum, one that communicates deep curiosity and truly joyful and active learning. "

The real work, however, must begin with us. We must shift our mindset, our stance, how we view our role. In order to transform our classrooms, we must first transform ourselves. If consciously curated, classrooms might manifest a culture that ignites learning with far greater potential."
