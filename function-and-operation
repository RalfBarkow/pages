This may be irrelevant in individual cases. But if such individual cases increase in frequency, i.e. if small social systems are increasingly overburdened with the task of regulating such occurrences purely internally, and the resulting conflicts soon affect society as a whole, the question arises, with reference to the whole, in which matters a rejection of certain requests for action, which are indispensable for the stabilization of the social order, becomes completely unacceptable. From this point of view, for these matters a collectively binding regulation and the possibility of a threat of the use of force in case of violation is needed in order to be able to appear sufficiently assertive, and thus the differentiation of a specifically political system that has the exclusive function of deciding such questions in a collectively binding way by means of power."

The claim to exclusivity of this attribution of functions suggests that the political system is the control center of modern society. This impression is deceptive. Because of the fact that not only the political system, but all subsystems of modern society are autonomous, a direct control of the processes of other systems by politics would amount to a sensitive disturbance of their functioning, if necessary to their destruction. In this respect, collectively binding decision-making can initially only mean setting certain framework conditions within which the activity of the systems is allowed to unfold freely (for this purpose, for example, fundamental rights are conceived as an institution), and preventing otherwise illegal potentials for conflict and violence by threatening the legitimate use of force by the state, while manifest conflicts and acts of violence that nevertheless occur are punished by certain negative sanctions, in the worst case deprivation of liberty through imprisonment."

      "text": "The crucial point here, when the self-determination of the political system is under discussion, is neither the question of the collective, which aims at the presupposition of the people, nor the question of the binding of this collective (be it the manner, the degree or the effectiveness of this binding), but the moment of decision. For this indicates a clear criterion that distinguishes the specificity of the political system, in that not every communication that has a politically relevant issue as its object seems suitable to represent great politics, but only that form of communication that can be considered a decision about such issues or is concerned with them. Thus, the political system includes politically intentional communications that propose, prepare, announce, announce, or comment on political decisions. \"One can call 'politics' any communication that serves to prepare collectively binding decisions by testing and condensing their chances of consensus\" (PolG, 254). Furthermore, Luhmann makes it clear that not all political operations serve the handling and reproduction of political power. Nevertheless, for the autopoiesis of the political system, it depends only on collectively binding decisions as the central form of operation, which is carried out solely by the state, the center of the political system. Here, the question of political function has, as it were, a prejudicial effect on the question of political operation, and the state takes on the representation of the political system as a superorganization (SA4, 74-103)."

      "text": "Of course, it should be noted in this context that no functional system can be described solely as an organization, not even the political one. The state has always had the advantage of being taken as a part of the whole. The fixation on the state in the view of politics has a tradition, so to speak. But the unity of the political system does not result at all from the unity of the state, and thus the elementary operation of the political system cannot be political decision-making, which can only be considered as an elementary operation of (political) organizations. This becomes very clear at the point where Luhmann refers the unity of the political system to its internal differentiation according to center and periphery. According to this, the state constitutes only a subarea of the political system, even though it should have become common to \"describe the unity of the (political) system in terms of the center (state)\" (PolG, 252). But the periphery belongs to the political system just as much as the entire 'interior space' between the political center and the periphery of politics as a system, and here decisions are by no means merely made, and if they are, then without far-reaching consequences for political events (cf. P). In this respect, the question remains by what means one can identify the specific form of communication of politics as a system in its entirety. This question leads to the binary coding of the political system."
