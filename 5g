      "text": "The spectrum of 5G is divided into multiple bands, and different countries have different licensed spectrum bands. For example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of the United States has deployed multiple bands above 24 GHz for 5G mobile communications, including the 24-GHz (24.25–24.45/24.75–25.25 GHz), 37 GHz (37.6–38.6 GHz), 39-GHz (38.6–40 GHz), and 47-GHz (47.2–48.2 GHz) bands. In addition to the licensed bands, further unlicensed bands need to be developed [3]–[5]. Therefore, for mm-wave 5G communications, an ultra-wideband system is essential to support the multiple licensed and unlicensed bands simultaneously. To build wideband mm-wave transceivers for 5G applications, the frequency synthesizers are the most critical blocks. However, the first-stage frequency divider in frequency synthesizers creates a bottleneck since it must operate in the mm-wave frequency bands and cover the multi-band voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs)."
