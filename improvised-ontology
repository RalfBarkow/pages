Anxious to compose a concrete music yet perpetually dissatisfied, he roves from conventional instruments to unconventional tools, from the recording studio to the booth, percussing and sounding object after object to find a suitable candidate. The list of objects is a veritable abécédaire: alarm clocks, bicycle horns, birdcalls, bits of wood, clappers, coconut shells, klaxons, organ pipes, rattles, vibrating metal strips, whirligigs; then recordings of bells, buffer stops, orchestras, piano improvisations, trains, xylophones, and zanzis. Throughout his experiments, Schaeffer remains in the grip of two recurrent desires: a compositional desire to construct music from concrete objects—no matter how unsatisfactory the initial results—and a theoretical desire to find a vocabulary, solfège, or method upon which to ground such music. In those early days, Schaeffer’s improvised compositional techniques were indissociable from an improvised ontology, not only in search of a concrete music but a basic theoretical unit upon which to compose such music."

Yet, in the very same journal entry, the “sound object” returns, albeit transformed, to reassert its priority. Schaeffer writes:"

In Schaeffer’s improvised ontology, the sound object has leapfrogged over the fragment to assume a new significance. More than simply a sample or bit of recorded sound, the sound object now suggestively appears to designate something “discrete and complete,” the fruit of a mode of “considering” or listening to the fragment torn from the whole. It seems to be the disclosure of a minimal unit of heard sound upon which to ground the project of *musique concrète*, a novel discovery that cannot be assimilated into “music theory.”"

      "text": "Despite the constant drift of Schaeffer’s terminology over the course of 1948, the claim that a sound object is inassimilable into music theory is intriguing. The earliest works of *musique concrète* were made using special phonograph discs with a locked or closed groove (*sillon fermé*) to create repetitive units. Eventually, these discs were replaced with magnetic tape, where small loops or isolated segments would undergo electronic processing or be repeated without variations. These small pieces of recorded sound, which often underwent elaborate manipulation, filtering, signal processing, and editing, acted as stand-ins for the motive, the smallest musical gestalt deployed to organize the surface of musical works. However, these bits of sound were radically discontinuous with the motive, in that composition with sound objects displaced the note or tone as music’s fundamental ontological unit."

      "text": "By choosing to identify his practice as *musique concrète*, Schaeffer was trying to differentiate his approach from traditional practices of musical composition bound to the note. Abstract music, which Schaeffer contrasted with *musique concrète*, was music that began with the note, organized its musical thinking in terms of the note, and then draped it in the guise of acoustic or electronic sound. Abstract music gave the ideal note a sonorous body through the realization of scores by performers or engineers. It began silently in the head and ended in the vibrating garment of sound. German *elektronische Musik*, a child of serialism, was just such an abstract music. With its “rules … formulated like an algebra,” Schaeffer disparagingly referred to it as “music *a priori*.” Concrete music was to be the exact opposite—a music that began with sounds recorded from the world and sought to perceive in them (and abstract from them) musical values. The emphasis was placed on listening; the ear would have to train itself to hear these new musical values unique to the sonic materials deployed."

      "text": "The “sound object,” first conceived in the improvised ontology of Schaeffer’s experiments in the spring of 1948, would continue to undergo modification and explication for the next two decades—but it always retained the features of discreteness and completeness that characterized its initial leap ahead of the sound fragment. In explicating and clarifying his theory of the sound object, Schaeffer introduced the concept of the acousmatic. “The sound object,” Schaeffer tersely states, “is never revealed clearly except in the acousmatic experience.” In what follows, I try to show why this is indeed the case. To do so, I will explicate Schaeffer’s mature theory of acousmatic experience, the sound object, and reduced listening (écoute réduite) as presented in the Traité des objets musicaux. This theory is cast in explicitly phenomenological terms, and I  argue that Schaeffer’s phenomenology is much closer to Husserl than it is to Schaeffer’s French contemporary, Maurice Merleau-Ponty. For without a good understanding of the Husserlian preoccupations of Schaeffer’s work, one cannot adequately characterize the relationship between acousmatic experience, the sound object, and reduced listening. Once those various parts of Schaeffer’s mature theory have been distinctly separated, the theory and practice of acousmatic listening — the real focus of interest in this book — can begin to be addressed."

        "text": "Identifying the sound fragment was an important step in breaking the grip of the physical-causal source. The recorded fragment, not the physical source, acquired the plasticity of compositional material. By removing the attack from a recording of a bell, Schaeffer noted, “the bell becomes an oboe sound.” Similarly, “if I compensate for the drop in intensity with the potentiometer, I get a drawn-out sound and can move the continuation at will.” The transformations of the “cut bell,” or cloche coupée, produced unexpected auditory results and revealed the potential of recorded sounds when considered separately from their physical-causal sources."

        "text": "By May 15th, Schaeffer’s work with both bells and trains led to a generic conclusion about the sound fragment. “For the ‘concrete’ musician there is no difference between the cut bell and the piece of train: they are ‘sound fragments.’” The sound fragment reduces the specific difference of the physical-material source to the generality of the sample. Yet, in the very same journal entry, the “sound object” returns, albeit transformed, to reassert its priority. Schaeffer writes:"

The earliest works of *musique concrète* were made using special phonograph discs with a locked or closed groove (*sillon fermé*) to create repetitive units. Eventually, these discs were replaced with magnetic tape, where small loops or isolated segments would undergo electronic processing or be repeated without variations. These small pieces of recorded sound, which often underwent elaborate manipulation, filtering, signal processing, and editing, acted as stand-ins for the motive, the smallest musical gestalt deployed to organize the surface of musical works. However, these bits of sound were radically discontinuous with the motive, in that composition with sound objects displaced the note or tone as music’s fundamental ontological unit."
