But severer sanctions lead to an expansion of available enforcement devices/mecanisms or bureaucracy. Does a group of commoners really want this? \n- A harsh sanctioning practice does not only change the infractor but also that of the peer monitor, i.e it changes the commoner's spirit. (cf. George Tsebelis' work)\n- High formal sanctions may lead to less \"voluntary self-compliance\", and actually this self-compliance is only threatened in the case of repeated rule-violation. \n- When the increase in formal sanctions leads to a loss in conformism, more and more severe sanctions seem to be needed.

Infraction 9n the commons in the context of collective disaster:\n\n<blockquote> \nAlmost all the villagers knew that almost all the other villagers were breaking the rules: sneaking around the commons at night, cutting trees that were larger than the allowed size, even using wood-cutting tools that were not permitted. his is precisely the behavior that could get a tragedy of the commons started, but it did not happen in Yamanaka. Instead of regarding the general breakdown of rules as an opportunity to become full-time free riders and cast caution to the winds, the violators themselves tried to exercise self-discipline out of deference to the to the preservation of the commons, and stole from the commons only out of desperation. Inspectors or other witnesses who saw violations maintained silence out of sympathy for the violators' desperation and  out of confidence that the problem was temporary and could not really hurt the commons' (McKean, 1986: 566)."

Instead of regarding the general breakdown of rules as an opportunity to become full-time free riders and cast caution to the winds, the violators themselves tried to exercise self-discipline out of deference to the to the preservation of the commons, and stole from the commons only out of desperation. Inspectors or other witnesses who saw violations maintained silence out of sympathy for the violators' desperation and  out of confidence that the problem was temporary and could not really hurt the commons' (McKean, 1986: 566)."

It can also lead to less passive and active [[peer monitoring]]. -> One can more often \"look the other way\", peer regulatory interest might decrease. (This can be different, when there is a spill-over effect, that is: if one is sanctioned, others are hurt as well as it happens in  collective sanctions).\n- Sanctions need to be applied to be credible. But severer sanctions lead to an expansion of available enforcement devices/mecanisms or bureaucracy. Does a group of commoners really want this? \n- A harsh sanctioning practice does not only change the infractor but also that of the peer monitor, i.e it changes the commoner's spirit. (cf. George Tsebelis' work)\n- High formal sanctions may lead to less \"voluntary self-compliance\", and actually this self-compliance is only threatened in the case of repeated rule-violation. \n- When the increase in formal sanctions leads to a loss in conformism, more and more severe sanctions seem to be needed. This creates a vicious cicle and therefore, doesn't make sense. "

Infraction 9n the commons in the context of collective disaster:\n\n<blockquote> \nAlmost all the villagers knew that almost all the other villagers were breaking the rules: sneaking around the commons at night, cutting trees that were larger than the allowed size, even using wood-cutting tools that were not permitted. his is precisely the behavior that could get a tragedy of the commons started, but it did not happen in Yamanaka. Instead of regarding the general breakdown of rules as an opportunity to become full-time free riders and cast caution to the winds, the violators themselves tried to exercise self-discipline out of deference to the to the preservation of the commons, and stole from the commons only out of desperation. Inspectors or other witnesses who saw violations maintained silence out of sympathy for the violators' desperation and  out of confidence that the problem was temporary and could not really hurt the commons' (McKean, 1986: 566)."
