Too many times. \n\nThe problem is that an alarmingly large percentage of teachers and professors are either blissfully unaware or knowingly ignorant of the role emotions play in learning.

But you can’t just pop a few pills and get the brain to produce these chemicals. \n\nSo, what can you do?\n\nAs it turns out, getting students to experience strong emotions before and during a learning activity greatly increases the production of neurotransmitters which aid learning.

Games are fun and get the children excited, often boosting their ability to understand topics in a manner which mimics game-like situations. A key component of games is uncertainty — not knowing which path to take or which ball to choose often leads to surprises, again boosting the brain’s production of various neurotransmitters which aid learning \n\nOn a fundamental level, organising learning activities in a way that piques emotions like wonder, awe and curiosity also satisfies another neuroscience principle:\n\nWe don’t pay attention to boring things. \n\nSo a learning activity which satisfies both conditions (igniting a flurry of emotions and is interesting) primes the brain and puts it in an ideal state for learning to occur. \n\nAdmittedly, the way the education system is currently designed doesn’t always cater to the conditions laid out above. Textbooks hardly ignite curiosity. In fact, most textbooks would put you to sleep even if you’ve just had a strong brew of coffee. \n\nAs a result, the onus is on progressive educators to up their game and deviate from expected norms to ensure that the conditions for learning are ripe. Planning lessons and activities so as to ignite emotion and wonder takes work. And teachers already have so many demands placed on them. Stressing on the process rather than the outcome (again not a natural line of thinking for most people involved in education) will go a long way to ensuring that classroom practices align with scientific principles of learning.  \n\nAn Example of Teaching Probability\nI was teaching probability to 5th and 6th graders last year. The workbook examples were all the usual suspects - there are 5 red balls and 3 blue balls, what is the chance of drawing a red ball etc. We went through the workbook questions and the response from the children was lukewarm. Children understood the concept but it wasn't apparent that they saw how pervasive the study of probability is.\n\n\nSo over the next few classes, I devised a few probability games. These were simple games of chance where the outcomes were uncertain depending on the choices being made. This is where the class came alive. They played and played and took their understanding to new levels. The module on probability finished with the children devising their own games - calculating payoffs, expected values and even being able to price games in the same way a casino does. That is what happens when you can tap into the emotions of children! \n\n-Ryan Chadha"
