Obviously you're depending on an external scheduler to support the heartbeat monitors, but (for the [[Spike Solution]]) I think that choice is appropriate; in the long run, I want the primary scheduler to be <i>part of</i> the [[Wiki Ide]], which is necessary so it can be upgraded from within the [[Wiki Ide]] to support distributed operations and server-farms and bare-metal installation. This, of course, means that the heartbeat monitors will almost certainly be running on an upgradeable scheduler. Fun, eh?

In the [[Wiki Way]], these external algorithms, values, and data are automatically integrated into the local project where the [[Wiki Word]] names are used, which requires using a language that knows how to do the integration (i.e. a common language, or a 'super'-language that is really smart about it).

However, I spend much of my day quite happily working in the [[Eclipse Ide]], I grit my teeth when I have to edit in a browser textbox, and I've written a fair whack of browser-side [[Java Script]], so I have a very hard time imagining that a browser textbox can provide anywhere near the same speed and functionality, even with (for example) a [[Tiddly Wiki]]-like festoonment of [[Java Script]]-based enhancement. I suspect the idea will be much more viable (as far as I can see, at least) when browser capability is considerably more advanced than it is now. I'm still skeptical, but I'm starting to like the idea, and would be very interested in exploring the minimal infrastructure necessary to support the essential attributes of a [[Wiki Ide]]. Toward that end, I'd be happy to collaborate on creating a [[Spike Solution]], and can donate some server resources to trying it. If adequately designed, I believe it should be possible, over time, to evolve the spike into the system described above entirely via the Wiki interface.</i>",

One one hand: [[You Aint Gonna Need It]] (yet) - it would eventually allow for more flexible client-end support (especially regarding use of [[Object Browser]]s). On the other hand, it might actually be simpler to inject two high-level transforms (with [[Xslt Language]] or similar) than it is to write one low-level transform by hand, and coming up with this intermediate layer would offer a fine place to <i>think</i> about how to do it properly.

I'll add them to the approaches listed in [[Runtime Upgradeable Core]] (to be used in combination with, not instead of). Obviously you're depending on an external scheduler to support the heartbeat monitors, but (for the [[Spike Solution]]) I think that choice is appropriate; in the long run, I want the primary scheduler to be <i>part of</i> the [[Wiki Ide]], which is necessary so it can be upgraded from within the [[Wiki Ide]] to support distributed operations and server-farms and bare-metal installation. This, of course, means that the heartbeat monitors will almost certainly be running on an upgradeable scheduler. Fun, eh? The scheduler + network reachibility (either of which is useless without the other) will ultimately be primary points-of-failure in the [[Wiki Ide]] system (whether it is distributed or not), which really means that we'll want to eventually support the construction of rescue-disks.",

I won't even consider trying to make the C++ language & compiler itself upgradeable - that doesn't get pretty. The '[[Wiki Way]]' would involve describing services or algorithms or values or data on pages identified by [[Wiki Word]]s on, as much as possible, a 'flat' namespace (excepting where projects need special implementations, common page-addendums like discussions, user:prefs, etc.). This avoids any need to:specify:words:like:this or worse (namespaces at least can be associated with 'using namespace' declarations and autogen disambiguation lists). In the [[Wiki Way]], these external algorithms, values, and data are automatically integrated into the local project where the [[Wiki Word]] names are used, which requires using a language that knows how to do the integration (i.e. a common language, or a 'super'-language that is really smart about it). In addition to providing an example of what <i>not</i> to do (and one taking tons and tons of pages), the Apache implementation would also divide mindshare when it comes to fixing perceived 'webserver' problems: one can go about attempting to fix Apache or some component of it, or one can start building a [[Web Server]] that really is a [[First Class]] [[Wiki Ide]] product.",
