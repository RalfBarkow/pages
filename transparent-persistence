When doing most of the processing in collection-oriented systems, such as [[Ex Base]], one tends to see a pattern of a distinction between \"cataloged\" info and non-cataloged. Cataloging means that one explicitly gives something a name and/or identify, which may be a \"path\". I've used a lot of \"temp tables\" which are not assumed to be \"kept\" and are treated more or less like locally-scoped variables. I've used other non-DB systems, such as statistical packages, that have \"session\" collections that are only \"saved\" if you explicitly go through a \"save\" step of some kind, or <b>pre-designate</b> the collection as a cataloged collection. When using a file system explicitly, the processing of \"saving\" is generally the cataloging step. It's not so much about disks, but about the human action of \"cataloging\". Temporary collections may also use disk, but it's a matter of having some kind of \"index\" or registering step so that it can be found again later. -t",

When you power up your computer again, the [[Ex Base]] process fires up and continues that process right from where it left off (or close enough that you can't tell the difference). You didn't need to restart that operation. You didn't need to rebuild those \"temp tables\" from scratch. You didn't even need to give those 'temp tables' any names for an index or catalog. This would widely be considered [[Transparent Persistence]] of process (likely provided by the [[Operating System]]) despite the fact that those tables and the whole [[Ex Base]] operation are 'volatile' compared to the other processes.</i>",

There are many reasons we <b>don't</b> widely have [[Transparent Persistence]], of which you name just one: consistency issues. Others include: recovery of networked services, and dealing with upgrade (if everything is persistent, then you are essentially forced to treat all upgrades as occurring at runtime, which requires we revise our software distribution models), and achieving all this without sacrificing performance or security. That's a lot to bring together at one time, and it would help a lot to have support from the hardware ([[Bubble Memory]], MMU), OS, language implementations, language and service design (idempotence, [[Live Programming]]), and network protocols. I will note that [[Atomic Consistent Isolated Durable]] is stronger than necessary: for persistence we don't care about 'atomic' or 'isolated'; we do want 'durable' and 'consistent'. 'Consistent', in this case, means that the power disruption is either invisible to the program or has well-defined semantics. You might not be willing to pay for the atomicity or isolation properties, though they may be useful for other purposes.</i>",
