      "text": "First, we review well-known results in open-loop coherent control. Open-loop controllers act without obtaining knowledge about the underlying state of the system. More precisely, the controller is provided with some information about the system’s initial state, but obtains no further information during the control process. In the quantum case, an open-loop coherent controller acts by applying time-dependent potentials (igi(t)Hi to the system. Controllability is the problem of taking a quantum system from some initial state to a desired final state. A quantum system is open-loop controllable if the potentials can be modulated by varying gi(t) so as to take the system from an arbitrary known initial state uc& to a desired final state ucd&. This form of controllability is called open loop because the initial state of the system is assumed to be known, and no measurement is made on the system. The problem of coherent open-loop controllability of finite-dimensional Hamiltonian quantum systems has long been known to possess an elegant geometric solution."
