There seem to be no way to link to a specific page.\nHowever you can grab its pointer with site information. Create a new _Factory_ (by pressing \"+\"), drag it wherever you want it, then drag the colorful rectangle of the foreign site page into it. (You may need to SHIFT+click its link to keep it open, or other black magic methods.)\n\nAnother way is to create a neighbour-inviting-machine! It's called __Roster__ plugin, and you throw in the site names (without http, since, the philosophy here seems to be that no site shall be secure), and you get a cute neighbour-collecting double arrow! Pressing it populates your bottom line and dead links may live again! (Untilâ€¦)\n\n"
