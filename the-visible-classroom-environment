      "text": "After a visit from Kath Murdoch in early 2018, we began to consider more deeply The Visible Classroom Environment. Murdoch’s feedback poised us to consider the visible evidence of inquiry as a stance both inside our classrooms and around our school. This spurred us into action considering the walls of our classrooms, what was posted on them and why what was there mattered. ‘Mattering’ spoke of purpose to us and led to the exploration of static and dynamic displays, a controversial journey that uncomfortably cracked open some out-dated ideas.

      "text": "Our exploration of The Visible Classroom Environment was a fierce and fast one, seeing a number of mantras develop as we shifted our mindset- ‘working walls’, ‘pique interest not Pinterest’, ‘classrooms under the influence’, ‘pretty or pretty useful’, ‘more documenting, less decorating’. These mantras helped us to notice and name what we had discovered through our research. They remind us today about what we now know works harder for learners and learning; co-constructed or learner-made, intentional and useful, voice and documentation. Our walls have the power to tell a story about learners and their learning. they are also a tool for learning, [[The Third Teacher]] in the classroom. "
