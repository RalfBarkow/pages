Thus, structural coupling of social systems does not contribute directly to the reproduction of the systems. It is simply the form in which the system presupposes specific states or changes in its environment and relies on them.\nThe constitution provides an example of structural coupling between the legal and the political systems (Luhmann, 2004, Ch. 10). When constitutions emerged in the eighteenth century, they helped recombine the functionally differentiated political and legal systems. From an autopoietic perspective, constitutions were adopted in response to problems of self-reference, paradoxes, and asymmetries in the legal and the political systems of the respective countries. In the political system constitutions are the mechanisms of self-binding sovereign power. In the legal system it provides the latter with the power to determine the constitutionality of positive law.\n"

Historical Embodiment: A situation in which a history of Structural Coupling is required for a system to count as being embodied.\n1. Physical Embodiment: A situation in which a system requires “physical instantiation” to count as being embodied.\n1. “Organismoid” Embodiment: A situation in which a system requires an organism-like body to count as being embodied.\n1. Organismic Embodiment: A situation in which only (biological) living bodies count as being embodied.\n\nIt should be clear that Structural Coupling is the least restrictive notion of embodiment, whereas Organismic Embodiment is the most restrictive."
