        "text": "The workings of a black box may be studied or inferred by varying the inputs and analyzing the outputs. Some black boxes, such as captured enemy code machines or machines used in electrical engineering applications, are literally black boxes. It is very useful to **regard most living systems and organizations as black boxes** because they cannot be taken apart for study and retain their identity as wholes. Their inputs and outputs can be observed or manipulated and their activities thereby predicted, influenced or directed.\n\n"
