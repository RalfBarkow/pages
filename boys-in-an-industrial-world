This environment didn't provide the [[Psychological Safety]] I needed to thrive in a world that favoured extroverts. My confidence took a battering early at high school in those important foundational years and I found solitude in activities free from judgement."

      "text": "I did play rugby league. Dad had and I suppose I\nfelt this was expected of my brother and me. While I felt loved, I didn't feel like I lived up to his expectations on the field. It was certainly one way I tried to connect to my father, who excelled at sport. I was slow to develop but even when selected at representative level I lacked the type of confidence and aggression needed to succeed in this contact sport. It seems we boys spend our childhood trying to win the approval of our fathers. I now understand fathers spend their later years seeking the confirmation from their children they did a good job of parenting. "

However, when an opportunity to trial in Sydney, for what is one of the Ã©lite franchises in the national competition was presented, my lack of confidence again emerged. It is said it is the things in life you don't do, rather than the things you do, that are the basis for regret. That I didn't have the courage to take a risk and head south to 'the big smoke' is a regret."

I have tried to protect myself from any further shame experienced by not being a learner, and on that high school parade ground by keeping quiet, and to prove myself by [[Armoring Up]] with university qualifications - the lone work of gathering university credits is a private one - and also from promotions. I'm now more confident in my actions, a confidence that experience brings I suppose. I am also driven by a recognition that humanity is facing challenges like never before including climate change, the impact of ubiquitous  technology, international conflict and the growing inequalities on our planet.

Being in the football team carried some kudos and a new confidence emerged for me in the senior secondary years. However, when an opportunity to trial in Sydney, for what is one of the Ã©lite franchises in the national competition was presented, my lack of confidence again emerged. It is said it is the things in life you don't do, rather than the things you do, that are the basis for regret. That I didn't have the courage to take a risk and head south to 'the big smoke' is a regret."

On the first day of secondary school I was punched in the face on assembly in front of hundreds of students in an unprovoked attack by another student. In a state of shock I didn't have the opportunity to defend myself, or even respond in any way. This incident caused me shame and embarrassment, and I withdrew.  I now wonder if I had not been so stunned, and had got a shot back at this fellow student I had not even met, if my path might have been a different one. The idea of [[Sliding Doors]] is compelling."
