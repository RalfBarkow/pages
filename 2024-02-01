      "text": "so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

      "text": "in the 1990s when millions of people went online for the first time ever their experience looked something like this they plugged a telephone line into their computers installed America online from a CD or opened the pre-installed MSN Suite in their Windows version and they were generally greeted by a dashboard like this right away there are options for games a news stand personal finance travel booking Etc every user basically automatically got an email address resulting in this iconic sound you've got and they also got an instant messenger like the yellow running man of AOL or the center of my childhood Obsession MSN Messenger this OneStop shop for all of your needs seemed impossibly convenient at the time they made the internet easier than ever AOL alone quickly gained tens of millions of users and fueled by investor hype they even bought the giant publisher Time Warner which then valued the combined entity at about $360 billion for context there is more than 8 times what Elon paid for Twitter and more than 13 times what Microsoft paid for LinkedIn even ignoring inflation at their PEAK Internet portals like AOL and MSN were basically seen as the whole internet but while young Martin was happily buzzing the windows of his MSN buddies and dads around the world were ecstatic about seeing stock quotes in AOL some idealistic nerds had a really different vision for the future of the internet people like Tim burners Lee were quietly working on something called the worldwide web where any user's computer could connect to any website not just the handful of companies that AOL struck a business development deal with and where the network itself would be fully open and decentralized and to do this HTML was invented as a way to describe the contents of a website in a standardized text file HTTP was invented as a way for a server to then send this text file to a computer that wanted to view their site and programs called web browsers were invented which could then read the file and display the website to the user anyone could make a website anyone could use the protocols and anyone could even make a web browser so the whole thing was permissionless and decentralized and the people in charge of shaping these standards were not companies but instead nonprofits like the worldwide Web Consortium also known as the w3c now for many years the worldwide web was seen as a hopelessly complex and nerdy thing after all how the normal person even know how to find all these random web servers or how could we expect them to learn to use these complex text strings called uniform resource locators just to get around or perhaps just as importantly how could anyone monetize such a decentralized system and if no one could why would anyone bother with putting their valuable stuff up there surely the masses would be more drawn to the closed web portals that were so much simpler to use and yet the open web enthusiasts kept tinkering and of course as we know not too many years later they won in 1990 the first search engine launched making it easy to navigate the decentralized network in 1994 Netscape launched making web browsers really userfriendly soon after the web portals like AOL started including their own web browsers inside their portals then in 1995 Bill Gates announced that Microsoft would jump on the quote internet tidal wave sounding code red and going all in on the worldwide web soon after players like Mozilla and WordPress democratized the open web for anyone who wanted to participate and a Nimble internet native startup called Google quickly took over and built what has basically become the infrastructure of much of the modern internet an incredible search engine a powerful web browser a fantastic free email service that became the default identity for people across most of the internet and even a default way to monetize just about any website just allow them to play some ads on your blog or on your video and you to can make money on this wild thing known as the internet it turns out that the Techno optimists who were so insistent on new standards and protocols and everything else they they were right and they won Innovation and good design made this complex Network super easy to use and its permissionless nature meant that in the place of AOL and MSN we instead got millions of successful websites so the internet became technically decentralized except with time of course companies have found new tools to create wall Gardens even using this infrastructure as well and those new tools are called Network effects and ecosystems and every Tech Giant today is trying to lock you into their W garden with these ecosystems and network effects are incredibly powerful tools and once again they're starting to starve the internet of innovation again but just like back in the '90s there's a new Coalition forming that is aiming to break these wall Gardens again it's a coalition of unlikely seeming enthusiasts again who insist on using protocols like activity Pub and whose plans include building a so-called fediverse a decentralized social internet which will break the walls of the current ecosystems which they think will create a whole second massive wave of innovation and democratization the parallels are very strong with the '90s and it's not just the idealists either Mark Zuckerberg Twitter founder Jack dorsy and the heads of Wordpress Tumblr Flipboard Mozilla and more have all announced embracing some form of this future so that is potentially huge so what the hell is the ferse can it change the whole internet and should we be worried or excited about people like Mark Zuckerberg embracing it let's find out [Music] \nto dig deeper into this topic I interviewed the CEO of Mastadon the CEO of automatic the company that owns Tumblr and WordPress the CEO of open Vibe a client for the fediverse and also two people who run a fairly large Master on instance plus a few others too if this topic ends up fascinating you as much as it fascinated me you can see four of my interviews in full on our streaming service nebula with links in the description thanks to nebula for sponsoring this video have you ever tried to convince somebody to move from from One messaging app to another and met just almost complete insurmountable resistance well in that case you have met the power of the network effect each user already has their Network in a certain app including their past conversations files Etc and giving all of that up is just incredibly hard there's a literal mathematical formula attached to something called the mattal law that states that a network becomes exponentially more valuable as more people join and get connected to it this means that large networks tend to just keep getting larger and that moving people over to a competitor becomes incredibly hard even if that competitor is objectively better for everyone involved which allows big networks to either entify their platform and cram it full of ads or to extort a sort of tax on all the participants or both because good luck moving all of your networks somewhere else even worse if you're stuck with one network a company can then try to use that to force or at least nudge you to use the rest of their ecosystem to creating an Ever stronger dependence for you and gigantic World Gardens that become basically impossible to compete with from the outside think IM message slowly bringing people into the Apple ecosystem whether they want to use an iPhone or not think left leaning Twitter users struggling to leave the platform even if they disagree with Elon musk's decisions think right leaning Twitter users struggling to establish a competing platform after Trump and Alex Jones and a bunch of other people were booted off Etc Network effects are one of the biggest reasons for why people are stuck in their walled Gardens and breaking the effects is one of the main goals of the fediverse and their tool in particular is basically the same thing that it was back in the open web days protocols most prominently a protocol named activity pup and here's how this one works every social media platform if you think about it basically has the same elements like profile names pictures and posts and the same interactions too like likes boosts Etc just displayed a little bit differently so under activity Pub all social media platforms agreed to a shared standard for how to to handle these elements which suddenly makes these systems interoperable and activity Pub is actually a proper standard that is defined and maintained by the same w3c as HTTP and you can see it in action already today its first users were services like Mastadon pixel fan peer tube Etc these are somewhat Niche and nerdy things with a limited appeal at least for now which mostly act as activity PP based clones or at least versions of one of the existing big platforms but since they're all using activity pop they actually have two really important character characteristics first they are decentralized instead of a single company owning Twitter Instagram Etc these new platforms have basically no owners anyone can run an instance on them in the same way that anyone can host their email server and these instances can then just talk to each other to form a shared network in fact you can see in a user's name what instance they are from in the same way that you can see whether somebody uses Gmail or Outlook or whatever else as their email provider and it's not uncommon for large organizations like the BBC to actually host their own instances for their employees too just like with email users can more or less move their accounts between instances and even move their followers along if they don't like how their instance is run and also anyone can build a client to access this shared network just like anyone can build an email client too there are dozens of different apps like this with my personal favorite being Megalodon on Android and there also over 10,000 instances just for madon already too and the second unique characteristic is that anything on activity Pub is actually operable tool a Mastadon post a pixel fat post or a peer to video are all equivalent objects using the activity pop standard so each of these can be accessed from either of the apps so here's me in Mastadon seeing a pixel fed image for example which I can like and comment on using my masteron account which will also show up when viewed in pixel fat 2 and similarly here is a peer tube video including its full comment section viewed in the masteron app which I can fully interact with too now interoperability can become a little bit weird between very different types of apps and content but overall what this shared standard creates is one giant shared network between all the different apps which is what people call the fediverse well that is a terribly nerdy name and it also just seems like a really complex system but I guess the open internet seemed really complex as well until we got used to it and just like the open internet the commercial players are starting to pay attention to the fediverse now too meta has explicitly committed to adopting activity pop for Threads in the future and Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly personally pushing for Federation Flipboard has already rolled out experimental activity pop support so you can see masteron posts in the Flipboard app for example and the other way around too and the Flipboard CEO has a whole podcast dedicated to the fediverse now too then Jack dorsy was working on having all of Twitter become Federated before Elon took over although since then he has moved his project over to his new platform called to Blue Sky Mozilla Vivaldi medium and more are all hosting their own masteron instances Mozilla has invested into Mammoth an activity Pub client that wants to make using the fediverse more userfriendly and automatic has embraced activity Pub as well they have already rolled out experimental support for WordPress the CEO Matt muan wake has confirmed to me that they are still working on getting Tumblr support as well and when I asked if the podcast player pocketcasts which they also own could add support as well Matt said that it was definitely possible later on so there's definitely a lot of interest Beyond just the early adopter techno idealists here already now notably missing from this for now of course are the really big platforms Facebook Instagram Tik Tok YouTube Etc and the current Integrations are actually still pretty limited Blue Sky the new project of Jack dorsy uses something called the at protocol which is competing with activity Pub and not really compatible with it for now for Threads the tests have just started and for now only a few individual thread posts are actually visible through Mastadon in WordPress blog owners have to get an extra plugin and turn Federation on manually and this then allows them their blocks to be viewed through apps like Mastadon in full and CEO Matt millwick tells me that only a few thousand people have used this so far and from what I hear tumbller and threads will both at least initially require users to opt in to having their posts Federated meta and automatic in particular are really large companies under a lot of scrutiny so they are really careful with exposing user data to outside platforms and letting outside data come into their platform especially from people who haven't actually signed their terms of service agreements so there's a whole lot of work to be figured out still not long ago Facebook got lots of backlash around things like Cambridge analytica when they exposed a lot of user data through the Facebook API and so they're likely extra cautious in this new world of the Federated internet all of this will take time but when people like Mark Zuckerberg and Jack dorsy and more are openly saying that this kind of looks like at least some part of the future of social media going forward I think we have to pay a lot of attention and specifically we have to answer two main questions first why would people like this support a new standard a new opening up of the internet that might break their very own walled Gardens and second will all of this work let's start with the why reason number one for why people like Mark Zuckerberg might support such an opening up is that they feel like they might be forced to Regulators around the world are increasingly focused on forcing interoperability the European Union's digital markets act explicitly says that large platforms that they call Gatekeepers have to allow third parties to interoperate with the gatekeeper's own services and meanwhile antitrust laws and regulations are gaining Steam from the likes of the United States Japan Korea Etc we've seen governments attacking everything from Chargers to App Store payments and iMessage monopolies and there's a good chance that if an open standard for social media exists that might soon become kind of mandatory in parts of the world too so adopting interoperability for a relatively new platform like threads might let meta learn experiment and also potentially influence the standard before they're actually forced to do so with their bigger platforms now reason number two for this acceptance is that companies like meta and Twitter actually kind of hate all their moderation options right now moderating A centralized platform is actually not only insanely expensive with tens of thousands of moderators needed but it also comes with an infinite number of controversial decisions that have to be made should Alex Jones or Donald Trump or whoever else be banned it's literally up to you dear Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk and no matter how you choose politicians will drag you to court users and advertisers will hate you Etc but in the Federated system a platform could kick out a user that was bad for business because the people who got kicked out could still just go to another server or start their own and they could even move their followers over if they wanted to it's kind of hard to be angry at that and reason number three is that the network effect that until now worked against Innovation is starting to work for the fediverse too and it's kind of creates a Snowball Effect when the fediverse consisted of just a few Mastadon instances it was basically irrelevant now now that it has over 10 million registered accounts and tens of thousands of instances across many apps it's actually kind of a thing and if even a few of these medium-sized platforms like Tumblr and threads join it will start to rival even the large platforms I mean by now well over 40% of websites on the Internet run on WordPress and pocketcasts could open up basically the entire podcasting industry to the fediverse 2o so while things could happen pretty soon now I have no idea how far away we are from the fediverse becoming a really big thing maybe it will never happened but basically every time a new platform joins the fediverse that shared network grows bigger that makes it more attractive for the next platform to join and so on and so forth so this could spiral into something where a user might think hey why wouldn't I want to join that the shared network instead of one of the W Gardens masteron CEO confirmed to me that this was one of his big hopes and I bet that people like Zuckerberg at least realized this Dynamic too okay reason number four for this interest is that the feder is currently being a little a little bit too technical a little bit too complex and hard to navigate well it's actually not just a bad thing but also an opportunity just like Google and companies like it built the easy to ouse tools and services that made using the open web really userfriendly Zuckerberg might think that they could do the same for the fediverse the most userfriendly app some Central spam filter Discovery algorithms monetization Etc these are all things that meta knows how to build so why not build it for everyone in the same way that Google ads for example work across website and the entire internet users from other fediverse platforms could start using the Technologies and solutions of meta as well meaning that meta could at least attempt to shape social media Beyond just its own wall Gardens too okay and reason number five and this is kind of the Sinister one is that meta might be trying to torpedo this whole thing before it gets big many Open Standards like xmpp or RSS were first embraced by Tech giants like meta and Google just to then be sabotaged from the inside out and then let to die so they might do the same here too maybe meta will do what Apple does with imassage they adopt activity Pub as a standard but then they become its biggest player and they make it so everyone else outside of threads becomes kind of a green bubble a second class citizen to threads so people just end up moving their accounts to threads anyway and the open Alternatives basically just slowly die so these are the five reasons I could come up with for why a company like meta would want to adopt activity pop and regardless of which one ends up being correct like maybe it's a combination of the five as well anyway I actually think there's good reason to believe that the activity PP protocol and the fediverse will succeed regardless the fediverse allows for permissionless innovation in the same way that the early open web did as well for the first time ever a college kid right now can build the next big social app and start with a total addressable user base of at least a few million accounts and indeed the Indie developers are already coming up with creative ideas or a big company like Google who has desperately tried to have its own social media app can soon try again too that is just an incredibly powerful place to be okay so those are all the reasons why I believe this could work but let me throw some cold water on all of these hopes and actually also say why I think it also could fail first all of this ferse thing might just be too Technical and too complex for regular users I mean I personally think that you can get used to this pretty easily but today's world Gardens are very slick and very easy to use so a Federated solution will have a harder time than ever second regular people clearly don't care about Federation until can actually solve a problem of theirs and many people might not want Federation at all I've actually talked to Tumblr users for example who thought that it was quote awful and a terrible idea to let people from outside of Tumblr in as that would break the place's unique culture while masteron die hards often want to block threads on a domain level from federating with their instance altogether because they just don't like the company Matt Milan Wick as a head of Tumblr said that he thought that protocols should support talking to basically anyone and that the users should then be given a choice whether they want to Federate or not which is basically what I think as well but many people clearly just don't want some services to be connected and next moderation could become a problem as the overall Network scales so right now each instance moderates itself they can either block individual accounts or they can also block entire instances this works great right now because you can choose to have for example a very left leaning instance or a very right leaning one or anything else in between or outside where you can even start your own anyway while there are shared block lists and people are working on improving the automation systems and while in my experience masteron content is actually extremely high quality and very wholesome I'm not actually sure how it will scale I had a very good conversation with some people who run a medium-sized masteron instance with four volunteer moderators and a legal counselor and these people sounded very well prepared and just genuinely lovely but I cannot imagine that the average random person hosting an instance would get this detailed and would be this well prepared to handle I don't know large spam attacks or dmca takedown requests or any other number of things so that could become a problem and on the related note one final reason for why I think the activity pop system will be bit challenging in the future is that it does really weird things to content ownership and control see in a centralized platform like for example YouTube the creator of a piece of content can choose what happens with that content I can delete or unlist the video I can block others from re-uploading it Etc similarly abusive content should at least theoretically be removable from the central Authority tool now people can of course misuse these systems and they can break the terms of service agreements but this is still a system that generally does work but in the ferse things get really complicated every post and also the media attached to it generally gets copied to every instance a server that it gets viewed from meaning that a piece of content is often on thousands of servers at the same time"

        "text": "uh these are all here you know we'll share resources afterwards you can copy this and kind of like make it your own but i want to tell you that like this is not like the be all and all the perfect system as it stands on the slide they're meant to be toyed around with tinkered and personalized okay so north is whatever is upstream um west is what reinforces this idea what is similar to this idea south is what exists downstream of the idea and where can this idea lead to um east is sort of opposite of west in that instead of reinforcing it it's transforming the idea so what competes with x what is the opposite of x but also what could supercharge x and make it 10 times better 100 times better so think of these as conversation starters for engaging with an idea and now this is what both vicky and i have found is that using the structure of the compass we're able to gain more clarity into how we should be thinking about uh the the zettlecasting method um and we're less lost we're less wondering like is this is this the right thing we feel like we're gaining traction when we're working with our notes and that is incredibly exciting so um we have planned for you a uh live session where we're gonna do some crowd-sourced uh ideation uh and we're going to use the idea compass together but before that we thought it would be useful for you to see how we have used it in our systems so with my notes or let me roll back a bit um the first the purpose for my notes so the reason why i take notes is that previously i struggled a lot with um i would have the same ideas pop up again and again and i would never write them down and i would never work on them and so um but as anyone uh you know is anyone who thinks they have a good idea i thought my ideas were really good but i just never wrote them down and like tried to work with them um however now the first thing i do is i'm i'm looking for ideas uh and i think just to give a little bit of context i said i was working in urban planning what i'm trying to understand this is my research question um what i'm trying to understand is how cities provide so much value to to us to humans um and and like there's some parts of cities that provide like way more value than other parts yet even though we're able to measure that it's hard for us to replicate those successful parts like why is it so hard for us to do that and we there's a lot of fighting in cities and competition for resources for land etc how land should be used i'm trying to understand that and map that out in my note-taking so using it to hunt for good ideas and also understand how those ideas fit together so when we look at the zelda-casting method and i have to admit i don't implement it quite as truly as it was uh done by nicholas lumen but i do have input on digest and i do use the compass to identify a shiny idea uh and i also use the compass to organize my ideas so here is an example of this um the other day i came across a video and christopher alexander who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually program that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

        "text": "okay so north is whatever is upstream um west is what reinforces this idea what is similar to this idea south is what exists downstream of the idea and where can this idea lead to um east is sort of opposite of west in that instead of reinforcing it it's transforming the idea so what competes with x what is the opposite of x but also what could supercharge x and make it 10 times better 100 times better so think of these as conversation starters for engaging with an idea and now this is what both vicky and i have found is that using the structure of the compass we're able to gain more clarity into how we should be thinking about uh the the zettlecasting method um and we're less lost we're less wondering like is this is this the right thing we feel like we're gaining traction when we're working with our notes and that is incredibly exciting so um we have planned for you a uh live session where we're gonna do some crowd-sourced uh ideation uh and we're going to use the idea compass together but before that we thought it would be useful for you to see how we have used it in our systems so with my notes or let me roll back a bit um the first the purpose for my notes so the reason why i take notes is that previously i struggled a lot with um i would have the same ideas pop up again and again and i would never write them down and i would never work on them and so um but as anyone uh you know is anyone who thinks they have a good idea i thought my ideas were really good but i just never wrote them down and like tried to work with them um however now the first thing i do is i'm i'm looking for ideas uh and i think just to give a little bit of context i said i was working in urban planning what i'm trying to understand this is my research question um what i'm trying to understand is how cities provide so much value to to us to humans um and and like there's some parts of cities that provide like way more value than other parts yet even though we're able to measure that it's hard for us to replicate those successful parts like why is it so hard for us to do that and we there's a lot of fighting in cities and competition for resources for land etc how land should be used i'm trying to understand that and map that out in my note-taking so using it to hunt for good ideas and also understand how those ideas fit together so when we look at the zelda-casting method and i have to admit i don't implement it quite as truly as it was uh done by nicholas lumen but i do have input on digest and i do use the compass to identify a shiny idea uh and i also use the compass to organize my ideas so here is an example of this um the other day i came across a video and christopher alexander who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually program that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what

[Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions

existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i

notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

        "text": "west is what reinforces this idea what is similar to this idea south is what exists downstream of the idea and where can this idea lead to um east is sort of opposite of west in that instead of reinforcing it it's transforming the idea so what competes with x what is the opposite of x but also what could supercharge x and make it 10 times better 100 times better so think of these as conversation starters for engaging with an idea and now this is what both vicky and i have found is that using the structure of the compass we're able to gain more clarity into how we should be thinking about uh the the zettlecasting method um and we're less lost we're less wondering like is this is this the right thing we feel like we're gaining traction when we're working with our notes and that is incredibly exciting so um we have planned for you a uh live session where we're gonna do some crowd-sourced uh ideation uh and we're going to use the idea compass together but before that we thought it would be useful for you to see how we have used it in our systems so with my notes or let me roll back a bit um the first the purpose for my notes so the reason why i take notes is that previously i struggled a lot with um i would have the same ideas pop up again and again and i would never write them down and i would never work on them and so um but as anyone uh you know is anyone who thinks they have a good idea i thought my ideas were really good but i just never wrote them down and like tried to work with them um however now the first thing i do is i'm i'm looking for ideas uh and i think just to give a little bit of context i said i was working in urban planning what i'm trying to understand this is my research question um what i'm trying to understand is how cities provide so much value to to us to humans um and and like there's some parts of cities that provide like way more value than other parts yet even though we're able to measure that it's hard for us to replicate those successful parts like why is it so hard for us to do that and we there's a lot of fighting in cities and competition for resources for land etc how land should be used i'm trying to understand that and map that out in my note-taking so using it to hunt for good ideas and also understand how those ideas fit together so when we look at the zelda-casting method and i have to admit i don't implement it quite as truly as it was uh done by nicholas lumen but i do have input on digest and i do use the compass to identify a shiny idea uh and i also use the compass to organize my ideas so here is an example of this um the other day i came across a video and christopher alexander who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually program that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you

you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of

custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler

conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

        "text": "um east is sort of opposite of west in that instead of reinforcing it it's transforming the idea so what competes with x what is the opposite of x but also what could supercharge x and make it 10 times better 100 times better so think of these as conversation starters for engaging with an idea and now this is what both vicky and i have found is that using the structure of the compass we're able to gain more clarity into how we should be thinking about uh the the zettlecasting method um and we're less lost we're less wondering like is this is this the right thing we feel like we're gaining traction when we're working with our notes and that is incredibly exciting so um we have planned for you a uh live session where we're gonna do some crowd-sourced uh ideation uh and we're going to use the idea compass together but before that we thought it would be useful for you to see how we have used it in our systems so with my notes or let me roll back a bit um the first the purpose for my notes so the reason why i take notes is that previously i struggled a lot with um i would have the same ideas pop up again and again and i would never write them down and i would never work on them and so um but as anyone uh you know is anyone who thinks they have a good idea i thought my ideas were really good but i just never wrote them down and like tried to work with them um however now the first thing i do is i'm i'm looking for ideas uh and i think just to give a little bit of context i said i was working in urban planning what i'm trying to understand this is my research question um what i'm trying to understand is how cities provide so much value to to us to humans um and and like there's some parts of cities that provide like way more value than other parts yet even though we're able to measure that it's hard for us to replicate those successful parts like why is it so hard for us to do that and we there's a lot of fighting in cities and competition for resources for land etc how land should be used i'm trying to understand that and map that out in my note-taking so using it to hunt for good ideas and also understand how those ideas fit together so when we look at the zelda-casting method and i have to admit i don't implement it quite as truly as it was uh done by nicholas lumen but i do have input on digest and i do use the compass to identify a shiny idea uh and i also use the compass to organize my ideas so here is an example of this um the other day i came across a video and christopher alexander who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually program that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

        "text": "so think of these as conversation starters for engaging with an idea and now this is what both vicky and i have found is that using the structure of the compass we're able to gain more clarity into how we should be thinking about uh the the zettlecasting method um and we're less lost we're less wondering like is this is this the right thing we feel like we're gaining traction when we're working with our notes and that is incredibly exciting so um we have planned for you a uh live session where we're gonna do some crowd-sourced uh ideation uh and we're going to use the idea compass together but before that we thought it would be useful for you to see how we have used it in our systems so with my notes or let me roll back a bit um the first the purpose for my notes so the reason why i take notes is that previously i struggled a lot with um i would have the same ideas pop up again and again and i would never write them down and i would never work on them and so um but as anyone uh you know is anyone who thinks they have a good idea i thought my ideas were really good but i just never wrote them down and like tried to work with them um however now the first thing i do is i'm i'm looking for ideas uh and i think just to give a little bit of context i said i was working in urban planning what i'm trying to understand this is my research question um what i'm trying to understand is how cities provide so much value to to us to humans um and and like there's some parts of cities that provide like way more value than other parts yet even though we're able to measure that it's hard for us to replicate those successful parts like why is it so hard for us to do that and we there's a lot of fighting in cities and competition for resources for land etc how land should be used i'm trying to understand that and map that out in my note-taking so using it to hunt for good ideas and also understand how those ideas fit together so when we look at the zelda-casting method and i have to admit i don't implement it quite as truly as it was uh done by nicholas lumen but i do have input on digest and i do use the compass to identify a shiny idea uh and i also use the compass to organize my ideas so here is an example of this um the other day i came across a video and christopher alexander who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually program that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you

within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

        "text": "so um we have planned for you a uh live session where we're gonna do some crowd-sourced uh ideation uh and we're going to use the idea compass together but before that we thought it would be useful for you to see how we have used it in our systems so with my notes or let me roll back a bit um the first the purpose for my notes so the reason why i take notes is that previously i struggled a lot with um i would have the same ideas pop up again and again and i would never write them down and i would never work on them and so um but as anyone uh you know is anyone who thinks they have a good idea i thought my ideas were really good but i just never wrote them down and like tried to work with them um however now the first thing i do is i'm i'm looking for ideas uh and i think just to give a little bit of context i said i was working in urban planning what i'm trying to understand this is my research question um what i'm trying to understand is how cities provide so much value to to us to humans um and and like there's some parts of cities that provide like way more value than other parts yet even though we're able to measure that it's hard for us to replicate those successful parts like why is it so hard for us to do that and we there's a lot of fighting in cities and competition for resources for land etc how land should be used i'm trying to understand that and map that out in my note-taking so using it to hunt for good ideas and also understand how those ideas fit together so when we look at the zelda-casting method and i have to admit i don't implement it quite as truly as it was uh done by nicholas lumen but i do have input on digest and i do use the compass to identify a shiny idea uh and i also use the compass to organize my ideas so here is an example of this um the other day i came across a video and christopher alexander who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually program that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh

sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that

do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or

make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler

use the compass to identify a shiny idea uh and i also use the compass to organize my ideas so here is an example of this um the other day i came across a video and christopher alexander who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually program that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

how cities provide so much value to to us to humans um and and like there's some parts of cities that provide like way more value than other parts yet even though we're able to measure that it's hard for us to replicate those successful parts like why is it so hard for us to do that and we there's a lot of fighting in cities and competition for resources for land etc how land should be used i'm trying to understand that and map that out in my note-taking so using it to hunt for good ideas and also understand how those ideas fit together so when we look at the zelda-casting method and i have

we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

        "text": "so using it to hunt for good ideas and also understand how those ideas fit together so when we look at the zelda-casting method and i have to admit i don't implement it quite as truly as it was uh done by nicholas lumen but i do have input on digest and i do use the compass to identify a shiny idea uh and i also use the compass to organize my ideas so here is an example of this um the other day i came across a video and christopher alexander who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually program that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like

a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering

reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i

        "text": "so using it to hunt for good ideas and also understand how those ideas fit together so when we look at the zettelkasten method and i have to admit i don't implement it quite as truly as it was uh done by nicholas lumen but i do have input on digest and i do use the compass to identify a shiny idea uh and i also use the compass to organize my ideas so here is an example of this um the other day i came across a video and christopher alexander who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually program that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

        "text": "so using it to hunt for good ideas and also understand how those ideas fit together so when we look at the zettelkasten method and i have to admit i don't implement it quite as truly as it was uh done by [[Niklas Luhmann]] but i do have input on digest and i do use the compass to identify a shiny idea uh and i also use the compass to organize my ideas so here is an example of this um the other day i came across a video and christopher alexander who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually program that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this

fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

        "text": "the other day i came across a video and [[Christopher Alexander]] who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually program that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i

definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

        "text": "the other day i came across a video and [[Christopher Alexander]] who's a famous who was a famous um uh urbanist had written a huge uh hugely famous book called a pattern language influential both in urbanism and in computation um i took notes on his talk and i want to illustrate two things here on this slide one is that i used the idea compass to have a conversation with myself about uh what he was positing and from what he was saying i also was able to distill and pull out this one single idea that i thought was like so shiny and it goes like this defining the value of intangible things is one of our greatest challenges i believe this so much it's like we we love seeing beautiful things yet it's so hard to actually [[program]] that and make space for that in our cities because everything gets boiled down to something really functional or value engineered as they call it and the interesting thing here is that i don't remember if i found the idea first and then had a conversation with myself or if i had a conversation with myself and then found the idea and crafted the idea from that which is why i have the chicken and egg emoji there like over time it's it's literally a conversation with yourself that you're having on the page and then once i've identified ideas we got to make sure we don't lose these ideas because if i don't save it somewhere i'm not going to find it again and so i have one page where i save all ideas that i find and it doesn't matter what kind of idea it is it just always goes in here and i have found that the way the place i fail the most is when i have overly admin heavy uh organizations so like if i have metadata or if i have to put it in a folder a specific folder or if i have to give it a specific like name like those things really bogged me down and so early stages when i had an empty index file i would probably file this idea under values okay something really simple and broad and even in the index file or slash moc hat tip to nick um i have conversations with myself there too that is more concentrated to concerning values so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into

phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back

reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping

from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said right like if we don't record it we lose it and even when we record it we need to be able to find them in the right time then the next one is newsletter so i hashtag or hashtag i tag my notes based on whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very different way of living life uh and then i went north in towards the end to mention the point of you know why do we what what are we living for and for me part of it is about living for connections and very strangely it can come from a foreign place it can come with a foreign place with strangers that you don't even know and yet you can feel a connection with them um but in this piece itself uh i say okay this is for another time and for me creating output and answering big questions is so difficult that i want to be able to give myself permission to not do it all at once and that was a block for me in terms of you know writing or creating youtube videos i felt like i need to give the complete answer but by using this method uh it was really easy to just take a small chunk of everything that's there and being able to move on and then the last one is south uh which is you know what comes what what idea does this lead to and i just threw out a call to action prompting others um to share their unexpected places of connection and get the conversation going because another idea which we won't talk about in this presentation is also ideas come from conversations and we can help each other build on ideas and so that's something i've done so the process is different from face and you can see how versatile the compass can be and you can adapt it to your use so let's get to you trying it out okay so everyone get ready because we are going to be asking for your participation to help us build out an idea and the idea we're gonna practice on today is writing is thinking on paper so is anyone surprised how do we feel how do we feel about uh this this idea so that we will try to you know go in all four directions faye will be jotting down all all the ideas you have and we'll see where this takes us you know what kind of connections can we make because the one of the other points we want to get across is you already have a lot of ideas in your head or your obsidian or whatever tool you're using and let's try to make some connections so how about which direction do we want to go first let's go um let's go west first so what is similar to this idea you know writing is thinking on paper i think we already got some suggestions here thinking at the keyboard so it's sort of like using the digital medium yeah um over the paper medium and i'm going to be put just oops oops nope nope helps if i don't have caps on oh nick's walking is thinking on the ground okay andy clark's example about the external loop of pen and paper is the process of thinking about complex ideas i love that making the distinction and that writing helps us do more complex thinking i'm just gonna copy some of these that stand out because i actually i'm not sure if i can find quickly the ones that you're reading out but writing is re writing is rethinking i love this one as well oh yeah we've thought once yeah now we're writing to rehash the idea yeah clarifies the thinking yep talking through with your dog yeah could also be on a walk at the same time yeah rubber duckies to process thoughts someone else also shared this idea with me the other day which i really liked okay so we've got already a bunch of great ideas um [Music] particularly excellent i wish i could put all of these i know i'm like off the page but yes let's add one more the articulation writing forces you to articulate your thoughts that's also okay all right okay so here we go in a few seconds already we're making a lot of connections okay then how about we go north oh sorry yeah yeah i know my directions so north alright this is upstream where does this idea come from what is the theme or what is the question that is trying to answer what are the origins what belief does this idea support what causes this the domain why right yeah externalizing thought is how we think despair read them out i'll try to type them journaling okay um analog versus digital interesting one wanting people to know we existed interesting questions memoir style no taking of course questioning yourself before you commit questioning oh i like that okay question writing yeah record keeping [Music] the evolution from talking to writing okay okay oral histories to written history not everyone can be a bard yep conversation with self that's also an interesting one right we it it's a communication tool not only externally but internally materializing fault okay absolutely we have so many okay this is great yeah everyone's going to be so good at using the idea compass yeah i think we have already got [Laughter] dealing with existentialism okay all right has it really happened yeah right oh danny damn we're getting really deep so deep okay all right now then why don't we go east let's let's challenge this view a little bit right what competes with this idea or what's opposite of writing is thinking well i don't know if that's a good what's missing and i think some of them we can actually move from west of you know adding visuals for example is you know complementing writing is thinking walking is also a compliment what's the disadvantage feedback yeah right processing emotion writing is processing emotion i find that very interesting right thinking and emotions they are different things or i mean i don't know question lack of structure yeah that's definitely true i wrote down excludes opinions of other people on side scroll here's one from tao da jing talking is a finger pointing at the moon okay you'll have to expand on that tony communication fog yes that's true i experience that all the time assumptions reality yes uh i saw one writing without thinking but that's nice yeah that's fascinating so that's more like you know journaling or brained out that's i'm getting so excited there's so many good ideas yeah okay okay let's add that one and then let's move on what was the last one noise versus signal that's definitely something i've struggled with as well okay great um now let's go downstream south right so having all of this in mind where does this lead to right how can we what does writing is thinking contribute to um what does this nurture you know maybe it's liberal arts right that there is a stronger case for writing um let's see communication toolbox [Music] history mental models someone mentioned writer passage tolerance and awareness yep wisdom creation yes wisdom creation wow writing to persuade yeah okay this leads to culture absolutely yeah learn in public uh self-awareness self-awareness yes change yeah this leads to change knowing thyself yeah rethinking time travel yeah it helps you time travel damn yeah this is unexpected yeah it can contribute to social justice movements yeah better opinion of yourself you're not as stupid and dumb as you might you maybe you maybe you might account true i mean sometimes i look at my writing like okay this looks good it doesn't seem to map to what was going on in the head empathy okay i think i think this has definitely demonstrated that the idea compass people can use this you can use this you've you've demonstrated competency and i've seen so many wonderful ideas here ideas that i wouldn't even have thought about myself ever and this is why doing this uh crowdsourcing this is um really interesting because you're getting a much fuller view of the idea than doing this on your own so not just saying that you shouldn't do it on your own it is still useful but uh yeah this this definitely supercharged it for sure and of course the chat is saved and i think depending on how and when i look at this this immediately as a visual thinker i would have then taken this made it into a mind map and shared it with other people and i think i can get my ideas or generate more ideas so much easier so you know we're in that divergent phase of ideation and once you're in that output phase when you converge uh having this in front of you uh will be so helpful and it helps you see unexpected connections within the ideas that you've come up with as well mm-hmm so vicky i'm wondering if you should stop here and yeah to q a uh because we are at 53 minutes it sounds good sounds good nice welcome back yeah happy i've been here the whole time just hiding in in the bushes uh i'm back just want to give you a physical round of applause and if people can give a round of applause in the chat as well this has been awesome so far we won't be able to cover all the questions we'll get a couple in but then um something that dan posted is that we can continue the conversation if people can ping you probably on twitter and this is probably a good time just to talk about where people can reach you reach you both that's right yeah let's get to that oh and i do see a few links so after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use it that is that's all yeah that is all yeah so yeah this is where you can reach us um and i think stuff will be posted in the chat as well so that'll be easier um an easier place to get this information but yeah uh nick have you had a chance to take a look at the q a is there anything that stood out to you that we should address yeah i was trying to see if there were some easy wins uh some quick ones the one with the most votes comes from danny i'm not sure if it's going to be an easy answer but i will pose it to you both do you suggest atomic notes for linking or larger notes and why uh maybe i'll start so for me there's a place for both depending on what you're trying to achieve so for atomic nodes uh i like them for idea exploration so we start with a very simple idea and we go in different directions with the compass for example and it's more difficult to go with a bigger document because then you get lost um in the complexity of it but having something like a mock that links to other ideas so that you have one definitive place to come back to and understand and visually see all the ideas lined up i think that's also very useful so for me that would be how i would use a different use case for each um i have a very short answer to this i typically use very very small atomic notes and i link them together in my moc or index and that's how i create connections and so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

        "text": "so there you have it this is how i have implemented the uh the idea compass and next up is vicky all right so um i think as you can see with phase example already by thinking about thinking about the notes in the in the compass way or by taking notes in the compass way it shapes how you think and you're almost actively trying to make connections and already a mix is easier and the why i say that is because for me uh my pain point while i definitely share some of the ones that fey already mentioned for me it's to start answering big questions but being able to share and articulate the answers in progress because for me it just feels like it's so overwhelming to answer big like questions that i need to start making sense in small ways and so with that in mind i'll share with you my process which is actually a little bit different from face and that's one of the ideas we want to get across is that you can definitely adapt the compass to how you're using this so on the next slide i my input digest organizer outline i use the compass in the digest and in the outlying phase so uh let me show you an example i write the intersectional thinking newsletter every week and so for inputs uh they usually start from a fleeting note from a thought i had um so one of the recent ones articles i wrote started from sitting in a land rover on safari thinking about waking up every single day at 5 00 am and how that's not a vacation i need a vacation after i get home because this 5 a.m schedule is really tough so it starts just you know like a random observation then when i go to the digest phase i start you know having a conversation with my with myself just like faith and i'm asking myself questions like what what is interesting here and for me contrast is definitely one of the things i want to focus on uh and for me it was normal life versus travel like these seems to be you know two different parts of our lives but i realize that what's why they're opposite is because we assume that you know when we're when we're traveling we're relaxing we're switching off but actually travel doesn't mean that there's a connection there between travel and normal life um and we might feel more alive while traveling than living at home which is really strange right we should be living most of our life and yet sometimes it feels like we're just walking zombies uh going about our day most times and so it made me ask more questions have more conversations with myself as to you know what do we live for okay it's a really big question right one i cannot possibly give the answer for but i make a new note from this question because this is the north question right this is why am i even interested in travel and in living and in the idea of switching off and you know living in the first place so i use the compass to guide my thinking and uh here a point i want to bring out uh is both faye and i experience this is that you don't have to use the compass in all directions all the time for me for this uh idea specifically going east is all i needed i was already excited about this idea i wanted to dig deeper so i didn't even have the time to go in other directions and that's totally okay right every idea it's not always going to have the equal number of ideas generated in all sorts of directions okay so now we move on to organize i actually don't i'm not an organized organization genius like faye is for me uh my system is really basic i just use tags i just that's my actual note that i wrote down and i just tag them for when i want to resurface when i i want to revisit these ideas so one is i hashtag it anecdote um because i find when i'm creating output i want to add stories into them so what i do is in my obsidian if i'm writing and i want a story i type i look at my anecdote tag and i filter them the next one is build this one is for a reminder for myself it's almost like assigning myself a task of i want to build on this idea over time i don't have to do it now um but it's a reminder for self so i when i'm ready and i'm in the you know the headspace of wanting to work on an idea i can because similar to what fay said

whether this idea is one for just a tweet or one for a newsletter or one for youtube video and those help me create output and so for me the compass really is a tool in assisting creative output so let's talk about the output where i in my output itself i want to share the fun of stretching an idea in different directions kind of like shh bring people to that that strange place and show them around so in this p in this post i i did i went both west and yeast contrasting daily routine on safari versus at home so for example um i talk about there is a time where we read the news in the morning and you know reading the news at home is just i don't know you're on your phone or you're reading a physical paper but on safari reading the news is looking at tracks on the ground animal tracks because it tells you what happened last night you know the lions are walking in towards the east right the the lepers had a kill because there was a drag mark on the front floor so it's a very

after all those applause come in you can hear them clapping in the digital interwebs we do have a few places it looks like um links but there's the twitter profiles there's the at one for vicky and this this one's coming in for faye it's in the chat make sure you don't lose that with all the clapping [Laughter] thanks everyone it's been tremendous i you guys have made it such an enjoyable session yeah i think i have 10 ideas i can start writing posts on just from this five minutes of ideation so i hope you if you're interested in creating you know like output as well that this game gave you something to work on yeah and as we've been trying to emphasize throughout the entire session take this tool make it your own there's no wrong or right like just any like if it helps you use

so i make the connections very lightweight but meaningful so i add a description to each link like it's not just like a backlink or something i make myself uh create value in that connection before i uh forge the connection between the two notes because making connections and notes and apps is so easy you can almost overdo it just like you can overdo collecting uh things or clipping things from the web uh and so i i gave myself a bit more friction when creating links i do not have experience linking larger notes so i can't really speak to that i think that is a pretty excellent answer not just for danny's question but the other one that had the most upvotes how on earth do you connect notes together and you sort of both answered a little bit of like a map of content sort of you know compile links and then another also small notes intentionally explaining how they're linked together yeah and you saw vicky's method that used the hashtags like you can use hashtags to link ideas together as well if they have a certain theme or if they're linked to you know if you have a more of like a workflow that you're going through or a destination where you want to spend an idea hashtag uh a newsletter and then when you hit the newsletter tag you see all your newsletter ideas so that's you know one different way of doing links than just straight up links yes okay well any final thoughts before i uh give one more wrap up i want everyone to look one more time in the chat where da dan has successfully reposted those links where you can easily click the url and jump into vicky and faye's youtube website newsletter sub stack and twitter um respectively and i definitely encourage you to do those but yeah any last words oh i have i wish this was a longer session please i know we didn't answer um most of the questions so feel free to send faye and i um questions in the dm on twitter or reach out wherever um yeah i mean this is this has been so fun hopefully you guys same i echo vicky's sentiments uh i'm like i'm thrilled with how the session went it was exciting there was a lot of amazing energy and compiling and crowdsourcing those notes together was incredibly fun uh i wanted to there's there's one question in the q a that i just want to highlight from christopher how do you make it not feel like you're spending all your time managing yourself faster than like project management honestly that's one of that was one of my key pain points using and trying to implement zelda custom method and the way i've done it i've just i've stripped all admin and overhead from my method and some of you guys noticed i'm using logsage as my note-taking and specifically for settler costume and i use the indents to create hierarchy between different ideas and just hitting tab to create hierarchy is so lightweight it's so easy you don't have to like connect them in different ways they have implicit hierarchy just by moving the dots and the bullets around and i found that to be one of the things that was so helpful to lessening the overhead on maintaining this but there are more parts to the system that i'm completely glossing over and not describing so but that's one of the important ones thanks everyone for the amazing questions also so what dan and myself will do is we'll package up that q a and make sure that we send those to vicky and faye so they can kind of look over those maybe post on twitter or elsewhere so just be on the lookout but with that in mind let's give one more round of applause we're going to wrap this up with some music again so i might try to take over the screen chair and then play that same music to get us out of here but this was just fantastic thank you both of you so much for sharing what you have i think it's a really powerful computational medium tool for thought and uh with that so long [Music] [Music] you"

8 times what Elon paid for Twitter and more than 13 times what Microsoft paid for LinkedIn even ignoring inflation at their PEAK Internet portals like AOL and MSN were basically seen as the whole internet but while young Martin was happily buzzing the windows of his MSN buddies and dads around the world were ecstatic about seeing stock quotes in AOL some idealistic nerds had a really different vision for the future of the internet people like Tim burners Lee were quietly working on something called the worldwide web where any user's computer could connect to any website not just the handful of companies that AOL struck a business development deal with and where the network itself would be fully open and decentralized and to do this HTML was invented as a way to describe the contents of a website in a standardized text file HTTP was invented as a way for a server to then send this text file to a computer that wanted to view their site and programs called web browsers were invented which could then read the file and display the website to the user anyone could make a website anyone could use the protocols and anyone could even make a web browser so the whole thing was permissionless and decentralized and the people in charge of shaping these standards were not companies but instead nonprofits like the worldwide Web Consortium also known as the w3c now for many years the worldwide web was seen as a hopelessly complex and nerdy thing after all how the normal person even know how to find all these random web servers or how could we expect them to learn to use these complex text strings called uniform resource locators just to get around or perhaps just as importantly how could anyone monetize such a decentralized system and if no one could why would anyone bother with putting their valuable stuff up there surely the masses would be more drawn to the closed web portals that were so much simpler to use and yet the open web enthusiasts kept tinkering and of course as we know not too many years later they won in 1990 the first search engine launched making it easy to navigate the decentralized network in 1994 Netscape launched making web browsers really userfriendly soon after the web portals like AOL started including their own web browsers inside their portals then in 1995 Bill Gates announced that Microsoft would jump on the quote internet tidal wave sounding code red and going all in on the worldwide web soon after players like Mozilla and WordPress democratized the open web for anyone who wanted to participate and a Nimble internet native startup called Google quickly took over and built what has basically become the infrastructure of much of the modern internet an incredible search engine a powerful web browser a fantastic free email service that became the default identity for people across most of the internet and even a default way to monetize just about any website just allow them to play some ads on your blog or on your video and you to can make money on this wild thing known as the internet it turns out that the Techno optimists who were so insistent on new standards and protocols and everything else they they were right and they won Innovation and good design made this complex Network super easy to use and its permissionless nature meant that in the place of AOL and MSN we instead got millions of successful websites so the internet became technically decentralized except with time of course companies have found new tools to create wall Gardens even using this infrastructure as well and those new tools are called Network effects and ecosystems and every Tech Giant today is trying to lock you into their W garden with these ecosystems and network effects are incredibly powerful tools and once again they're starting to starve the internet of innovation again but just like back in the '90s there's a new Coalition forming that is aiming to break these wall Gardens again it's a coalition of unlikely seeming enthusiasts again who insist on using protocols like activity Pub and whose plans include building a so-called fediverse a decentralized social internet which will break the walls of the current ecosystems which they think will create a whole second massive wave of innovation and democratization the parallels are very strong with the '90s and it's not just the idealists either Mark Zuckerberg Twitter founder Jack dorsy and the heads of Wordpress Tumblr Flipboard Mozilla and more have all announced embracing some form of this future so that is potentially huge so what the hell is the ferse can it change the whole internet and should we be worried or excited about people like Mark Zuckerberg embracing it let's find out [Music] \nto dig deeper into this topic I interviewed the CEO of Mastadon the CEO of automatic the company that owns Tumblr and WordPress the CEO of open Vibe a client for the fediverse and also two people who run a fairly large Master on instance plus a few others too if this topic ends up fascinating you as much as it fascinated me you can see four of my interviews in full on our streaming service nebula with links in the description thanks to nebula for sponsoring this video have you ever tried to convince somebody to move from from One messaging app to another and met just almost complete insurmountable resistance well in that case you have met the power of the network effect each user already has their Network in a certain app including their past conversations files Etc and giving all of that up is just incredibly hard there's a literal mathematical formula attached to something called the mattal law that states that a network becomes exponentially more valuable as more people join and get connected to it this means that large networks tend to just keep getting larger and that moving people over to a competitor becomes incredibly hard even if that competitor is objectively better for everyone involved which allows big networks to either entify their platform and cram it full of ads or to extort a sort of tax on all the participants or both because good luck moving all of your networks somewhere else even worse if you're stuck with one network a company can then try to use that to force or at least nudge you to use the rest of their ecosystem to creating an Ever stronger dependence for you and gigantic World Gardens that become basically impossible to compete with from the outside think IM message slowly bringing people into the Apple ecosystem whether they want to use an iPhone or not think left leaning Twitter users struggling to leave the platform even if they disagree with Elon musk's decisions think right leaning Twitter users struggling to establish a competing platform after Trump and Alex Jones and a bunch of other people were booted off Etc Network effects are one of the biggest reasons for why people are stuck in their walled Gardens and breaking the effects is one of the main goals of the fediverse and their tool in particular is basically the same thing that it was back in the open web days protocols most prominently a protocol named activity pup and here's how this one works every social media platform if you think about it basically has the same elements like profile names pictures and posts and the same interactions too like likes boosts Etc just displayed a little bit differently so under activity Pub all social media platforms agreed to a shared standard for how to to handle these elements which suddenly makes these systems interoperable and activity Pub is actually a proper standard that is defined and maintained by the same w3c as HTTP and you can see it in action already today its first users were services like Mastadon pixel fan peer tube Etc these are somewhat Niche and nerdy things with a limited appeal at least for now which mostly act as activity PP based clones or at least versions of one of the existing big platforms but since they're all using activity pop they actually have two really important character characteristics first they are decentralized instead of a single company owning Twitter Instagram Etc these new platforms have basically no owners anyone can run an instance on them in the same way that anyone can host their email server and these instances can then just talk to each other to form a shared network in fact you can see in a user's name what instance they are from in the same way that you can see whether somebody uses Gmail or Outlook or whatever else as their email provider and it's not uncommon for large organizations like the BBC to actually host their own instances for their employees too just like with email users can more or less move their accounts between instances and even move their followers along if they don't like how their instance is run and also anyone can build a client to access this shared network just like anyone can build an email client too there are dozens of different apps like this with my personal favorite being Megalodon on Android and there also over 10,000 instances just for madon already too and the second unique characteristic is that anything on activity Pub is actually operable tool a Mastadon post a pixel fat post or a peer to video are all equivalent objects using the activity pop standard so each of these can be accessed from either of the apps so here's me in Mastadon seeing a pixel fed image for example which I can like and comment on using my masteron account which will also show up when viewed in pixel fat 2 and similarly here is a peer tube video including its full comment section viewed in the masteron app which I can fully interact with too now interoperability can become a little bit weird between very different types of apps and content but overall what this shared standard creates is one giant shared network between all the different apps which is what people call the fediverse well that is a terribly nerdy name and it also just seems like a really complex system but I guess the open internet seemed really complex as well until we got used to it and just like the open internet the commercial players are starting to pay attention to the fediverse now too meta has explicitly committed to adopting activity pop for Threads in the future and Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly personally pushing for Federation Flipboard has already rolled out experimental activity pop support so you can see masteron posts in the Flipboard app for example and the other way around too and the Flipboard CEO has a whole podcast dedicated to the fediverse now too then Jack dorsy was working on having all of Twitter become Federated before Elon took over although since then he has moved his project over to his new platform called to Blue Sky Mozilla Vivaldi medium and more are all hosting their own masteron instances Mozilla has invested into Mammoth an activity Pub client that wants to make using the fediverse more userfriendly and automatic has embraced activity Pub as well they have already rolled out experimental support for WordPress the CEO Matt muan wake has confirmed to me that they are still working on getting Tumblr support as well and when I asked if the podcast player pocketcasts which they also own could add support as well Matt said that it was definitely possible later on so there's definitely a lot of interest Beyond just the early adopter techno idealists here already now notably missing from this for now of course are the really big platforms Facebook Instagram Tik Tok YouTube Etc and the current Integrations are actually still pretty limited Blue Sky the new project of Jack dorsy uses something called the at protocol which is competing with activity Pub and not really compatible with it for now for Threads the tests have just started and for now only a few individual thread posts are actually visible through Mastadon in WordPress blog owners have to get an extra plugin and turn Federation on manually and this then allows them their blocks to be viewed through apps like Mastadon in full and CEO Matt millwick tells me that only a few thousand people have used this so far and from what I hear tumbller and threads will both at least initially require users to opt in to having their posts Federated meta and automatic in particular are really large companies under a lot of scrutiny so they are really careful with exposing user data to outside platforms and letting outside data come into their platform especially from people who haven't actually signed their terms of service agreements so there's a whole lot of work to be figured out still not long ago Facebook got lots of backlash around things like Cambridge analytica when they exposed a lot of user data through the Facebook API and so they're likely extra cautious in this new world of the Federated internet all of this will take time but when people like Mark Zuckerberg and Jack dorsy and more are openly saying that this kind of looks like at least some part of the future of social media going forward I think we have to pay a lot of attention and specifically we have to answer two main questions first why would people like this support a new standard a new opening up of the internet that might break their very own walled Gardens and second will all of this work let's start with the why reason number one for why people like Mark Zuckerberg might support such an opening up is that they feel like they might be forced to Regulators around the world are increasingly focused on forcing interoperability the European Union's digital markets act explicitly says that large platforms that they call Gatekeepers have to allow third parties to interoperate with the gatekeeper's own services and meanwhile antitrust laws and regulations are gaining Steam from the likes of the United States Japan Korea Etc we've seen governments attacking everything from Chargers to App Store payments and iMessage monopolies and there's a good chance that if an open standard for social media exists that might soon become kind of mandatory in parts of the world too so adopting interoperability for a relatively new platform like threads might let meta learn experiment and also potentially influence the standard before they're actually forced to do so with their bigger platforms now reason number two for this acceptance is that companies like meta and Twitter actually kind of hate all their moderation options right now moderating A centralized platform is actually not only insanely expensive with tens of thousands of moderators needed but it also comes with an infinite number of controversial decisions that have to be made should Alex Jones or Donald Trump or whoever else be banned it's literally up to you dear Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk and no matter how you choose politicians will drag you to court users and advertisers will hate you Etc but in the Federated system a platform could kick out a user that was bad for business because the people who got kicked out could still just go to another server or start their own and they could even move their followers over if they wanted to it's kind of hard to be angry at that and reason number three is that the network effect that until now worked against Innovation is starting to work for the fediverse too and it's kind of creates a Snowball Effect when the fediverse consisted of just a few Mastadon instances it was basically irrelevant now now that it has over 10 million registered accounts and tens of thousands of instances across many apps it's actually kind of a thing and if even a few of these medium-sized platforms like Tumblr and threads join it will start to rival even the large platforms I mean by now well over 40% of websites on the Internet run on WordPress and pocketcasts could open up basically the entire podcasting industry to the fediverse 2o so while things could happen pretty soon now I have no idea how far away we are from the fediverse becoming a really big thing maybe it will never happened but basically every time a new platform joins the fediverse that shared network grows bigger that makes it more attractive for the next platform to join and so on and so forth so this could spiral into something where a user might think hey why wouldn't I want to join that the shared network instead of one of the W Gardens masteron CEO confirmed to me that this was one of his big hopes and I bet that people like Zuckerberg at least realized this Dynamic too okay reason number four for this interest is that the feder is currently being a little a little bit too technical a little bit too complex and hard to navigate well it's actually not just a bad thing but also an opportunity just like Google and companies like it built the easy to ouse tools and services that made using the open web really userfriendly Zuckerberg might think that they could do the same for the fediverse the most userfriendly app some Central spam filter Discovery algorithms monetization Etc these are all things that meta knows how to build so why not build it for everyone in the same way that Google ads for example work across website and the entire internet users from other fediverse platforms could start using the Technologies and solutions of meta as well meaning that meta could at least attempt to shape social media Beyond just its own wall Gardens too okay and reason number five and this is kind of the Sinister one is that meta might be trying to torpedo this whole thing before it gets big many Open Standards like xmpp or RSS were first embraced by Tech giants like meta and Google just to then be sabotaged from the inside out and then let to die so they might do the same here too maybe meta will do what Apple does with imassage they adopt activity Pub as a standard but then they become its biggest player and they make it so everyone else outside of threads becomes kind of a green bubble a second class citizen to threads so people just end up moving their accounts to threads anyway and the open Alternatives basically just slowly die so these are the five reasons I could come up with for why a company like meta would want to adopt activity pop and regardless of which one ends up being correct like maybe it's a combination of the five as well anyway I actually think there's good reason to believe that the activity PP protocol and the fediverse will succeed regardless the fediverse allows for permissionless innovation in the same way that the early open web did as well for the first time ever a college kid right now can build the next big social app and start with a total addressable user base of at least a few million accounts and indeed the Indie developers are already coming up with creative ideas or a big company like Google who has desperately tried to have its own social media app can soon try again too that is just an incredibly powerful place to be okay so those are all the reasons why I believe this could work but let me throw some cold water on all of these hopes and actually also say why I think it also could fail first all of this ferse thing might just be too Technical and too complex for regular users I mean I personally think that you can get used to this pretty easily but today's world Gardens are very slick and very easy to use so a Federated solution will have a harder time than ever second regular people clearly don't care about Federation until can actually solve a problem of theirs and many people might not want Federation at all I've actually talked to Tumblr users for example who thought that it was quote awful and a terrible idea to let people from outside of Tumblr in as that would break the place's unique culture while masteron die hards often want to block threads on a domain level from federating with their instance altogether because they just don't like the company Matt Milan Wick as a head of Tumblr said that he thought that protocols should support talking to basically anyone and that the users should then be given a choice whether they want to Federate or not which is basically what I think as well but many people clearly just don't want some services to be connected and next moderation could become a problem as the overall Network scales so right now each instance moderates itself they can either block individual accounts or they can also block entire instances this works great right now because you can choose to have for example a very left leaning instance or a very right leaning one or anything else in between or outside where you can even start your own anyway while there are shared block lists and people are working on improving the automation systems and while in my experience masteron content is actually extremely high quality and very wholesome I'm not actually sure how it will scale I had a very good conversation with some people who run a medium-sized masteron instance with four volunteer moderators and a legal counselor and these people sounded very well prepared and just genuinely lovely but I cannot imagine that the average random person hosting an instance would get this detailed and would be this well prepared to handle I don't know large spam attacks or dmca takedown requests or any other number of things so that could become a problem and on the related note one final reason for why I think the activity pop system will be bit challenging in the future is that it does really weird things to content ownership and control see in a centralized platform like for example YouTube the creator of a piece of content can choose what happens with that content I can delete or unlist the video I can block others from re-uploading it Etc similarly abusive content should at least theoretically be removable from the central Authority tool now people can of course misuse these systems and they can break the terms of service agreements but this is still a system that generally does work but in the ferse things get really complicated every post and also the media attached to it generally gets copied to every instance a server that it gets viewed from meaning that a piece of content is often on thousands of servers at the same time now a user can ask for a post to be deleted which by default sends out a delete request to the other servers I'm sure that the vast majority of those servers then honor the requests but there's no guarantee that they do now technically of course you still have rights like the copyrights of your videos for example which still belong to you and I haven't actually encountered anything problematic on Mastodon so far so maybe this crowdsourced approach actually works but yeah I could see it becoming a problem long term so for now I personally don't mind posting basically the equivalent of tweets to the ferse I mean those are basically public but I definitely would not put my videos up there especially given that maston's CEO told me that for now these there basically no plans for Native monetization either as a content creator I of course have to have monetization I mean I spent over a month on this video alone and also thousands of Euros on equipment rent people editing the videos etc etc and so until the fediverse figures out monetization you can support my work by watching my stuff over on nebula as I said I uploaded the four most interesting interviews from my research to nebula that offered me a completely new perspective on the future of what the internet might look like if you enjoy enjoyed this video I think you would love to hear what the really thoughtful people that are running Mastadon Tumblr WordPress and so on think about activity pump or you'd want to hear the actual day-to-day challenges and activities of someone running a mastodon incense for example or you might be interested in hearing what entrepreneurs think about innovating in an open social media environment right now these videos join over a dozen other bonus videos and the whole nebula original series of mine that are exclusive to nebula as well Plus I even have a class that I've published on the nebula classes platform and there are also hundreds of other Fant fantastic originals from easily the best group of educational creators on the internet nebula is a video streaming

with tens of thousands of moderators needed but it also comes with an infinite number of controversial decisions that have to be made should Alex Jones or Donald Trump or whoever else be banned it's literally up to you dear Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk and no matter how you choose politicians will drag you to court users and advertisers will hate you Etc but in the Federated system a platform could kick out a user that was bad for business because the people who got kicked out could still just go to another server or start their own and they could even move their followers over if they wanted to it's kind of hard to be angry at that and reason number three is that the network effect that until now worked against Innovation is starting to work for the fediverse too and it's kind of creates a Snowball Effect when the fediverse consisted of just a few Mastadon instances it was basically irrelevant now now that it has over 10 million registered accounts and tens of thousands of instances across many apps it's actually kind of a thing and if even a few of these medium-sized platforms like Tumblr and threads join it will start to rival even the large platforms I mean by now well over 40% of websites on the Internet run on WordPress and pocketcasts could open up basically the entire podcasting industry to the fediverse 2o so while things could happen pretty soon now I have no idea how far away we are from the fediverse becoming a really big thing maybe it will never happened but basically every time a new platform joins the fediverse that shared network grows bigger that makes it more attractive for the next platform to join and so on and so forth so this could spiral into something where a user might think hey why wouldn't I want to join that the shared network instead of one of the W Gardens masteron CEO confirmed to me that this was one of his big hopes and I bet that people like Zuckerberg at least realized this Dynamic too okay reason number four for this interest is that the feder is currently being a little a little bit too technical a little bit too complex and hard to navigate well it's actually not just a bad thing but also an opportunity just like Google and companies like it built the easy to ouse tools and services that made using the open web really userfriendly Zuckerberg might think that they could do the same for the fediverse the most userfriendly app some Central spam filter Discovery algorithms monetization Etc these are all things that meta knows how to build so why not build it for everyone in the same way that Google ads for example work across website and the entire internet users from other fediverse platforms could start using the Technologies and solutions of meta as well meaning that meta could at least attempt to shape social media Beyond just its own wall Gardens too okay and reason number five and this is kind of the Sinister one is that meta might be trying to torpedo this whole thing before it gets big many Open Standards like xmpp or RSS were first embraced by Tech giants like meta and Google just to then be sabotaged from the inside out and then let to die so they might do the same here too maybe meta will do what Apple does with imassage they adopt activity Pub as a standard but then they become its biggest player and they make it so everyone else outside of threads becomes kind of a green bubble a second class citizen to threads so people just end up moving their accounts to threads anyway and the open Alternatives basically just slowly die so these are the five reasons I could come up with for why a company like meta would want to adopt activity pop and regardless of which one ends up being correct like maybe it's a combination of the five as well anyway I actually think there's good reason to believe that the activity PP protocol and the fediverse will succeed regardless the fediverse allows for permissionless innovation in the same way that the early open web did as well for the first time ever a college kid right now can build the next big social app and start with a total addressable user base of at least a few million accounts and indeed the Indie developers are already coming up with creative ideas or a big company like Google who has desperately tried to have its own social media app can soon try again too that is just an incredibly powerful place to be okay so those are all the reasons why I believe this could work but let me throw some cold water on all of these hopes and actually also say why I think it also could fail first all of this ferse thing might just be too Technical and too complex for regular users I mean I personally think that you can get used to this pretty easily but today's world Gardens are very slick and very easy to use so a Federated solution will have a harder time than ever second regular people clearly don't care about Federation until can actually solve a problem of theirs and many people might not want Federation at all I've actually talked to Tumblr users for example who thought that it was quote awful and a terrible idea to let people from outside of Tumblr in as that would break the place's unique culture while masteron die hards often want to block threads on a domain level from federating with their instance altogether because they just don't like the company Matt Milan Wick as a head of Tumblr said that he thought that protocols should support talking to basically anyone and that the users should then be given a choice whether they want to Federate or not which is basically what I think as well but many people clearly just don't want some services to be connected and next moderation could become a problem as the overall Network scales so right now each instance moderates itself they can either block individual accounts or they can also block entire instances this works great right now because you can choose to have for example a very left leaning instance or a very right leaning one or anything else in between or outside where you can even start your own anyway while there are shared block lists and people are working on improving the automation systems and while in my experience masteron content is actually extremely high quality and very wholesome I'm not actually sure how it will scale I had a very good conversation with some people who run a medium-sized masteron instance with four volunteer moderators and a legal counselor and these people sounded very well prepared and just genuinely lovely but I cannot imagine that the average random person hosting an instance would get this detailed and would be this well prepared to handle I don't know large spam attacks or dmca takedown requests or any other number of things so that could become a problem and on the related note one final reason for why I think the activity pop system will be bit challenging in the future is that it does really weird things to content ownership and control see in a centralized platform like for example YouTube the creator of a piece of content can choose what happens with that content I can delete or unlist the video I can block others from re-uploading it Etc similarly abusive content should at least theoretically be removable from the central Authority tool now people can of course misuse these systems and they can break the terms of service agreements but this is still a system that generally does work but in the ferse things get really complicated every post and also the media attached to it generally gets copied to every instance a server that it gets viewed from meaning that a piece of content is often on thousands of servers at the same time"
