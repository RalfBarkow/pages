It argues that if we don't write, we waste our strength and don't make progress. The use of the term \"Fortschritt\" in this context reinforces this idea by suggesting that writing and rereading leads to a forward movement or an advancement. The passage appears to be drawing on the idea that [[Language]] and [[Communication]] (represented by the term \"Logos\") are crucial to human understanding and that directing our mental faculties towards this space of intersubjective understanding is an important aspect of our spiritual lives. Overall, the passage presents a strong argument for the value of writing and rereading."

Wenn wir nicht schreiben, verschwenden wir unsere Kräfte und kommen nicht voran. Die Verwendung des Begriffs \"Fortschritt\" in diesem Zusammenhang unterstreicht diesen Gedanken, indem er suggeriert, dass das Schreiben und Wiederlesen zu einer Vorwärtsbewegung oder einem Fortschritt führt. Die Passage scheint sich auf die Idee zu stützen, dass [[Sprache]] und [[Kommunikation]] (dargestellt durch den Begriff \"Logos\") für das menschliche Verstehen entscheidend sind und dass die Ausrichtung unserer geistigen Fähigkeiten auf diesen Raum des intersubjektiven Verstehens ein wichtiger Aspekt unseres geistigen Lebens ist. Insgesamt ist der Text ein starkes Argument für den Wert des Schreibens und Lesens."
