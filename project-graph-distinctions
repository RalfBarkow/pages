I haven't tried yet because, after working on this for well over a decade, I noticed a pattern where I'd use up all my time on shiny GUI things and never nail the model down before I lost steam. Flipping that has made the system practically more and more useful to me personally, which has kept me motivated. I'm certainly open to collaboration in that area. I haven't shared more about the project management component yet because the model was intensely fluctuating.\nTwo recent developments I'm excited about are that agenda items magically appear in the person's contact card, and I started playing with GTD-like contexts\n\n"

I gather your vision for this is a bit grander than mine ðŸ¤“  as I'm okay with dead tree representation of my tasks while you want proper domain objects (of many kinds) to back your workflows, which is awesome! I may create duplicative work specifically in the direction of drag/drop kanban board type of of UI as Gt enables building these type of UIs yet not much exploration has been done in that direction (would definitely use this as inspiration code-wise https://github.com/StephanEggermont/GToolkitExperiments). \n"
