What information does service currently work with? Together with the Service Association (KVD), the Customer Service Association Austria (KVA) and the Swiss Service Association (SKDV), kothes GmbH has conducted a survey among service technicians for the second time in order to answer precisely these core questions.\n\nTrue to the motto \"Talking to the target group and not just about them\", this presentation provides insight into the results of the Service 2022 Insight Report and addresses the potential of documentation for service.\n\nChristopher Rechtien, the speaker, has 15 years of experience in the world of technical communication and has been innovation manager at kothes GmbH since 2015, responsible for cooperation and research projects, for example."

I'll have to move that to a wiki page. Sorry for flooding the chat with that!)\n"
