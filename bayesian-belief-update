It was with the algorithms of his [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_parametric_mapping statistical parametric mapping] that we began to unlock our ability to use fMRIs to see the mind in the act of thinking. This ability is completely transforming how we understand it – leading to a deeper appreciation of the [[Whole Mind]]."

According to Bayes' rule, the optimal way of using this information is to calculate the information's likelihood under various models of the environment, and to weight this likelihood by the strength of prior belief in each model to derive posterior beliefs. In recent years, the influential hypothesis has been advanced that Bayesian inference represents a unifying principle of neural computation (the Bayesian brain hypothesis.
