Two types of information must be provided, i.e. the 3D spatial position of the nodes and the [[Adjacency Matrix]] corresponding to the network. The typical input data consists of connected weighted networks. Vizaj currently does not work with directed networks. Node labels can be also provided, albeit they are optional. Vizaj offers the possibility to upload those information through standard .csv files or encapsulated .json files. Note that the axis orientation is xzy (and not xyz). Thus, the input data should respect this order to correctly visualize the network in its actual space."
