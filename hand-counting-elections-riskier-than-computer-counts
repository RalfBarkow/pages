      "text": "The US is seeing a growing liberal hostility to checking election results. CNN and ACLU say that counting votes twice, by hand and by computer, is more risky than counting just by computer. This may surprise many states which use hand counts to check computer counts and many countries which just count by hand. The Nevada ACLU director says the hand count &quot;is going to give them the opportunity to tamper with an election,&quot; as if computers are immune from tampering. Election staff have always been partisan, and are constrained by bipartisan procedures and public observation, which are easy to provide for hand counts."
