With a metaphor of Copernican Revolution, he reminisces about the 60s and 70s when network innovation was stuck in circuit switching of the original phone network.  The invention of packet switching changed the center of the networked universe.  He argues for a similarly dramatic shift to named-data networking:  apply cryptography to data instead of pipes to address forces now limiting us.

Customers of the phone system think the phone number is the name of Mom's phone, but it's actually a program to tell the network how to dynamically construct a path to connect the wires. Customers and operators of the phone system had completely different models of the system. The calls that you make are 100% side-effect of the system."

Put N things in series, with individual probability of failure P, the probability of failure of the system is P^N. Bell Labs was the authority on reliability in the 1970s. The only way they could scale the system to a national level was to build extremely reliable components that would run forever. The system itself was unreliable."

By the time we get to the 60s and electronics become available, the system depends on knowing and controlling all the links the in the network and optimizing the use of unused segments."

Put N things in series, with individual probability of failure P, the probability of failure of the system is P^N. Bell Labs was the authority on reliability in the 1970s. The only way they could scale the system to a national level was to build extremely reliable components that would run forever. The system itself was unreliable."

With a metaphor of Copernican Revolution, he reminisces about the 60s and 70s when network innovation was stuck in circuit switching of the original phone network.  The invention of packet switching changed the center of the networked universe.  He argues for a similarly dramatic shift to named-data networking:  apply cryptography to data instead of pipes to address forces now limiting us.
