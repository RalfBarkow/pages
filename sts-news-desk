Three prospective trials I would like to talk to you about hosting in the Boston area: Coastal Community Resilience, Tidal Salt Marshes and Restoration as Systems, and Local Food Systems & Security. (My group has other interests as well.) I am interested in how we might employ our structural modeling software cloud and mobile platforms (Idea Prism and LogoSophia)  as complementary tools for inquiry. And I would like you to take a look at the funding opportunity at the following link through the U.S. National Science Foundation which our group is looking at for this type of work. https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19583/nsf19583.htm\n"
