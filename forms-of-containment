      "text": "> Forms of containment to combat disease can be identified in the histories of many cities however, including the individualized home-quarantines imposed in London during the bubonic plague (or Great Plague of 1665–1666), the development of colonies for excluded lepers worldwide, and the developments of remote tuberculosis sanitoria in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In turn, strategies of spatial distancing, as Legg argues, can be evidenced in the planning history of colonial cities such as Delhi, where the British regime set out to construct a new capital to the south of the existing city or, indeed, in the isolation of lepers from cities. As Foucault argues, strategies involving the rejection or exclusion of people from cities or the imposition of controls upon the movements of entire populations included within cities are two key ways in which power has historically been exerted in related to public health threats, with leprosy and plague emblematic respectively of each approach."
