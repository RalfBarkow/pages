Options for communication are pre-structured according to these schemata, which are thus the premises of communication. The schemata, which are the structures of interactions, correspond to the three →[[meaning]] dimensions: ego/alter (social dimension), constant/variable (temporal dimension), and internal/external (fact dimension). In every interaction, all three schemata operate simultaneously.\n"
