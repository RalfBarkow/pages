One sees: the asymmetry can work also to the advantage of the disadvantaged side: The woman is rather pleasantly surprised by the marriage, the man rather unpleasantly. Whether it was really like that? In any case, another asymmetry follows from this: \"Vir mulierem non mulier virum corrigit\". (Patricius 1518: Fol. LVII)."

At the same time, the necessity of an inversion in the operationally employed distinction between ideality and reality obscures the direction of asymmetry. It functions at the level of the ideal in one direction, but realistically in the other. Historically, this may be related to the fact that the rhetoric of ladies' praise survived the decline of chivalric culture (lamentation about which begins as early as the 14th century) better than the rhetoric of gentlemen's praise. But even this explanation would only show that the masculine logic of asymmetrizing distinction operates, as it were, behind the back of official semantics and sets the relations like that in the direction of a superiority of the man."

The virtue schema is now, especially since Richardson's \"Pamela,\" presented in such a way that the reader can decode it and decode it not only in the direction of deviation, but also in the direction of individuality. The asymmetry now had to refer to individuals, and specifically to individuals who can be observed by the reader in the way they observe themselves and others, in the way they write letters and diaries. But if now this observing of the observer, this \"second order cybernetics\" (Heinz von Foerster) becomes the normal case of reality presentation: how can distinguishing still be asymmetrized? As distinguishing observers by observers? As differentiation of women and men by the feminist movement? And if so, will women's studies then be able to distinguish itself from the feminist movement?"

The old paradox is: how a system could occur again in itself, and it was resolved by the concept of representation. The asymmetries caused by it are criticized today against the background of a norm of equality. But this norm in turn invisibilizes a paradox, namely the paradox of the indistinguishability of the distinguished. With the paradoxes the semantics resolving them change, and at the same time the now convincing solutions are adapted to a more dynamic society. Asymmetries are conceived as relics of an older society, and equality accordingly becomes the goal of reform. Their paradox is outsourced to the future, which is not yet the problem of the present effort (and in this, too, there is an affinity with the time-considering logic of Spencer Brown). The feminist movement takes off, seeking bliss. In doing so, it uses the distinction between women and men to observe reality, with the goal of eliminating asymmetries. But if it is true that asymmetries constitute the usefulness of a distinction in the first place: what does the feminist movement observe by mea"

The central category of a love that can only be won in pairs opposes logical analysis without being able to absorb and include it. The distinction of man and woman is thus stripped of its character as a distinction in the sense of Spencer Brown's logic – hence probably the pseudonym! without its theoretical place being determined. Behind this seems to be the idea that there is this one distinction that eludes the operational logic of \"draw a distinction!\". A distinction that does not distinguish but merges? A paradox? If women's studies wanted to connect here, it would take the ground out of their rather loveless practice, without it being immediately obvious where this would lead."

In any case, it will be only a selection that will be exposed on the beach.

One sees: the asymmetry can work also to the advantage of the disadvantaged side: The woman is rather pleasantly surprised by the marriage, the man rather unpleasantly. Whether it was really like that? In any case, another asymmetry follows from this: \"Vir mulierem non mulier virum corrigit\". (Patricius 1518: Fol. LVII)."

At the same time, the necessity of an inversion in the operationally employed distinction between ideality and reality obscures the direction of asymmetry. It functions at the level of the ideal in one direction, but realistically in the other. Historically, this may be related to the fact that the rhetoric of ladies' praise survived the decline of chivalric culture (lamentation about which begins as early as the 14th century) better than the rhetoric of gentlemen's praise. But even this explanation would only show that the masculine logic of asymmetrizing distinction operates, as it were, behind the back of official semantics and sets the relations like that in the direction of a superiority of the man."
