      "text": "If one proceeds as the theories of organization presented in the first chapter do, one will have difficulty in arriving at a clear concept of organization. If one starts from the distinctions discussed, the concept of organization would have to designate the unity of what is different in each case, i.e., what is the same in the relationship between superiors and subordinates or between rule and rule application or between formal and informal organization or between input and output, etc. However, in all cases this would amount to the paradox of the selflessness of what is distinguished, i.e., to what today one likes to call a \"performative contradiction\": one makes a distinction and at the same time claims that what one means is given on both sides of the distinction: input and output, succeeding and failing rationality; or even: both and the relation existing between both. Apart from that, quite different \"and\" notions of organization would result depending on which distinction one starts from. No wonder, then, that a majority of possible theories of organization are thought to be inevitable."

Kant prefers the concept of interaction, which points ahead to later theories of circular self-reference; but formulated as a causal concept, this solution hides a paradox, because causality presupposes time and therefore excludes time-stable identity of causes and effects with the possibility of a reaction of the effects on the causes. Remained is the suggestion to pass from [[What-Questions]] to how-questions (with Kant: as a question about the conditions of possibility), but the transcendental dissolution of the circle of cognition, which has to presuppose itself, hardly finds approval today; because it had to prove what had to be renounced, namely the essence cosmos and the cognizability of the thing in itself, as an achievement of consciousness."
