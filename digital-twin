      "text": "The digital twin is considered in literature as a breakthrough technology, acting as a mirror of a real system (e.g., product, machine, plant, process, factory, people) by building a virtual counterpart able to provide a means for simulating physical manufacturing systems and objects [7]. In these terms, the digital twin technology allows for analyzing, monitoring, and predicting the behavior of a system, controlling its status in real time, simulating a desired environment, and supporting in a sustainable way the management of the product and service lifecycle. Several authors provide different definitions of the digital twin concept and emphasize some distinctive elements. For instance, Boschert and Rosen [8] highlight the simulation activity allowed by this technology; Schluse and Rossmann [9] and Schroeder et al. [10] focus on the virtual representation of physical objects; Stark, Fresemann, and Lindow [11] consider a broader view of production systems, including their interoperability; Negri, Fumagalli, and Macchi [12] analyze the physical side of the model; Kunath et al. [13] pay attention to manufacturing systems and data flows; Shafto et al. [14] and Kraft [15] construct a multidimensional concept of the technology; Lee et al. [16] represent the virtual counterpart of a machine; and, finally, Rosen et al. [17] focus on processes."

      "text": "However, the development of a shop floor digital twin remains often limited because of the complex convergence of the physical space with the virtual one, which also includes some integration issues [18]. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was the first company that explored and exploited digital twin technology in the aerospace field mainly for prediction, safety, and diagnosis purposes [19]. It is clear that some critical aspects have to be considered such as the interoperability and the bidirectional connection of physical and virtual assets for ensuring a real-time response of the whole system. The Internet of Things (IoT), cyber–physical systems (CPS), information and communication technologies, including artificial intelligence, big data, and analytics, are only some of the most important enabling technologies that contribute to design and shape a digital twin [20]. Furthermore, other important aspects need to be included when applying this technology, such as solution modularity, modeling consistency and accuracy, simulation improvements, integration with immersive technologies, efficient mapping of cyber–physical data and cloud/edge computing integration [21]."

Research about digital twin is still growing and under continuous development and new directions are emerging for further investigation, such as the digital twin as a service paradigm, the massive inclusion of unique assets, the involvement of the human world and unprecedented global challenges [33], the exploitation of different types of data generated during the various lifecycle phases [34], and the sustainability of intelligent production systems [35]."

The digital twin serves as an interface between physical industrial products and digital worlds. This allows you to map the continuous availability of data throughout the lifecycle from product planning and development, production and commissioning to use and recycling. An important step towards this goal is to create digital twins of the components in order to create a database usable for the design of new production systems in a virtual environment. One of the possibilities of using the digital twins is testing and virtual commissioning of production systems. Instead of the classic CAD model, the digital twin replaces a detailed digital image of individual components, including their full functionality. The Digital Twin comprises the CAD model, kinematic behavior model a most important is the logical behavior model. Our goal is to create a digital twin component of the production system, integrate a CAD model, create a kinematic model and a logical behavior model. This digital twin will have signals assigned to it for logical behavior. The result is the verification and testing of the information exchange between the virtual control system and the virtual model, using the Software-in-the-Loop method and the Tecnomatix Process Simulate software environment on the digital twin side and the Siemens TIA Portal with PLC SIM Advanced on the controller side. The result of the knowledge is that the exchange of information is functional and usable for virtual commissioning."

In these terms, the digital twin technology allows for analyzing, monitoring, and predicting the behavior of a system, controlling its status in real time, simulating a desired environment, and supporting in a sustainable way the management of the product and service lifecycle. Several authors provide different definitions of the digital twin concept and emphasize some distinctive elements. For instance, Boschert and Rosen [8] highlight the simulation activity allowed by this technology; Schluse and Rossmann [9] and Schroeder et al. [10] focus on the virtual representation of physical objects; Stark, Fresemann, and Lindow [11] consider a broader view of production systems, including their interoperability; Negri, Fumagalli, and Macchi [12] analyze the physical side of the model; Kunath et al. [13] pay attention to manufacturing systems and data flows; Shafto et al. [14] and Kraft [15] construct a multidimensional concept of the technology; Lee et al. [16] represent the virtual counterpart of a machine; and, finally, Rosen et al. [17] focus on processes."

        "text": "However, the development of a shop floor digital twin remains often limited because of the complex convergence of the physical space with the virtual one, which also includes some integration issues [18]. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was the first company that explored and exploited digital twin technology in the aerospace field mainly for prediction, safety, and diagnosis purposes [19]. It is clear that some critical aspects have to be considered such as the interoperability and the bidirectional connection of physical and virtual assets for ensuring a real-time response of the whole system. The Internet of Things (IoT), cyber–physical systems (CPS), information and communication technologies, including artificial intelligence, big data, and analytics, are only some of the most important enabling technologies that contribute to design and shape a digital twin [20]. Furthermore, other important aspects need to be included when applying this technology, such as solution modularity, modeling consistency and accuracy, simulation improvements, integration with immersive technologies, efficient mapping of cyber–physical data and cloud/edge computing integration [21]."

Research about digital twin is still growing and under continuous development and new directions are emerging for further investigation, such as the digital twin as a service paradigm, the massive inclusion of unique assets, the involvement of the human world and unprecedented global challenges [33], the exploitation of different types of data generated during the various lifecycle phases [34], and the sustainability of intelligent production systems [35]."
