He may not have been a particularly good teacher, or I may have been a stubborn, ungrateful pupil, but I remember almost nothing of that time. But there is one story that is deeply imprinted in my mind and that occupied me for many years: a pious old man, traveling with a donkey loaded with sacks of food, meets a beggar on the street. The beggar asks for something to eat. \"Wait,\" says the old man, \"until I have untied the sacks.\" But before he could do so, the beggar was overcome by hunger and sank to the ground, dead. Then the old man prayed and said: \"Punish me, O Lord, for I have failed to save the life of my fellow man!\" The deep disturbance this story caused me is the only memory I have of my grandfather's many moral sermons. It contradicted everything I was ever taught at school. The story seemed illogical to me (and it was) and therefore wrong (but it wasn't). Only the Holocaust made me painfully aware that the second statement does not necessarily follow from the first."

This feeling of shame is the indispensable prerequisite for becoming immune to the creeping poison and the malignant long-term effects of the Holocaust; no attempt, however meticulous and historically correct, to calculate who could have helped and who could not, or \"who could still be helped\" and who could not, will change anything about this shame."

There is no scientific method with which it could be determined whether the non-Jewish neighbors allowed the deportation of the Jews to happen because the Jews were so passive and compliant, or whether the Jews did not escape their persecutors because they reacted to the hostility or indifference of their surroundings and did not even make the attempt. Nor is it possible to scientifically determine whether the wealthier inmates of the Warsaw ghetto could have alleviated the fate of those dying of hunger and cold, whether the German Jews could have done something about the deportation of the Eastern Jews* Ostjuden or whether the Jews with French passports could at least have made the internment of the \"non-French Jews\" more difficult. And what is even worse: the quantification of objective possibilities and the offsetting of the price obscures the moral core of the problem."

Be it that they actively resisted or had to watch helplessly, be it that they behaved passively and had to fear becoming victims themselves. The decisive factor is that the feeling of shame sets us free and is the only way to learn to understand the moral lesson of the Holocaust and to banish the spectre of this terrible historical experience, which still burdens us to this day and leads us to neglect vigilance in order to be able to live in peace with the past. The alternative is not shame or pride. The alternative is pride in feeling morally purifying shame, or shame in feeling morally devastating pride. I don't know how I would have reacted if a stranger had come to my door asking for protection, putting my life and that of my family in danger. I was spared such a [[Decision-Making]] situation."

      "text": "Certainly I could have rationally justified my rejection to myself and others by taking stock of the lives saved and sacrificed. But it is also certain that I would have felt an illogical but essentially human [[Shame]] that is difficult to explain. And I am also sure that without this feeling of shame, the decision to send the stranger on would corrupt me for the rest of my life.\nThe order established by a murderous totalitarian state dehumanized the victims and those who passively watched the persecution by imposing the logic of self-preservation on both as an excuse for moral indifference and passivity. No one who collapsed under the weight of this pressure should be found guilty. On the other hand, no one should be spared the agony of moral self-loathing for this reason. Only those who feel shame for their own failures can break through the walls of the mental prison that has outlasted its designers and overseers. Our task is to finally destroy the power of dictatorial state terror over the victims and the passive, which continues to this day.\nThe Holocaust is shrinking more and more into a historical episode. The lesson we have to learn from it can be less and less limited to calling those responsible to account or seeking restitution. The criminals who have not yet been brought to justice are now - like many of the survivors - of advanced age. And even if the one or other mass murderer is still tracked down and brought to his belated trial, it is harder and harder to do justice to the monstrosity of the crime with a dignified trial (the embarrassment of the trials against Demianiuk and Barbie are an example). There are also not many people still alive who were old enough at the time of the Holocaust to decide whether or not they wanted to help a stranger. If the historical significance of the Holocaust were to be settled with atoning for and compensating for the injustice committed, one could say that it would be in the best hands of historians as a heinous piece of the past. However, atonement and retribution are not sufficient reasons for never forgetting the Holocaust - this is becoming increasingly clear as we see that the practical relevance of the Holocaust is becoming noticeably less important.\nToday, the Holocaust is less than ever a private matter for prosecutors or direct victims who expect our sympathy, help or concessions; the Holocaust does not only concern the eyewitnesses who struggle for forgiveness or proof of their innocence."

      "text": "The current significance of the Holocaust lies in the message it contains for humanity.\nThe Holocaust has shown us how quickly people who are forced into a situation in which there are no more good decisions, or in which the price for good decisions is infinitely high, suppress the question of moral obligation or do not even ask it in the first place and instead submit themselves entirely to the dictates of rational interest and self-preservation. In any system in which rationality and ethics point in opposite directions, humanity falls by the wayside. Evil can now take its course unhindered and build on the fact that people normally refrain from spontaneous, reckless action - and resistance to evil is, after all, reckless and spontaneous. Evil does not need fanatical followers or an enthusiastic audience. The instinct for self-preservation alone is enough, if it is nourished by the comforting thought that it is not yet one's turn and that one can possibly save oneself through passivity.\nThe Holocaust holds another equally important lesson: while the first is a warning, the second offers hope. Because of the second, however, the first cannot be repeated often enough.\nThe second lesson says that the instinct of self-preservation does not necessarily defeat moral duty. One can be urged to do so, but not forced to do so, so that the responsibility cannot be shifted to those who exert the pressure. It does not matter how many people put moral responsibility above the rationality of self-preservation - what matters is that some did. The fact that a few resisted invalidates the logic of self-preservation and proves that there are always choices. The question is how many must resist the logic of evil in order to destroy it. Is there a certain threshold of disobedience at which the technology of evil fails?"

Mag sein, daß er kein besonders guter Lehrer war, oder ich ein störrischer, undankbarer Schüler, jedenfalls ist mir so gut wie nichts aus dieser Zeit im Gedächtnis geblieben. Aber es gibt eine Geschichte, die sich meinem Denken tief eingeprägt hat und die mich viele Jahre beschäftigte: Ein frommer Greis, unterwegs mit einem Esel, der mit Säcken voller Nahrungsmittel bepackt war, begegnet auf der Straße einem Bettler. Der Bettler bittet um etwas zu Essen. »Warte«, sagt da der Greis, »bis ich die Säcke losgebunden habe.« Aber noch bevor er das tun konnte, wurde der Bettler vom Hunger übermannt und sank tot zu Boden. Da betete der Greis und sagte: »Strafe mich, oh Herr, denn ich habe versäumt, das Leben meines Mitmenschen zu retten!« Die tiefe Beunruhigung, die diese Geschichte bei mir auslöste, ist die einzige Erinnerung an die vielen Moralpredigten meines Großvaters. Sie widersprach allem, was ich in der Schule je lernen sollte. Die Geschichte erschien mir unlogisch (und das war sie auch) und deshalb falsch (doch das war sie nicht). Erst der Holocaust führte mir schmerzhaft vor Augen, daß die zweite Aussage nicht notwendigerweise aus der ersten folgt."

        "text": "Die aktuelle Bedeutung des Holocaust liegt darin, welche Botschaft er für die Humanität enthält.\nDer Holocaust hat uns gezeigt, wie schnell Menschen, die man in eine Situation zwingt, in der es keine gute Entscheidung mehr gibt, oder in der der Preis für gute Entscheidungen unendlich hoch ist, die Frage moralischer Verpflichtung verdrängen oder gar nicht erst stellen und sich statt dessen ganz dem Gebot des rationalen Interesses und der Selbsterhaltung unterwerfen. In jedem System, in dem Rationalität und Ethik in entgegengesetzte Richtungen weisen, bleibt die Humanität auf der Strecke. Das Böse kann nun ungehindert seinen Lauf nehmen und darauf bauen, daß die Menschen im Normalfall von spontanem, leichtsinnigem Handeln Abstand nehmen – und der Widerstand gegen das Böse ist nun einmal leichtsinnig und spontan. Das Böse braucht keine fanatisierten Anhänger und auch kein begeistertes Publikum. Allein der Selbsterhaltungstrieb genügt, wenn er von dem tröstlichen Gedanken genährt wird, selbst noch nicht an der Reihe zu sein und sich durch Passivität womöglich retten zu können.\nDer Holocaust hält noch eine andere ebenso wichtige Lehre bereit: während die erste eine Warnung ist, bietet die zweite Hoffnung. Aufgrund der zweiten aber kann man die erste nicht oft genug wiederholen.\nDie zweite Lehre sagt, daß der Selbsterhaltungstrieb die moralische Pflicht nicht notwendigerweise besiegt. Man kann dazu gedrängt, aber nicht dazu gezwungen werden, so daß die Verantwortung nicht auf diejenigen abgewälzt werden kann, die den Druck ausüben. Es spielt keine Rolle, wie viele Menschen moralische Verantwortung über die Rationalität der Selbsterhaltung stellten – wichtig ist, daß einige es taten. Die Tatsache, daß einige wenige widerstanden, entkräftet die Logik der Selbsterhaltung und beweist, daß es immer Entscheidungsmöglichkeiten gibt. Die Frage ist, wie viele sich der Logik des Bösen widersetzen müssen, um sie zu zerstören. Gibt es eine bestimmte Schwelle des Ungehorsams, an der die Technologie des Bösen versagt?\n"
