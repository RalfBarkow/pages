He had joined a firm, Mullard Equipment Limited, engineers, electronic engineers. And I said: I’ve nowhere to go, my Christ Church fellowship has come to an end, I sold all my books, can I come and stay with you? He said yes. So I stayed with him for a year. I had a room in his flat, and he gave me hand-outs to buy food and things like that, finally, I said to him: Can you get me a job in your firm? He said: Yes, of course! I thought you didn’t want a job. I thought you just wanted to laze about doing nothing. I said: No, I’m desperate for a job. So he got me a job in his firm. At that stage control engineering was a question of controlling things like lifts or elevators the circuit required. They used relais, and transistors had recently been invented. And so my job was to turn the relais circuits into transistor circuits. Now for this they used Boolean algebra which is not at all suitable. So I invented an algebra in which every operator was one transistor and then you just had to manipulate the algebra to get fewer transistors. What I developed was a calculus which every time you used the transistor it had one sign, and that was the [[cross]]. (Heidingsfelder, Knaut, Sichler, & Ludewig, 2019)\n"
