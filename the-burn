We lost cell service as we exited the highway and it didnt come back until we returned! all we had were two blank screens with a geocache icon and a moving blue dot, and I dont even own a GPSr so that wasnt an option either. We dove in and just started driving in the direction we thought it was. We inexplicably took the exact right path all the way to GZ without a hitch... or a map. The grab itself was GORGEOUS and took us farther from the path than we expected. The rain falling on the surrounding dense vegetation made an eerie, beautiful sound as well! All was well until... we sort of got lost on the way back to the highway. We ended up driving really far south, and again, we didnt have maps so I started to freak out a bit. I noticed we were driving by a lot of landmarks I didnt recognize so I decided to turn around and take another go at it. Again, the glowing blue dot on our phones was indispensable as we used it to orient ourselves northward for the journey back to the highway. All told, this was my favorite cache in a long time, so thanks for the adventure! "

This trip in the United States where between the 17th and 28th of March. Some of the places we visited during this trip was Portland, Seattle, White Rock, Boise, Salt Lake City, Rachel, Las Vegas, Grand Canyon, Yuma, San Diego to finish in Los Angeles. Total on this trip, we drove a little over 7000 km which is about 4379 miles. There where a lot we managed to see during these intense days and there is still much left to see to make a new trip later.\nThank you so much for this cache!"

I was NOT prepared for what the drive up was going to be like; I've never driven that close to that big of a drop before. \nEvery new turn seemed to give something new and amazing to look at, though I had to miss much of it due to focusing on the road that was getting covered in alternating rain, snow and sleet the whole way up. Once I got to the hiding spot, I needed to figure out a way down and got plenty wet trying to find a way that didn't involve sliding down the hill on my rear. Despite a few slips, I made it down and was signing in when I heard two people hiking down the trail from where I parked. I have no idea where they came from, but they weren't there for the cache, so we didn't chat long. Naturally, the rain continued until I scrambled back up the hill and closed my car door, at which point the sun came out and shone the whole way down the hill.\nThis was definitely a cool experience and it gave me much-needed confidence for going after Hembre Ridge.\nThanks for the cache!\n"

Looked at some old logs and said it had migrated. HUNH? After the Moth and Dude looked around where they had found it we wandered around back and forth and finally the Moth makes the find for me. Not sure how a 14 yo cache gets to a tree that probably wasn't a tree yet. So we make the journey back over to the VERY large stump and put it back near it's original and intended hiding spot. Please, please, please make sure it stays where it's supposed to be. We don't want a classic and original cache to get archived because someone can't find it.

But,  as you may or may not know from reading logs,  the cache isn't at GZ, I'd estimate it's about 60' SW of the posted coords.  I took an average of 25 readings at the cache location and came up with 45 35.901 & 123 21.832.

We walked down the trail to start our search and the GPSr didn't want to cooperate. the misses said it's over there and sure enough there it was. Signed the log and placed back in the hiding spot.

Once I got to the hiding spot, I needed to figure out a way down and got plenty wet trying to find a way that didn't involve sliding down the hill on my rear. Despite a few slips, I made it down and was signing in when I heard two people hiking down the trail from where I parked. I have no idea where they came from, but they weren't there for the cache, so we didn't chat long. Naturally, the rain continued until I scrambled back up the hill and closed my car door, at which point the sun came out and shone the whole way down the hill.\nThis was definitely a cool experience and it gave me much-needed confidence for going after Hembre Ridge.\nThanks for the cache!\n"

Not sure how a 14 yo cache gets to a tree that probably wasn't a tree yet. So we make the journey back over to the VERY large stump and put it back near it's original and intended hiding spot.

We dove in and just started driving in the direction we thought it was. We inexplicably took the exact right path all the way to GZ without a hitch... or a map. The grab itself was GORGEOUS and took us farther from the path than we expected. The rain falling on the surrounding dense vegetation made an eerie, beautiful sound as well! All was well until... we sort of got lost on the way back to the highway. We ended up driving really far south, and again, we didnt have maps so I started to freak out a bit. I noticed we were driving by a lot of landmarks I didnt recognize so I decided to turn around and take another go at it. Again, the glowing blue dot on our phones was indispensable as we used it to orient ourselves northward for the journey back to the highway. All told, this was my favorite cache in a long time, so thanks for the adventure! "
