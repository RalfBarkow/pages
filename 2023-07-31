This presupposes [[Communication (Kommunikation)]]. The transmission of signals (what is commonly called the transmission performance of communication) is only the means to this end; the function of communication is to make possible the summarized reproduction of corresponding (or: approximately corresponding, similar, perhaps only stimulated, but discrepant) selection performances elsewhere. Reproducible meaning must therefore first and foremost be communicable. In this respect, language serves not only as a variation mechanism, but also as a selection mechanism of [[Evolution]]."
