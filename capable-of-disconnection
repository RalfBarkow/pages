If the people, places and **structures** that are exposed to  nontraditional threats are to be viable systems, then, through the lenses of David Snowden’s Cynefin framework and of Stafford Beer’s **Viable System Model** we can start to design our metasystems and the functional components which are capable of sensing non-traditional threats, responding, surviving, learning, and restructuring at local-to-national levels. From this adaptive perspective we can can begin to ask relevant questions for the coming challenges—COVID-19’s effect on economies being the current one. Solutions to these problems go beyond technical solutions—they require shifts of mind and more complex levels of decision making and rethinking how we live and work together. It requires seeing our communities and the country as **living organisms**—far beyond the complicated machine metaphor that often guides our analyses and policy recommendations. Far far beyond the thinking most economists advising our policy makers. E. F. Schumacher was my kind of economist, not a monetarist. (money-terrorist)\n\n"

Stafford Beer structures his [[Viable Systems Model]] (VSM) specifically to have requisite variety in ever changing complex situations, across multiple scales.  VSM functions are wired to one another and to the relevant environment with homeostats. Additionally Beer reminds us that the fundamental source of viable systems lies in the **smallest units of a system and their environments**. From there we can begin designing structures (sets of homeostatic relationships—ongoing conversations) that are capable of matching solutions to the complexity of the problem. Additionally, Beer and Elinor Ostrom make it clear that providing requisite variety requires an almost Escher-like structure of  **nested recursions **—systems supported by metasystems supported by metasystems. It is not turtles all the way down, but it is structural recursions all the way up.\n\n"

We would do well to remember that the brain is not telling liver cells or even muscle cells how to do their jobs.

Instead of only thinking of the organs as subservient to the head, we can also see the reciprocal—the head serving the organs. With this perspective, we can realize  that most of the work of a biological being is carried out autonomously by each organelle, each cell, each organ, each organ system. True, these systems are coordinated, but most of the metabolism (local action) is self controlled, a dance with their environment, rather than externally and remotely controlled by another entity. This may inform our **designs for resilient networks** consisting of technologies and people. \nDesigns for necessary resilience requires designs which preserve autonomy while also structuring relationships to form metasystemic support functions. The trick is to design the balancing, homeostatic, mechanisms that prevent the loss of autonomy while providing for supporting metasystems.\n\n"

A beneficial side effect of this approach may be decreasing the cost of the metasystem—the overhead, bureaucracy and inevitable errors in timing and finesse. This can seem counterintuitive since we are accustomed to ascribe metasystemic benefits to efficiencies of scale, but large remote systems have their own costs (see Elinor Ostrom) and if they are less than ideally responsive to the component subsystems the costs due to ineffectiveness and inefficiency tend to sore—the metasystems become cancers from the perspective of the component systems. (The size and shape of the head becomes monstrous compared with the size of the supporting body. Of course, from the perspective of the large head, the body is simply too small so they peruse a strategy of enlarging the body to support the large head—usually creating catastrophic policies for both head and body parts.) It is likely that the auditing and coordinating infrastructure should encompass the whole nation and more, but the day-to-day operating decisions should be keep as near the inhabitants as possible—right down in to neighborhoods where regular face-to-face conversations can occur. \nBefore considering efficiencies we must always protect effectiveness.

Perhaps most significantly, leaders must adopt a **metacognitive and metasystemic approach** that is an “indirect” approach, one that depends upon the relative autonomy of component parts.

If the people, places and **structures** that are exposed to  nontraditional threats are to be viable systems, then, through the lenses of David Snowden’s Cynefin framework and of Stafford Beer’s **Viable System Model** we can start to design our metasystems and the functional components which are capable of sensing non-traditional threats, responding, surviving, learning, and restructuring at local-to-national levels. From this adaptive perspective we can can begin to ask relevant questions for the coming challenges—COVID-19’s effect on economies being the current one. Solutions to these problems go beyond technical solutions—they require shifts of mind and more complex levels of decision making and rethinking how we live and work together. It requires seeing our communities and the country as **living organisms**—far beyond the complicated machine metaphor that often guides our analyses and policy recommendations. Far far beyond the thinking most economists advising our policy makers. E. F. Schumacher was my kind of economist, not a monetarist. (money-terrorist)\n\n"

Stafford Beer structures his [[Viable Systems Model]] (VSM) specifically to have requisite variety in ever changing complex situations, across multiple scales.  VSM functions are wired to one another and to the relevant environment with homeostats. Additionally Beer reminds us that the fundamental source of viable systems lies in the **smallest units of a system and their environments**. From there we can begin designing structures (sets of homeostatic relationships—ongoing conversations) that are capable of matching solutions to the complexity of the problem. Additionally, Beer and Elinor Ostrom make it clear that providing requisite variety requires an almost Escher-like structure of  **nested recursions **—systems supported by metasystems supported by metasystems. It is not turtles all the way down, but it is structural recursions all the way up.\n\n"

Instead of only thinking of the organs as subservient to the head, we can also see the reciprocal—the head serving the organs. With this perspective, we can realize  that most of the work of a biological being is carried out autonomously by each organelle, each cell, each organ, each organ system. True, these systems are coordinated, but most of the metabolism (local action) is self controlled, a dance with their environment, rather than externally and remotely controlled by another entity. This may inform our **designs for resilient networks** consisting of technologies and people. \nDesigns for necessary resilience requires designs which preserve autonomy while also structuring relationships to form metasystemic support functions. The trick is to design the balancing, homeostatic, mechanisms that prevent the loss of autonomy while providing for supporting metasystems.\n\n"

A beneficial side effect of this approach may be decreasing the cost of the metasystem—the overhead, bureaucracy and inevitable errors in timing and finesse. This can seem counterintuitive since we are accustomed to ascribe metasystemic benefits to efficiencies of scale, but large remote systems have their own costs (see Elinor Ostrom) and if they are less than ideally responsive to the component subsystems the costs due to ineffectiveness and inefficiency tend to sore—the metasystems become cancers from the perspective of the component systems. (The size and shape of the head becomes monstrous compared with the size of the supporting body. Of course, from the perspective of the large head, the body is simply too small so they peruse a strategy of enlarging the body to support the large head—usually creating catastrophic policies for both head and body parts.) It is likely that the auditing and coordinating infrastructure should encompass the whole nation and more, but the day-to-day operating decisions should be keep as near the inhabitants as possible—right down in to neighborhoods where regular face-to-face conversations can occur. \nBefore considering efficiencies we must always protect effectiveness.

        "text": "The key for any socio-economic-ecological-technical system is to define the **metasystemic purposes** . Know what is important, what is worth defending. Only from there we can begin to handle asymmetric non-traditional threats. Get the meta purpose wrong, relative to non-traditional threats, and the ability to cope worsens. One may decide that the purpose is the viability of the parts and the viability of the protective governance structure—rather than any preconceived strategy such as retaliation or “impenetrable” defenses, or a level of GDP. Let’s not replicate the mistakes of the Maginot Line simply because we have new defensive technologies.\nMy experience suggests that this kind of hyper-complex problem requires ongoing capability and capacity for rapid and robust self-organizing and rapid response. My experience also suggests that the problem itself is structural and that the solutions will need to be structural. Structures are configurations of **networks**.\n\n"

Most people are neither familiar nor comfortable in this space. It is the space most often associated with **dynamic systems and systems thinking.** Because it is often ignored it is critical and is likely the difference between success and failure. If the dynamics are merely complicated, engineers and experts can be engaged to carry us through this stage. **If the system is massively complex...**MUCH TO BE SAID HERE.\n\n"
