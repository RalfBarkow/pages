The dreams of so many to take control of their own destinies, to work with passion with a small group of chosen collaborators and build something of value have been wrecked against the shores of corporate financial drudgery and predatory capitalism. \n\nYou wanted to create a great product or service, but you were told you had to conform and attract investors. You had to don the clothes and adopt the language of the corporate environment, the sense of adventure and freedom you started with became closeted, betrayed and bored to death and struggled on determined to make your ‘exit’. The giving up at the end of your slog that would let you do something else with your life."
