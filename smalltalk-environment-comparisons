The repository ([[Envy Developer]]) is head and shoulders above every alternative. The environment integrates easily and gracefully with external libraries and utilities. The graphics support is well-integrated with the underlying platform, easy to extend, and easy to code. With all due respect to the cynics here, [[Visual Age]] is a better Smalltalk than [[Visual Works]], and IBM is a more reliable supplier than Cincom. The other Smalltalks may be interesting niche players, but are basically share-ware, for better or worse. I use [[Visual Age]] over the other Smalltalks because it is commercially available, robust and reliable, has reasonable performance, and supports a rich set of secondary add-ons and extensions. Most of the time, after a reasonably gentle learning curve, it basically stays out of the way and lets you focus on whatever you're trying to accomplish. It generally provides <i>some</i> existing way to do just about anything I want to do, and seldomly gets in the way when I have to customize or extend that way.

The repository ([[Envy Developer]]) is head and shoulders above every alternative. The environment integrates easily and gracefully with external libraries and utilities. The graphics support is well-integrated with the underlying platform, easy to extend, and easy to code. With all due respect to the cynics here, [[Visual Age]] is a better Smalltalk than [[Visual Works]], and IBM is a more reliable supplier than Cincom. The other Smalltalks may be interesting niche players, but are basically share-ware, for better or worse. I use [[Visual Age]] over the other Smalltalks because it is commercially available, robust and reliable, has reasonable performance, and supports a rich set of secondary add-ons and extensions. Most of the time, after a reasonably gentle learning curve, it basically stays out of the way and lets you focus on whatever you're trying to accomplish.
