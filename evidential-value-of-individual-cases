But politics and the media love concrete events and individual cases. This is because they are usually phenomena that are easy to understand and can be used to reliably trigger emotions. It is precisely individual cases that meet our need for clear interpretations and unambiguous statements, i.e. the tendency toward either-or, black or white. That's why the instrumentalization of individual cases is very obvious. \n\nAmong other things, this can be well illustrated by the political and public discussion on criminal cases. On July 29, 2019, a refugee from Eritrea pushed a mother and her 8-year-old son in front of an arriving ICE train in Frankfurt's main train station. The mother was just able to save herself in the nick of time, but the child was killed. A horrible crime. Right-wing populists in particular saw this tragedy as evidence of a failed policy on foreigners. Liberals and representatives of the left spectrum objected to this impious instrumentalization. After all, the psychiatrically ill perpetrator had, among other things, a pronounced delusion of persecution, through which he distorted reality in an absurd manner. That does not make the crime any less serious. But it has nothing to do with his nationality or with refugee policy. Such psychiatric disorders occur with a similar frequency in all nationalities (Wulf Rössler, for example, cites an incidence rate of 0.6-1.0% and a prevalence rate of 1.0-1.5% - see Wulf Rössler: Epidemiology of Schizophrenia, 2011).  \n"

The terrible killing in Hanau is not suitable as evidence of the dangers of right-wing extremism. If you instrumentalize the crime in this way, you are doing the same thing that right-wing populists were rightly accused of doing with the Frankfurt crime. It is a question of credibility that one should distinguish not only in content but also in methods from populists and extremists. Unfortunately, however, this boundary is far from being as clear as it should be; instead, there are (far too) often fluid transitions."

        "text": "It is bad when the political forces that oppose populism and extremism use the same methods as the populists and extremists they criticize. The terrible killing in Hanau is not suitable as evidence of the dangers of right-wing extremism. If you instrumentalize the crime in this way, you are doing the same thing that right-wing populists were rightly accused of doing with the Frankfurt crime. It is a question of credibility that one should distinguish not only in content but also in methods from populists and extremists. Unfortunately, however, this boundary is far from being as clear as it should be; instead, there are (far too) often fluid transitions."
