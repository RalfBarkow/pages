He explained that the horse uses his head and neck to balance himself, just as we use our arms in the same way. If we try to artificially position the horse’s head we prevent the horse from using himself naturally. Rather like asking a gymnast to perform with her hands tied behind her back! In keeping with this, Mr Hall abhors the use of all gadgets as they all aim to position the horse’s head.\n"

Rather like the young child running down a hill for the first time: Faster and faster, out of control, out of balance, and many tears at the bottom! Soon the child learns that by going more slowly down the hill he can maintain his balance. Robert explained that it is the same with the horse. By the rider regulating the speed, allowing the horse to use his head and neck as nature intended, and doing nothing else, the horse will remain in balance and self carriage.\n"

Mr Hall was very open in blaming the judges. The judges reward the bad riding; those successful riders are sought out as trainers; who teach others to ride in the same way; this way of riding is seen in photos and videos. Mr Hall argues that whether we aspire to it or not our riding will be affected by what we see and either consciously or unconsciously we will emulate. This is compounded by the observation that dressage is one of the few sports where the same people judge, compete and train others!\n"

Again I looked through the magazines at home: This time, the words: The reports from dressage competitions and classified ads for dressage horses for sale. “6year old, easy changes, lateral work established…..”\n\n\nI’m not so sure that the answer lies solely with the judges. The question goes to the heart of why each of us is involved with horses and WHY WE RIDE.\n\nAt the end of the day all riders, trainers and judges have a choice. If we make the wrong choice the only people we deceive are ourselves, our horses and our future. Are the emperor’s new clothes really so stunning? I feel that it is time for some honesty. Thanks Mr Hall for making me think again.\n"
