This paper outlines a research programme that combines these two complementary perspectives to provide a stereo view of dynamics and control. We provide a formally precise mathematical framework that treats dynamics and information on an equal footing and use this framework to explore new techniques for solving problems of measurement, adaptation and stability."

      "text": "Scientists and engineers have been hugely successful in solving problems of design and control. Advances in the physical, chemical, biological and mathematical sciences have been accompanied and driven by the systematic search for technological benefits for society at large. The successes of this search have transformed the ways in which people live and work. One of the most striking transformations of society is the increasing importance of information in providing solutions for problems that were once completely mechanical. For example, a 19th century farmer who wished to provide a cushion against the failure of his wheat crop would plant some fields of corn; today's farmer sells options-bits of information on pieces of paper-to provide a guaranteed income if the crop fails. Whereas 30 years ago a hot-rodder seeking extra performance would bore out the cylinders of his car, put on dual exhausts and a four-barrel carburettor, a modern hot-rodder simply removes the microprocessor chip that regulates fuel injection and timing, and replaces it with a chip that sacrifices fuel efficiency, low emissions, and reliability for power."
