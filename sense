If I understand you correctly, it has nothing to do with communication?\n\nThat's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's true that nothing of what appears on your homepage is communication, but it could very well become a moment of communication. Documents of any kind are not communications. It would also be strange to say that there are communications standing around in a library. At the moment I hold the view, which could still change, that communications are selective references of utterances to utterances – in the time mode of différance and therefore only systemic, not identitary."

In order to characterize the WWW as a social system, we still have to find the operation that relates the documents to each other. This must be communication, but in a special form.\n\nThis is then the second step. In the first, we have identified a sea of documents that are simply put on the web and kept accessible there, for which purpose perhaps the most powerful search engines mankind has invented have been developed. At this level, communication is little new; it makes use of writing, the still or moving image, and more recently, the voice. The environment (i.e., consciousness) makes noise in every conceivable way, and one cannot quite see how this noise and the selectivity of the resulting communication chains should differ from what we have known anyway since writing has existed. Whether one enters something in virtual guest books or reads a virtual article, engages in bumblebee breeding, karate or Chinese cooking recipes, whether one chats, participates in discussion forums, places virtual partnership advertisements or takes part in one of the (for their part extremely interesting) Internet games, all this is communication – as usual, neither faster nor slower, at most more convenient and often more non-committal, if one has not just bought something in a virtual store. You don't see the difference that makes the difference to what we understand as communication anyway. Whether one orders a book via the WWW or goes to the nearest bookstore is at best a question of the quality of life one wants to enjoy."

This is what the popular metaphor of surfing stands for. By clicking on hyperlinks, one can swing through the net like Tarzan on his vines through the jungle or the surfer from wave to wave. In most documents of the first level there are such minimal messages inviting to jump. And if once documents appeared, which are hyperlink-free, the browser provides that one can jump out of the document again or back. After all, the search engines present nothing more than sometimes endless series of branching possibilities."

      "text": "Before we take a closer look at this strange story, however, we can state that every user puts the first-order documents into a virtual concatenation that expires when he switches off. Traces of this virtual concatenation can be traced, one can also reconstruct them oneself by means of sensible devices that record which addresses one has recently visited, but these tracings and reconstructions do not go very deep. The picture that emerges is rather one of many many users placing virtual references over the first-order document level at any moment via hyperlinks that lead to further hyperlinks. From the user's point of view, projection lines or nets are stretched, which change the document level (1) only when entries are made or the trace of a visit (for instance how many visitors someone is) is automatically recorded on a document. Of course, it is also possible to use technology in such a way that user interest profiles are stored somewhere. But the crucial point here is that the virtual linking of virtual documents is done on the basis of a click-and-click process [Anklick- und Durchklick-Verfahren ; R.B.]."

What is interesting here is that what is referred to each other in this way could have only this minimal reference. I mean that apart from the mere reference no logical relation exists at all outside the head of the user, only the mere and arbitrary seeming consequence. I don't want to go into this in depth, but one could think that the différance we have presupposed for all sense processes, this subsequent identification of something as something, takes a kind of microscopic, almost autological form: being mere referring that sets the preceding document identity only as a document – and nothing beyond that. For the user, his surfing can be exciting and instructive, but the documents mean nothing to each other. The relationing is the switching through itself, which might therefore (but I am quite undecided) be understood as communication, but in an extraordinarily reduced, minimally sense-processing form."

It could be exactly one of those socially functioning abstractions we talked about some time ago. It would have almost nothing to do with any specific sense (that would only apply to the users), and it would be completely indifferent to any sense - like society itself or like the functional systems. What it represents as a social system, in which rubrics or categories we should classify it, that is still open. After all, it has features of organization (memberships, but these are not mediated by it but by many other external social systems, in my case T-Online, for example), but it is apparently not decision-based. However, it is probably hard to describe as a functional system, because it would be very hard to describe the social problem in view of which it could be thematized as a solution. Therefore, I argue for thinking of it, at least in the context of this lecture, as a monstrous social system that parasitizes in a still unclear way on special problems posed by the form of society (its differentiation).\n\n"

Similar to society and similar to functional systems, consciousness is, as it were, only necessary as a hypothesis, for instance in the sense that some consciousness out there realizes its own operativity. One could also say that the system treats consciousness extremely schematically, thins it out and reduces it – just to the minimal constellation that it could click, but does not have to click. It functions as a symbol for contingency, not as something in view of whose self-reference any special efforts like understanding would have to take place. "

It does not depend on a special sense and certainly not on a special consciousness. Perhaps this is the reason why people highlighted by mass media seem so attractive, although the stories they stage or that are staged with them differ at most in terms of otherwise not widespread luxuries from the ordinary stories that happen to all of us. The mass media, however, fall under the same law that it doesn't matter whether Stefan Raab or Boris Becker or Claudia Schiffer or whoever is put in the center, the main thing is someone who is suitable.\n\n"

But it is precisely these social formations that impress in their strong (and for other times bizarre) interest in understanding against the structures we have been talking about.

This is what the popular metaphor of surfing stands for. By clicking on hyperlinks, one can swing through the net like Tarzan on his vines through the jungle or the surfer from wave to wave. In most documents of the first level there are such minimal messages inviting to jump. And if once documents appeared, which are hyperlink-free, the browser provides that one can jump out of the document again or back. After all, the search engines present nothing more than sometimes endless series of branching possibilities."

It does not depend on a special sense and certainly not on a special consciousness. Perhaps this is the reason why people highlighted by mass media seem so attractive, although the stories they stage or that are staged with them differ at most in terms of otherwise not widespread luxuries from the ordinary stories that happen to all of us. The mass media, however, fall under the same law that it doesn't matter whether Stefan Raab or Boris Becker or Claudia Schiffer or whoever is put in the center, the main thing is someone who is suitable.\n\nInterposed question: So could one say that the abstractions or general abstractions you're talking about abstract or subtract consciousness, so to speak?\n\nYes, that's what I was getting at today. The WWW was just an example I chose because I suspect you are intrigued by that system. But in principle, it's about the fact that we can also observe the tendency to attach consciousness schematically to it."

But it is precisely these social formations that impress in their strong (and Jur other times bizarre) interest in understanding against the structures we have been talking about. And I would suggest very strongly that these structures will change our ideas about what we mean by consciousness.

It does not depend on a special sense and certainly not on a special consciousness. Perhaps this is the reason why people highlighted by mass media seem so attractive, although the stories they stage or that are staged with them differ at most in terms of otherwise not widespread luxuries from the ordinary stories that happen to all of us. The mass media, however, fall under the same law that it doesn't matter whether Stefan Raab or Boris Becker or Claudia Schiffer or whoever is put in the center, the main thing is someone who is suitable.\n\n"

But in principle, it's about the fact that we can also observe the tendency to attach consciousness schematically to it."
