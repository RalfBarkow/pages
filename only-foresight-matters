The knowledge thusly mined is not magic, but it's also not obvious until you've developed the habit.  And it's extremely helpful, especially when the parallel sense of uncertainty of prediction and shift to higher level is incorporated.  To use the chess example, I would never try to plan out a series of actual moves ahead of time; that's too specific and brittle.  But I would make a plan that sounds like this \"In this game, I'm going to use my knights extensively in the opening.\"  That's partly a learning strategy, but why not plan to learn?",
