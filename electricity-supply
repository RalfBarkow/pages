An LTS consists of numerous heterogeneous components, including physical artefacts as well as social, economic, institutional and organizational structures (Geels, 2002; Hughes, 1987a; Loorbach et al., 2010; Verbong and Geels, 2010). The number and high degree of alignment between components creates [[Inertia]] and “lock-in” (Unruh, 2000)."
