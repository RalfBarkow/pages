ISBN 978-0-203-94055-6. Ms C sits opposite the genetic counsellor. She is pregnant in her fourth\nmonth. A fully ﬂedged physician with extra training in human genetics, the\ncounsellor is an expert on congenital disorders, genetic defects and biostatistics.1 Between them on the table are charts, diagrams and graphs. Behind\nthem is a one-and-a-half hour educational session on the statistical distribution of birth defects, Mendelian inheritance, chromosomal aberrations and\ntheir ominous portents of the unborn child’s future. Because of her age\nand her disabled2 cousin, Ms C’s gynaecologist had diagnosed her ‘at risk’\nand suggested she undergo an amniocentesis. But since an amniocentesis\ncarries new risks and can only provide reasons for terminating the pregnancy,\nthe physician did not want to recommend it. Instead he asked Ms C to ﬁgure\nout what to do. Thus he sent her to the geneticist to enable her to make an\n‘informed choice’. In the genetic counselling clinic, the young physician gave\nher the input he considered necessary for her decision-making task: he ascertained her risk status, added a few more risks she had been unaware of, then\nlisted her options – which basically boiled down to having the test or not –\nand ﬁnally spelled out the chances and risks associated with each option. Ms\nC found out that being pregnant means having to make decisions in the\nshadow of risk: Either she takes the risk of delivering a disabled child, the\ncounsellor tells her, or she accepts the risk of inducing a miscarriage. And if\nthe amniocentesis does not provide the green light she hopes for, she will have\nto consider terminating the pregnancy. But all this is for her and her husbandto decide, as the genetic counsellor repeatedly clariﬁes: ‘You have to make the\ndecision, since we do not bear the consequences.’\n"
