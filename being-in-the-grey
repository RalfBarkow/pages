      "text": "As we seek to inspire creative learners, we recognize that a fundamental mindset shift is needed that transforms teachers into guides and students back into [[Natural Learners]]. To do so, educators must shift their identify, step into the grey area. As a new story of school and learners emerges, new stories about teachers are essential. No longer are we the knowledge bearers. We must become [[Comfortable Being Uncomfortable]] and espouse that we don't have all the answers. We ourselves become learners as we morph the way we teach."

Inquiry has the potential to throw the most competent and confident enculturated 'student' into chaos as they grapple with the notion of finding a way, a path to knowing. They grapple with being in the crucial grey area that is a key part of our foraging for meaning. "

Favouring wondering, questioning and active ‘finding out’, inquiry-based learning asks learners to sit in uncertainty as a means of growing to understand. It gives them the opportunity to return to the most human of activities - learning. "

It's about not having the one answer or bearing the knowledge. It is in this space that learning might be it's most fruitful, where we are true meaning-makers. It requires both teachers and learners to unplan and to release expectations for the journey, valuing that there is more than one pathway or explanation. To think in ways that favour possibilities and are less absolute.\n"
