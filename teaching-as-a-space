This affects, strictly speaking, not only the selection and the weighting and evaluation of the \"world phenomena\", not only certain objectives, not only has an impact on the way of dealing with language and media. The reductions also affect the teachers and the students: a problematic image of man.\nThe grip of educational research forces teachers almost universally to meet the standards of measurability with their instructional planning and actions. However, there are no compelling reasons to accept this standard of functionality unseen. Teaching will not get along without abridgements, but even principles such as \"from the simple to the complex, from the concrete to the abstract\" are not unquestioningly purposeful. But the most recent claim that teaching is a laboratory in which teachers should be expected to stage research situations themselves is highly problematic in terms of resonance didactics (Pieper 2018). Reductions with regard to the social spaces from which students and teachers come are not even addressed here, although attitudes and already available \"competencies\" are an important starting point of all further learning, as are meaning expectations as \"directionally guided and selective understanding\" (Birkmeyer 2014, p. 764).\nReductions - represented by the crossbars in model lb - occur at key points in the relational space of instruction. For example, when the students' prior knowledge is not sufficiently included and not their own horizon of thinking; or their language level, when language is taught exclusively as a rigid system of norms, when literary-scientific terms are superimposed on approaches to understanding literature and their world views, when teachers blindly orient themselves to test offerings and textbook knowledge when making selection decisions, which are then referred to as \"competency goals\"."
