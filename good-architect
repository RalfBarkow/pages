While this is good, most great architects I know of are humble, un-assuming, and have a very difficult time communicating. Look at the differences between Jobs and Woz? Jobs was a communicator and leader while Woz was an architect who didn't much care about being a <i>leader</i> or <i>leading</i>. Unfortunately, most people end up thinking Jobs was an architect just because of his ability to communicate and lead. This may not be a great example, I but think it gets my point across.",
