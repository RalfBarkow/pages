      "text": "Contemporary postcolonial travel writing presents a multiplicity of avenues for exploring the dialectics of place and self. Travel writing is generically structured around the itinerary of the travelling subject, but narratives which focalize their material through the prism of postcolonialism are as much concerned with mapping the traveller’s own subject positions and sites of enunciation. If, as Bill Ashcroft asserts, travel writing is about ‘another place in the mind’ rather than about travel itself, then the topological features delineated within the text must necessarily include the traveller’s imaginary landscape (Ashcroft, 2009: 229). In constructing an account of the journey, the traveller/writer navigates a set of epistemic coordinates in addition to the range of specific geographical locations visited, and these dual and mutually constitutive planes intersect in producing the traveller’s experience of place. The heterogeneity and global (as distinct from universal) context of the postcolonial highlights the need for careful interrogation of the complexities and implications of any traveller’s geographical and epistemological location. By situating the voice and agency of the traveller/writer in relation to a cartography of specific, local and particular vis-à-vis representative, global and general sites of enunciation it becomes possible to articulate travel within the domain of the postcolonial. As such, postcolonial travel writing approaches its subject material with and through the realization that the act of writing a place is a simultaneous production of the self and its range of identifiable speaking positions."

What is not addressed by the concept of countertravel writing, then, is the difficulty of placing the voice which is speaking to us in A Small Place in either of the univocal categories indicated by the distinction between travel writing and countertravel writing. The argument presented in this chapter interrogates the sites and speaking positions of the traveller/narrator of A Small Place by locating Kincaid’s text on a continuum of vocalization which spans and transcends the categories of autobiography, performance and ventriloquism.
