The duration of each period is represented by the length of the edge. Here's a breakdown of the key points:\n\n1. **Definition of Tree \\( R(k) \\)**:\n   - The tree \\( R(k) \\) has \\( k \\) leaves corresponding to particle births and branch points corresponding to coalescences.\n   - Edges represent time periods between events, and their lengths indicate the duration of these periods.\n   - This definition ensures consistency and the leaf-tight property, which are essential for establishing the existence of a representing continuum random tree.\n\n2. **Representation as a Continuum Random Tree**:\n   - The passage mentions Theorem 3, which establishes the existence of a representing continuum random tree based on the properties of \\( R(k) \\).\n   - By inducing an order on \\( R(k) \\) and verifying certain conditions, the continuum random tree can be coded from a continuous random function.\n\n3. **Underlying Discrete Model**:\n   - The passage briefly mentions the discrete model underlying the construction of \\( R(k) \\), referring to a paper by Nguyen (1990) for more details.\n   - In the discrete model, edges are drawn uniformly and independently for each vertex in the vertex set, leading to random trees rooted at a specific point and with a defined height.\n\n4. **Convergence to Continuum Random Tree**:\n   - It is intuitively clear that as the discrete random trees are rescaled by \\( 1/h \\), where \\( h \\) is the height, they converge to the continuum random tree defined earlier.\n   - This convergence can be formally proved using the ideas presented in Nguyen (1990) and Section 3 of the paper.\n\nOverall, the passage outlines the construction of a random graph-theoretic tree \\( R(k) \\) and its representation as a continuum random tree, highlighting the convergence properties between discrete and continuous models.
