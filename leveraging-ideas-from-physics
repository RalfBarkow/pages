But one of the most powerful things about having a general paradigm for theoretical science is that it implies a certain unity across different areas of science—and by providing a common framework it allows results and intuitions developed in one area to be transferred to others.\n\nSo with its roots in fundamental physics the multicomputational paradigm immediately gets to leverage the ideas and successes of physics—and in effect use them to illuminate other areas.\n\nBut just how does the multicomputational paradigm work in physics? And how did it even arise there? Well, it’s not something that the traditional mathematical approach to physics would readily lead one to. And instead what basically happened is that having seen how successful the computational paradigm was in studying lots of kinds of systems I started wondering whether something like it might apply to fundamental physics.\n\nIt was fairly clear, though, that the ordinary computational paradigm—especially with its “global” view of time—wasn’t a great match for what we already knew about things like relativity in physics. But the pivotal idea that eventually led inexorably to the multicomputational paradigm was a hint from the computational paradigm about the nature of space.\n\nThe traditional view in physics had been that space is something continuous, that serves just as a kind of “mathematical source of coordinates”. But in the computational paradigm one tends to imagine that everything is ultimately made of discrete computational elements. So in particular I began to think that this might be true of space.\n\nBut how would the elements of space behave? The computational approach would suggest that there must be “finitely specifiable” rules—that effectively define “update events” involving limited numbers of elements of space. But right here is where the multicomputational idea comes in. Because inevitably—across all the elements of space in our universe—there must be a huge number of different ways these updating events could be applied. And the result is that there is no just one unique “computational history”—but instead a whole multiway system with different threads of history for different sequences of updating events.\n\nAs we’ll discuss later, it’s the updating events—and the relations between them—that are in a sense really the most fundamental things in the multicomputational paradigm.

So it’s really a question of how a “[[branching brain]]” will perceive a “branching universe”. And that depends on what reference frame (or “quantum observation frame”) we pick. But as soon as we insist that we maintain a single thread of experience, or, equivalently, that we sequentialize time, then—together with computational boundedness—this puts all sorts of constraints on the reference frames we pick."

And the answer is that it basically appears to correspond to quantum mechanics.\n\nBut there’s actually more to it. What we get is a kind of generic multicomputational result—that doesn’t depend on the details of underlying rules or particular choices of reference frames. Structurally it’s basically the same result as for ordinary space. But now it’s interpreted in terms of branchial space, quantum states, and so on. And what was interpreted as the geodesic equation of general relativity now essentially gets interpreted as the path integral of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn a sense it’s then a basic consequence of the multicomputational nature of fundamental physics that quantum mechanics is the same theory as general relativity—though operating in branchial space rather than ordinary space.\n\nThere are important implications here for physics. But there are also general implications for all multicomputational systems. Because the sophisticated definitions and phenomena of both general relativity and quantum mechanics we can now expect will have analogs in any system that can be modeled in a multicomputational way, whatever field of science it may come from.\n\nSo, later, when we talk about the application of the multicomputational paradigm to other fields, we can expect to talk and reason in terms of things we know from physics. So we’ll be able to bring in light cones, inertial frames, time dilation, black holes, the uncertainty principle, and much more. In effect, the common use of the multicomputational paradigm will allow us to leverage the development of physics—and its status as the most advanced current area of theoretical science—to “physicalize” all sorts of other areas, and shed new light on them. As well, of course, as taking ideas and intuition from other areas (including ones much closer to everyday experience) and “applying them back” to physics."

With a variety of caveats the basic answer is that in the limit of a “sufficiently large universe” they’ll perceive average behavior that’s simple enough to describe mathematically, and specifically to describe as following Einstein’s equations from general relativity. And the key point is that this is in a sense a generic result (a bit like the gas laws in thermodynamics) that’s independent of the details of the underlying rule.\n\nBut there’s more to this story. We’ll talk about it a bit more formally in the next section. But the basic point is that so far we’ve just talked about picking reference frames in a “spacetime causal graph”.

In the case of the causal graphs we’ve discussed so far, what we’re doing is to treat certain events as equivalent in the sense that they can be viewed as happening “in the same time slice” or effectively “simultaneously”. But if we just pick two events at random, there’s no guarantee that it’ll be consistent to consider them to be in the same time slice.\n\nIn particular, if one event causally depends on another (in the sense that its input requires output from the other), then it can only occur in a later time slice.

Similarly, if two events can occur in the same time slice, we can say that they are “spacelike separated”.

And then there’s a third case, which is that different events can occur on different branches of the multiway graph—in which case we say that they’re branchlike separated.\n\nAnd in general when we pick a reference frame in the full multiway system, we can have time slices that contain both spacelike- and branchlike-separated events. What’s the significance of this? Basically, just as spacelike separation is associated with the concept of ordinary space, branchlike separation is associated with a different kind of space, that we call branchial space.\n\nWith a multiway graph of the kind we’ve drawn above (in which every node represents a possible “complete state of the universe”), we can investigate “pure branchial space” by looking at time slices in the graph: […]"

        "text": "But to define a branchial graph, we have to pick the analog of a reference frame: we have to say what branchlike-separated events we consider to happen “at the same time”. In the case of spacelike-separated events it’s fairly easy to interpret that what we get from a reference frame is a view of what’s happening throughout space at a particular time. But what’s the analog for branchlike-separated events?\n\nIn effect what we’re doing when we make a reference frame is to treat as equivalent events that are happening “on different branches of history”. At first, that may seem like a very odd thing to do. But the thing to understand is that as entities embedded in the same universe that’s generating all these different branches of history, we too are branching. So it’s really a question of how a “branching brain” will perceive a “branching universe”. And that depends on what reference frame (or “quantum observation frame”) we pick. But as soon as we insist that we maintain a single thread of experience, or, equivalently, that we sequentialize time, then—together with computational boundedness—this puts all sorts of constraints on the reference frames we pick.\n\nAnd just as in the case of ordinary space, the result is that it ultimately seems to be possible to give a fairly simple—and essentially mathematical—description of what the observer will perceive. And the answer is that it basically appears to correspond to quantum mechanics.\n\nBut there’s actually more to it. What we get is a kind of generic multicomputational result—that doesn’t depend on the details of underlying rules or particular choices of reference frames. Structurally it’s basically the same result as for ordinary space. But now it’s interpreted in terms of branchial space, quantum states, and so on. And what was interpreted as the geodesic equation of general relativity now essentially gets interpreted as the path integral of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn a sense it’s then a basic consequence of the multicomputational nature of fundamental physics that quantum mechanics is the same theory as general relativity—though operating in branchial space rather than ordinary space.\n\nThere are important implications here for physics. But there are also general implications for all multicomputational systems. Because the sophisticated definitions and phenomena of both general relativity and quantum mechanics we can now expect will have analogs in any system that can be modeled in a multicomputational way, whatever field of science it may come from.\n\nSo, later, when we talk about the application of the multicomputational paradigm to other fields, we can expect to talk and reason in terms of things we know from physics. So we’ll be able to bring in light cones, inertial frames, time dilation, black holes, the uncertainty principle, and much more. In effect, the common use of the multicomputational paradigm will allow us to leverage the development of physics—and its status as the most advanced current area of theoretical science—to “physicalize” all sorts of other areas, and shed new light on them. As well, of course, as taking ideas and intuition from other areas (including ones much closer to everyday experience) and “applying them back” to physics."
