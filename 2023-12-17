My Matrix home server and the Matrix client, which supports this 'old' server version on my Freedombox, don't really cope well with the threads. So I find it very difficult to follow the threads here. And it seems more and more paradoxical to me that we talk more about wiki here in this Matrix space than working together (keyword: pair programming) on pages. I don't want to go so far as to say that the male monologue predominates here, but I would like to set this sting."

I counted 60 links on Talk Page. Honestly, I can't tell what that page is even about. I think it is an index page embedded in a web of index pages. I'm assuming this helps you maintain a mental map which you can refresh by zipping around touching a dozen pages that already mean something to you. For me it is just a guessing game for which the conversation here provides crucial clues. Of course these clues scroll away never to be seen again. I think that is your point. I don't have a solution."

For example, consider the following enterprise-level security requirements regarding an XMPP server: permit client-to-server (C2S) access to the XMPP server; permit clients to transfer files over XMPP on the internal network and permit server-to-server (S2S) access with trusted external XMPP servers. However, implementing access-control rules for XMPP clients and servers is not just about making ports 5222 (C2S) and 5269 (S2S) accessible on the XMPP server and/or intermediatory access controls such as firewalls. One may wish to only permit certain C2S communication (for example, by an IP address whitelist), require clients to use TLS encryption, accept only SASL [31] authentication from some S2S communication and dialback [24] authentication for others, prevent external file transfer and deal with XMPP traffic that is tunneled through proxies (for example, XMPP HTTP-bind). Furthermore, XMPP traffic does not necessarily have to communicate on the IANA [19] recommended XMPP ports. It may also be prudent to provide content sanitation at the application-layer. For example, controlling Spam over Instant Messaging (SPIM) by filtering known SPIM signatures within XMPP message stanzas."

Goodman (1965) found a 60-80 per cent improvement in reading accuracy when children read words in story context rather than isolation, as in a word list. He argued that story context provided extra linguistic cues which children exploited so as to assist in word identification. To Goodman these data indicated that reading was indeed a sophisticated guessing game•"

He argued that story context provided extra linguistic cues which children exploited so as to assist in word identification. To Goodman these data indicated that reading was indeed a sophisticated guessing game•"

The decision was in favour of Gough, who argues that reading is not a guessing game. Goodman's view seemed more appropriate in cases where decoding was difficult. In such cases, given a rich sentence context, it is possible for the reader to guess the meanings of some words."
