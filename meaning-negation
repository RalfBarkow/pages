Franz shows how Spencer Brown appropriated and redesigned the Sheffer stroke to “write down” what the NOR transistors at Mullard Equipment Ltd. actually did in practice. As a notation of NOR, the cross does not presuppose but rather contains NOT. It is hence the perfect continence of the cross that motivates Franz to see the NOR typescript as a prelude to a programmatic aestheticization of mathematics and logics. In looking at the typescript, we see that for the human-computer Spencer Brown computation still meant manuscripture performed in a specifically controlled and, as Franz insists, particularly elegant way. Franz concludes that negation is an integral aspect of both the operation indicated by the drawn sign(s) and of the sign-process itself.\n"
