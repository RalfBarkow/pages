        "text": "After leaving a port where passengers had changed as usual, this order suddenly broke down. The new arrivals had taken the deck chairs and claimed permanent ownership. They therefore declared even a deck chair that was temporarily not occupied by them as \"occupied\". This was still not enforceable by occupancy symbols. But it succeeded through the joint effort of all also-occupants. If you approached a free deck chair in any suspicious way, you were rejected by the poses, gestures and shouts of the also-owners. The deterrent actions were so impressive that a physical conflict did not occur. "

        "text": "After the assertion of exclusive powers of disposal of a subgroup over a generally coveted commodity, the hodgepodge of passengers acquired structure. Two classes had established themselves, possessors and non-possessors, positively and negatively privileged. If one compares these two new subgroups with the totality of passengers who had participated in the earlier order, it immediately becomes apparent that what was really original about the new order – at least in its first phase – was the establishment of [[Negative Privileges]]. One subgroup was denied access to a commodity. The privileged subgroup, on the other hand, could use this good as needed, i.e. just as everyone could before. "
