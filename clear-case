It is good at keeping you from accidentally writing new files and forgetting to add them to source control.  It could theoretically save compile time by \"winking in\" object files that it's compiled with the same set of sources, but that's less relevant as the speed difference between compilers and hard drives increases.  But if you set Git (or any other source control) up as a filesystem, then <i>every file read</i> becomes an SCM hit.  So if you're writing in C and have a header that's used in 500 source files, that's 500 Git requests to serve that one file during a compile.  You don't want to know how many file reads a C compiler does in a medium sized project.  Maybe Git is fast enough to handle this, maybe not. I do know that I've had [[Clear Case]] installations where it took ten minutes to get a directory listing.  --[[Rob Mandeville]]",

It is good at keeping you from accidentally writing new files and forgetting to add them to source control.  It could theoretically save compile time by \"winking in\" object files that it's compiled with the same set of sources, but that's less relevant as the speed difference between compilers and hard drives increases.  But if you set Git (or any other source control) up as a filesystem, then <i>every file read</i> becomes an SCM hit.  So if you're writing in C and have a header that's used in 500 source files, that's 500 Git requests to serve that one file during a compile.  You don't want to know how many file reads a C compiler does in a medium sized project.  Maybe Git is fast enough to handle this, maybe not. I do know that I've had [[Clear Case]] installations where it took ten minutes to get a directory listing.  --[[Rob Mandeville]]",
