Habeck had previously been in Qatar to negotiate a new \"energy partnership\" - and now defended himself against criticism by denouncing hypocritical moralism himself. \"We are blazing a trail of devastation through the earth with our daily lives,\" he raged. He lamented the self-deception of a society whose gasoline is derived from Saudi oil and for whose mince pies creatures suffer miserably on mass farms - and which, at the same time, gets upset when the minister sets up deals with Qatar. This is what it was all about: Habeck was accused of merely replacing one devil, Vladimir Putin, with another, namely a ruling clique that is a party to one of the most victimized wars of this time - the civil war in Yemen - and exploits countless migrant workers under the worst conditions."

It's not my fault if the Greens can't realize their ideals, it's the fault of a society that lets itself get along far too well. Habeck makes the gap between aspiration and reality productive: It is an incentive for him to really get down to business - and, of course, it is the legitimation to get the citizens in the mood for hard times. He accepts the reproach of not living up to his own moral standards and still uses it to justify himself. No matter how mumbled he sounds when he speaks, rhetorically it is a tour de force."
