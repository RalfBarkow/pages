Experience may tell a fish to swim away fast if they see a red-and-white striped shape, for example. They may not remember each encounter with striped enemies, but the sum of bad experiences has left a \"map\" of fright-flight when stripes are seen. This is \"lossy\" learning, but still effective learning. Similarly, I may not remember each incident when a certain coding pattern caused maintenance problems, but the association of a given pattern and resulting problems still remains in my head. It's a \"bad feeling\", but only a feeling because we may not be able to dump out a list of the incidents that led to this feeling. Each experience slightly ratchets up the weights on various neuron firing thresholds. After repeated encounters, these weightings grow stronger until an instinctive impression is made. We don't necessarily remember the cause of each incremental ratcheting, for that's not necessarily \"kept\" by the brain.   --top",

Experience may tell a fish to swim away fast if they see a red-and-white striped shape, for example. They may not remember each encounter with striped enemies, but the sum of bad experiences has left a \"map\" of fright-flight when stripes are seen. This is \"lossy\" learning, but still effective learning. Similarly, I may not remember each incident when a certain coding pattern caused maintenance problems, but the association of a given pattern and resulting problems still remains in my head. It's a \"bad feeling\", but only a feeling because we may not be able to dump out a list of the incidents that led to this feeling. Each experience slightly ratchets up the weights on various neuron firing thresholds. After repeated encounters, these weightings grow stronger until an instinctive impression is made. We don't necessarily remember the cause of each incremental ratcheting, for that's not necessarily \"kept\" by the brain.   --top",
