Most companies that succeed in achieving agility at scale grew their ways of working internally, without any scaled framework ([[Luca Minudel, 2020]]). A pluralistic approach ([[Mike Burrows, 2019]]) that takes inspiration from multiple sources such as sets of relevant principles, patterns, practices, and also non-scaled frameworks, is by far superior.\nThe generative principles presented here aim to be a compass for such an approach.\n"
