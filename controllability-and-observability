      "text": "Second, the paper proposes a fundamentally different method for quantum feedback control in which the feedback loop preserves quantum coherence. Here the controller gains quantum information, which carries quantum phases, processes it using quantum logic to preserve those phases, and feeds the quantum information coherently back to the system. Since the controller is processing and feeding back quantum information, this method will be called coherent control with quantum feedback. Such coherent quantum feedback should be distinguished from the methods of coherent quantum control with classical feedback described in the previous paragraph: the term ‘‘coherent control’’ refers to a broad variety of highly successful techniques for controlling quantum systems in a fashion that respects quantum coherence. Both of the methods discussed here use coherent control. When ‘‘conventional’’ coherent control is used with feedback, however, up until now the feedback loop has been taken to be classical and incapable of preserving quantum coherence. As will be seen below, a coherent controller that uses quantum feedback can accomplish tasks—in particular, the generation, transformation, and transfer of [[Entanglement]]—that cannot be accomplished by coherent control with classical feedback. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for finite-dimensional Hamiltonian quantum systems to be observable and controllable by controllers that use coherent quantum feedback. Both of these theoretical results are presented in the context of simple experiments, readily realizable using quantum optics and nuclear magnetic resonance, that highlight the difference between coherent control with classical feedback and coherent control with quantum feedback."
