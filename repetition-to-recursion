At the same time, for nearness of co-existence to occur as a relational background in which languaging could arise spontaneously in the recursion of doing things together, it must be permanent, or recurrent and sufficiently prolonged.  What can we say now about what may have been the biological fundaments for such nearness in the origin of our lineage as languaging primates?"

Indeed, it must have been about the size of the brain of a chimpanzee.  Dogs do not live in language among themselves or with us, but when we live with them in some stable nearness in intimacy and in the proper flow of recurrent interactions, we can live languaging circumstances with them, in which they participate in a more or less extended episodic manner.  So the brain size of a dog allows it to enter with us in consensual coordinations of consensual coordinations of behaviors."

      "text": "But for that to happen to a dog living with us, or for that to happen between any pair of animals, certain emotioning (or configuration of relational dynamics) is necessary.  That is, the emotioning must be such that the frequent recurrent interactions that take place between those animals should conform a domain of coordinations of behavior in which recursive consensual coordinations of coordinations of behavior may arise.  Furthermore, a special emotioning must also take place in the living together in coordinations of consensual behaviors so that the occasional episodes of languaging lived may become a manner of living that is conserved as a matter of course in the spontaneous learning of the offspring, with the result that a lineage defined by a coexistence in language begins.  According to us, since love is the only emotional dynamics that gives rise to a living together in the close and sensual nearness in which a prolonged living together in recursive consensual coordinations of doings can take place for the pleasure of it, that emotioning must be love."

At the same time, for nearness of co-existence to occur as a relational background in which languaging could arise spontaneously in the recursion of doing things together, it must be permanent, or recurrent and sufficiently prolonged.  What can we say now about what may have been the biological fundaments for such nearness in the origin of our lineage as languaging primates?"

That is, the emotioning must be such that the frequent recurrent interactions that take place between those animals should conform a domain of coordinations of behavior in which recursive consensual coordinations of coordinations of behavior may arise.  Furthermore, a special emotioning must also take place in the living together in coordinations of consensual behaviors so that the occasional episodes of languaging lived may become a manner of living that is conserved as a matter of course in the spontaneous learning of the offspring, with the result that a lineage defined by a coexistence in language begins.  According to us, since love is the only emotional dynamics that gives rise to a living together in the close and sensual nearness in which a prolonged living together in recursive consensual coordinations of doings can take place for the pleasure of it, that emotioning must be love."
