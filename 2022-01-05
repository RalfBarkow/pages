I liked a lot the different approaches to programming as part of the informatics transdiscipline. I also wouldn't say it's a discipline, and it is more a networked knowledge, more like design, without a particular \"founding\" knowledge \"below\" to sustain it, but with several, side by side, in the networked knowledges/practices that sustain it. Particularly I liked \"[[Analysis as Storytelling]]\" (…) and even some broken links are evocative \"[[Analysis Is Journalism]]\", \"[[Programming is Art]]\" and \"[[Design is Engineering]]\".\n\n"

That's what I like about how GT makes explicit [[Example Driven Development]], because, as and educator, I can think in [[examples]], but starting with tests seem pretty unnatural and \"engineery\". And it is because interactive notebooks allows this intertwine of prose, code, data and visualizations, that programming seems approachable and pertinent. I was describing this critical code/data literacy that distance itself of traditional introduction to informatics and what I call the \"Non 'hello world!' introduction to informatics\" in a recent Twitter thread regarding our use of Lepiter and a more structured alternative to one to one onboarding:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/offrayLC/status/1478152896676081667 \n\nOffray"
