It has been previously called: \"Charter for Building a Data Commons of Alternative Economies\" or \"Mapping for the Commons Manifesto\".\nThe Charter was edited by participants of the \"Intermapping\" meeting [https://hack.allmende.io/s/intermapping-2017# html] in 2017 hoping to provide orientation to the countless mapping processes for a free, fair and sustainable world.\nIt \"does not describe the vision, scope or values of a specific mapping project.  It is rather an expression of Data Commons principles. It will help you reimagine how you protect the animating spirit of your mapping project and prevent your data from being co-opted or enclosed.”\n"

Make your community thrive.  \nFor the project to be successful, a reliable community is more important than anything else. Care for those who might support you when you need them most.\n\n# 3.

Design for interoperability. \nThink of your map as a node in a network of many maps. Talk with other contributors to the Data Commons to find out if you can use the same data model, licence and approach to mapping.\n\n# 5. Care for a living [[vocabulary]]. \nVocabularies as entry points to complex social worlds are always incomplete. Learn from other mappers’ vocabularies. Make sure your vocabulary can be adjusted.

It is rather an expression of Data Commons principles. It will help you reimagine how you protect the animating spirit of your mapping project and prevent your data from being co-opted or enclosed.”\n"
