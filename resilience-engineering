A temporal analysis in a multi-variate two-dimensional space confirms the significance and relevance of the identified research factors. An in-depth analysis of the five research factors, labeled as the need of RE, RE for modelling, defining and exploring RE, reflecting on RE, RE and improvisation, guides the definition of future research paths and open research questions within the field and across several domains, suggesting the need for multi-disciplinary future studies."
