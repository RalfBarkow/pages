This is also reflected in the composition of class 6b at the cooperative comprehensive school. Mr. Bachmann teaches students from twelve nations between the ages of 12 and 14 with different religions, languages, cultures and customs. They are all in search of their identity and at the same time the course is being set for their further school career. Mr. Bachmann wants to convey to each child that he or she is valuable.
