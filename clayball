      "text": "**Introduction**\n\nIn the past I could liken my life to a stream -- flowing down hill, drawn by forces greater than the stream, made to flow between the banks, over and around boulders.  During the last six months I have come to view that life as a bolus of damp clay, to be held in my hands and shaped into one lasting figure, a central theme to be chosen and attempted to the exclusion of all others - a unique figure that is to be me.  I must choose.  The attempt itself seems to be more important than its ultimate outcome:  success and failure secondary to the (creative) act.\n\nThis is in part how I view things today, February 5, 1976, as I near the end of medical school; not wishing to be a doctor, but rather a writer.  I suppose that I will pocket the clayball for another year or so.  Hope it doesn’t dry out in that pocket.  Hope my fingers don’t get numb.  Let us pray:  Father in heaven, keep that ole clayball wet will ya? \nOk?\n"

        "text": "Clayball\n\tIntroduction\n\t\tIn the past I could liken my life to a stream -- flowing down hill, drawn by forces greater than the stream, made to flow between the banks, over and around boulders.  During the last six months I have come to view that life as a bolus of damp clay, to be held in my hands and shaped into one lasting figure, a central theme to be chosen and attempted to the exclusion of all others - a unique figure that is to be me.  I must choose.  The attempt itself seems to be more important than its ultimate outcome:  success and failure secondary to the (creative) act.\n\t\tThis is in part how I view things today, February 5, 1976, as I near the end of medical school; not wishing to be a doctor, but rather a writer.  I suppose that I will pocket the clayball for another year or so.  Hope it doesn’t dry out in that pocket.  Hope my fingers don’t get numb.  Let us pray:  Father in heaven, keep that ole clayball wet will ya? Ok?\n\tThe Cripple on the Stairs\n\t\tWhen I hear a hard and a soft foot\n\t\tFumbling, fighting for a hold\n\t\tOn a perfectly regular set of stairs\n\t\tOr what might be a spry sort\n\t\tAdeptly attacking steps on stilts\n\t\tI know it’s nought but the cripple on the stairs.\n\t\t\n\t\tAnd when that perfectly regular set of stairs\n\t\tManages to malign her, with geometric simplicity\n\t\tSets her spinning, toppling to the bottom of the stairs\n\t\tGiving her another chance to challenge if she cares,\n\t\tMy mind, for none other than awareness, marks it...\n\t\tThere’s a cripple on the stairs.\n\t\t\n\t\tA pile of misshapen bones, skin and hair\n\t\tAll collected outside my door at the bottom of the stairs\n\t\tShall I take the prey from the victor fairly won\n\t\tOr shall I let them fight again.\n\t\tMaybe she will have luck and win\n\t\tAnd have defeated a perfectly regular set of stairs.\n\t\t\n\t\tKnowing I don’t really care, I shout\n\t\tHold down the noise out there.\n\t\t\n\tPreacher\n\t\tMy dear, I have something to tell you I fear\n\t\tWhich may shake ya.  A bit of a downer,\n\t\tA come down so to speak\n\t\tI had lunch with your doc today\n\t\tOver dessert he mentioned you were on your way out-a-here.\n\t\tJust a touch of a bug that always wins you see.\n\t\t\n\t\tNot knowing you very well I couldn’t decide\n\t\tWhether to sell you the Eastern dope on cosmic consciousness and\n\t\tThe endless progression of things or\n\t\tThe Western line on how it’s just a step into heaven (if you’ve been good.)\n\t\tIf you don’t buy the old rugged cross bit, and you bought the Blue Cross Plan\n\t\tThen we can hand you the real dope so you can stay high ‘til ya die.\n\t\tDo me a favor an’ give me a clue\n\t\tLet us know how to minister to you.\n\t\t\n\tFrame by Frame\n\t\tI grew up with a rumble in the background\n\t\tThe distant rumble of a passing train\n\t\tIt was endless\n\t\tPersistent\n\t\tBarely aware\n\t\tI ignored its drone\n\t\t\n\t\tThis train’s essence was movement\n\t\tMy world was stationary\n\t\tI felt fixed within it\n\t\tA black train moving, so obviously moving\n\t\tHeld no interest\n\t\tFor it was not part of a permanent world.\n\t\t\n\t\tAs I grew older I glanced toward the train more frequently\n\t\tLooming larger, it never slowed\n\t\tOne year I approached the track \n\t\tAnd discovered during the eye-jittering jarring\n\t\tMy reflection was in every window\n\t\tA  movie reeling by too slowly\n\t\tA nauseating discontinuity\n\t\tThis clickity-clacking train was removing me\n\t\tFrame by frame.\n\tTHE STORY (not my poem)\n\t\tAnd each of the train’s hundred windows had a face.  Passing quickly, it became a strip of film\n\t\tso worked as film does:  one continuous story formed, The Man of A Hundred Faces. I ran\n\t\talongside, so slow (that trick of perception)\n\t\tI ran backwards.  Finally, I was a child.  I looked up in the movie\n\t\ttheater I went to each Saturday afternoon, the screen like a window, and waved to the figure there, an old man\n\t\tat the station just as we pulled away.\n\tDeep Left\n\t\tThe ball is hit\n\t\tTo deep left\n\t\tI run for it\n\t\tLook for it\n\t\tBeat my head\n\t\tCrying.\n\t\t\n\tA Philosophy\n\t\tIt’s not particularly good\n\t\tIt’s not particularly bad\n\t\tBut, I think it’s all there is.\n\t\t\n\t\tPlease     Please    Don’t\n\tA Farewell Letter\n\t\tOnce knew an old lady\n\t\tWho every day expected a letter\n\t\tWhen she turned eighty\n\t\tThe letter arrived.\n\t\tThe same day she died.\n\t\tIt wasn’t the letter which killed.\n\t\tIt was expecting that had kept her alive.\n\t\tIt’s deceiving, but\n\t\tHappiness isn’t receiving.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tI’m Sorry\n\t\tI saw you then and knew you were dying\n\t\tI couldn’t help and wanted to cry\n\t\tI would have grabbed you and hugged you, I would have helped you\n\t\tBut you were helpless, you were hopeless\n\t\tA leukemia worm (one that was really you)\n\t\tHad decided to have a feast\n\t\tat your expense.\n\t\tA final orgy, a final burst of life\n\t\tThe last flicker of flame in a jar\n\t\tIn a flash (a month can be a flash)\n\t\tYour worm had eaten you alive.\n\t\tForgive me for not attending your funeral\n\t\tToo many worms are feeding funerals.\n\t\tI’m sorry.\n\tBeware\n\t\tClocks are made which tick no more\n\t\tThey let you sleep while doing their dying chore\n\t\tI warn you\n\t\tIf you don’t beware\n\t\tThey’ll lop off chunks of you\n\t\tBefore you know it\n\t\tYou’re are not there.\n\tHeads first - Tails later.\n\tHere Today\n\t\tTo say here today and gone tomorrow\n\t\tcauses some some sorrow\n\t\tbut\n\t\tit won’t be so bad\n\t\t‘cause look at my dad\n\t\the’s half way down the drain\n\t\t‘an never has cried of pain\n\t\twhen he does pout\n\t\tin his room\n\t\tit’s of boredom not\n\t\timpending doom.\n\t\t\n\tCongenial Death\n\t\tThose who claim that\n\t\tDeath is incomprehensible\n\t\tMust disregard moments when\n\t\tThey have lain\n\t\tWith lack of thought.\n\t\tEasily they forget\n\t\tEvenings of TV,\n\t\tMarital discontent, and\n\t\tWeeks sleepily spent.\n\t\tThose who fear the\n\t\tIncomprehensible most\n\t\tShould know it best\n\t\tFor in their continuous rest\n\t\tIt has faced them\n\t\tA congenial death.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\tTo Find a Dream\n\t\tNo longer is it my desire to change you\n\t\tNo loner am I dissatisfied\n\t\tYes, dear I’ve mellowed\n\t\tI don’t ask you to fill my dreams of tomorrow\n\t\tNo longer do I tie you to those dreams\n\t\tWhich are me and mine.\n\t\tIt is with those dreams and myself that I must live\n\t\tWith you I will stay for today,\n\t\tTomorrow\n\t\tOr tomorrow\n\t\tOr tomorrow\n\t\tI will go\n\t\tTo find a dream and me.\n\t\t\n\tIs your loving liking? Or lower?\n\tCold is cool - Cool is cold.\n\tA Poem of Wonder\n\t\tWasn’t it wonderful when\n\t\tThe man stood before us and said\n\t\tThat sex is filthy and lewd\n\t\tThat unwed lovers are eternally dead\n\t\tThat sacrilege is painting or viewing a nude.\n\t\tWonder at the cause I must\n\t\tWhy mortal man would abstain from lust.\n\t\tWonder I do\n\t\tIf even warts on his hand he had,\n\t\tIf with each blinking, or bliness he was sure,\n\t\twhile praying, wore gloves in summer.\n\t\tUntil his god the effect could cure\n\t\the perhaps, in grateful measure,\n\t\tforeswore sexual pleasure.\n\t\tOr perhaps it is that he can foresee\n\t\twhile eternally loafing in leisure\n\t\tgreat exploits into sexual pleasure.\n\tSerenatree\n\t\tOh! To be as serene as a tree\n\t\tNothing to bother me\n\t\tExcept wind, rain, lightning, dogs and bad bark\n\t\tThe tree with colored leaves next to me\n\t\tSpotted roots and wilting shoots.\n\t\tOh! If only I could be a tree\n\t\tWith nothing to worry about\n\t\tBut synthesizing ATP\n\t\tAnd keeping my chlorophyll pore a-fill\n\t\tI long for such simplicatree.\n\tHow to Kill a Fly:\n\t\tTo kill a fly, get fairly close with your hand, moving closer only when the fly is cleaning his feet.  Make the final move when he is in this unguarded position.\n\tI am dying\n\t\tThe tire of life has a slow leak and I am miles from a filling station.  Isn’t that sad?\n\tSo many people who fail\n\t\tfail at nothing and yet they\n\t\tcringe and cry as though it was something that they\n\t\thadn’t done.  To me it seems that one might pick a\n\t\tlittle thing easily done or something as big as the\n\t\tworld and important as life if he is going to experience\n\t\tsuch anguish and mental strife at its not doing.\n\t“Secular existentialism is a tragic world view without, however, being pessimistic.”\n\t\tTragedy - a calamity, disaster, or fatal event.  In literature, tragedy refers to any composition\n\t\tComposition with a somber theme carried to a disastrous conclusion.  From a Greek term meaning “goat song,” tragedy involves death just as the sacrifice of goats, totems of primative peoples, did in ancient rituals.\n\tJanet\n\t\tShe is beautiful\n\t\tAnd my Christmas morning mind makes me (nervous?)\n\t\tThere is a bit of fallacious thinking here\n\t\t\twhich needs some work.  I am anxious when thinking about Janet.  I am worried that she will not want to be with me.\n\t\t\tShe appears to be the sort of person (exclusive of sex) that I respect.  On the other hand I want to know her totally.  It is the way that she will not be interested in me -- not consider me her equal -- think my life inane.\n\t\t\tKnowing her will make me reexamine my values.  Reexamine the old dogma that I have developed - much of it conveniently to keep people at a distance.  Now that I want someone close to me can I work myself back to the clean open boy that I used to be.  All of the superficialities which interest many women are possibly even strikes against me or possibly they fall short of her desires -- looks, money, profession.  The important thing for Janet is\n\t\t\tWhat is there in this situation that I find myself wanting Janet so much - even wishing to marry her.\n\t\t\tI think that she and I would bring out the best in each other.\n\t\t\tIt worries me that I am so quickly infatuated - that I seemingly think of people, especially Janet, as possessions, prizes to be won.\n\t\t\tBeing with Janet forces me to reevaluate myself in terms of my use or value to others rather than just to myself.\n\tI am stronger and weaker than you all\n\t\tI must protect you from my love\n\t\tI have no hate for any of you\n\t\tAnd yet I withhold from you because\n\t\tYou could not withstand the pain which\n\t\tAccompanies a free love -- one that asks nothing\n\t\tAnd accepts nothing but love\n\t\tA love bright as the soul\n\t\tAnd one as cold to the dark passions as\n\t\tthe moon’s shadow.\n\t\tYou don’t know about love but are experts on need and its gratification and memorize psychological justifications for this lack of magnamity.\n\tVelvet Texts\n\t\tWith full reign of the tomb\n\t\tfilled with velvet texts folded and pleated into the corners and walls\n\t\tBody\n\t\tSunken in staleness, softly, quietly separated from sun\n\t\tPutrid fumes flow from the rotting head\n\t\tCharacters and capitals scurry,\n\t\tTiny rodent feet silently slipping\n\t\tOver the jelly of cortical remains\n\t\tTheir only sound the crunch crunching of tiny jaws\n\t\tRetrieving sentences and facts stored in pneumonic morsels.\n\t\tBefore the cold came,\n\t\tFacts were eaten from sack lunches and swallowed from coffee cups\n\t\tThe substance of no substance nonnourishing\n\t\tAs the third party of self onlooked.\n\tA Revelation of a Moment’s Mediation\n\t\tWe all assume that life is too tough\n\t\tFor one man to handle alone\n\t\tThat each must own a manual\n\t\tA book, a bible, a string of beads or bones,\n\t\tMust have faith in a Father,\n\t\tOr TM for an hour alone.\n\t\tOh small man rattling my door (Mr. Jehovah’s Witness)\n\t\tGo fuck yourself (or find a whore)\n\t\tShoo, beat it, get away from that door.\n\t\tAnd when I die don’t shake your beads o’er these bones\n\t\tLet me handle it\n\t\tI just want to die on my own.\n\tEpitath for A Doctor’s Son\n\t\tYesterday, a winter storm\n\t\tToday, where are the whitecaps?\n\t\t\t11/5/82 - JMP\n\tInsufficient light\n\t\tIt may be because\n\t\tit comes and goes at\n\t\tnight in insufficient\n\t\tlight or maybe\n\t\tin the day when we\n\t\tlook the other way\n\tMaddness\n\t\tThe delerious\n\t\thave taken it all\n\t\tto serious.\n\tChairs with many legs crashing against the wall of my inside head.\n\tDaughters\n\t\tIf you have a little girl and love her\n\t\tDon’t tell her that love lasts forever\n\t\tTell her not to live for love, rather she should love to live\n\t\tDon’t make for her a world in which she cannot live\n\t\tDon’t have her expect to have what you never could\n\t\tYou decide her death in choosing the lies in which she is to live.\n\t\tMy grandmother kills my mother\n\t\tslowly and so inhumanely\n\t\tthat I almost can\n\t\thate her\n\t\tBut then there was her mother...\n\tA poet should not extol anguish, only depict.\n\tLove is carried by those young enough to bare the load\n\t\tfree temporarily from the weight\n\t\tof growing up or growing old.\n\tGrowing old is to need love\n\t\tbut love is freed of those\n\t\twho solicit with only the passion of fear.\n\tAs we grow old\n\t\tand passionately plead with fear for love with words cold\n\t\treplies, he sells himself not\n\t\twhen asked to be bought.\n\tIs my watch me\n\t\tit cost $100 or little work\n\t\tIs gaudily practical\n\t\tbut keeps excellent time.\n\tThis morning I’m not (but a little)\n\t\tI look and wait for\n\t\tI will be again\n\t\tPlease\n\tSimon and G\n\t\tSimon and G\n\t\tG Simon \n\t\tY not me\n\tWill I settle for\n\t\twriting\n\t\t\tCarolyn?\n\t\t\tcarolyn   carolyn\n\t\t\tCarolyn, Carolyn!

Reexamine the old dogma that I have developed - much of it conveniently to keep people at a distance.  Now that I want someone close to me can I work myself back to the clean open boy that I used to be.  All of the superficialities which interest many women are possibly even strikes against me or possibly they fall short of her desires -- looks, money, profession.

Make the final move when he is in this unguarded position.\n\tI am dying\n\t\tThe tire of life has a slow leak and I am miles from a filling station.  Isn’t that sad?\n\tSo many people who fail\n\t\tfail at nothing and yet they\n\t\tcringe and cry as though it was something that they\n\t\thadn’t done.  To me it seems that one might pick a\n\t\tlittle thing easily done or something as big as the\n\t\tworld and important as life if he is going to experience\n\t\tsuch anguish and mental strife at its not doing.\n\t“Secular existentialism is a tragic world view without, however, being pessimistic.”\n\t\tTragedy - a calamity, disaster, or fatal event.  In literature, tragedy refers to any composition\n\t\tComposition with a somber theme carried to a disastrous conclusion.  From a Greek term meaning “goat song,” tragedy involves death just as the sacrifice of goats, totems of primative peoples, did in ancient rituals.\n\tJanet\n\t\tShe is beautiful\n\t\tAnd my Christmas morning mind makes me (nervous?)\n\t\tThere is a bit of fallacious thinking here\n\t\t\twhich needs some work.  I am anxious when thinking about Janet.  I am worried that she will not want to be with me.\n\t\t\tShe appears to be the sort of person (exclusive of sex) that I respect.  On the other hand I want to know her totally.  It is the way that she will not be interested in me -- not consider me her equal -- think my life inane.\n\t\t\tKnowing her will make me reexamine my values.  Reexamine the old dogma that I have developed - much of it conveniently to keep people at a distance.  Now that I want someone close to me can I work myself back to the clean open boy that I used to be.  All of the superficialities which interest many women are possibly even strikes against me or possibly they fall short of her desires -- looks, money, profession.  The important thing for Janet is\n\t\t\tWhat is there in this situation that I find myself wanting Janet so much - even wishing to marry her.\n\t\t\tI think that she and I would bring out the best in each other.\n\t\t\tIt worries me that I am so quickly infatuated - that I seemingly think of people, especially Janet, as possessions, prizes to be won.\n\t\t\tBeing with Janet forces me to reevaluate myself in terms of my use or value to others rather than just to myself.\n\tI am stronger and weaker than you all\n\t\tI must protect you from my love\n\t\tI have no hate for any of you\n\t\tAnd yet I withhold from you because\n\t\tYou could not withstand the pain which\n\t\tAccompanies a free love -- one that asks nothing\n\t\tAnd accepts nothing but love\n\t\tA love bright as the soul\n\t\tAnd one as cold to the dark passions as\n\t\tthe moon’s shadow.\n\t\tYou don’t know about love but are experts on need and its gratification and memorize psychological justifications for this lack of magnamity.\n\tVelvet Texts\n\t\tWith full reign of the tomb\n\t\tfilled with velvet texts folded and pleated into the corners and walls\n\t\tBody\n\t\tSunken in staleness, softly, quietly separated from sun\n\t\tPutrid fumes flow from the rotting head\n\t\tCharacters and capitals scurry,\n\t\tTiny rodent feet silently slipping\n\t\tOver the jelly of cortical remains\n\t\tTheir only sound the crunch crunching of tiny jaws\n\t\tRetrieving sentences and facts stored in pneumonic morsels.\n\t\tBefore the cold came,\n\t\tFacts were eaten from sack lunches and swallowed from coffee cups\n\t\tThe substance of no substance nonnourishing\n\t\tAs the third party of self onlooked.\n\tA Revelation of a Moment’s Mediation\n\t\tWe all assume that life is too tough\n\t\tFor one man to handle alone\n\t\tThat each must own a manual\n\t\tA book, a bible, a string of beads or bones,\n\t\tMust have faith in a Father,\n\t\tOr TM for an hour alone.\n\t\tOh small man rattling my door (Mr. Jehovah’s Witness)\n\t\tGo fuck yourself (or find a whore)\n\t\tShoo, beat it, get away from that door.\n\t\tAnd when I die don’t shake your beads o’er these bones\n\t\tLet me handle it\n\t\tI just want to die on my own.\n\tEpitath for A Doctor’s Son\n\t\tYesterday, a winter storm\n\t\tToday, where are the whitecaps?\n\t\t\t11/5/82 - JMP\n\tInsufficient light\n\t\tIt may be because\n\t\tit comes and goes at\n\t\tnight in insufficient\n\t\tlight or maybe\n\t\tin the day when we\n\t\tlook the other way\n\tMaddness\n\t\tThe delerious\n\t\thave taken it all\n\t\tto serious.\n\tChairs with many legs crashing against the wall of my inside head.\n\tDaughters\n\t\tIf you have a little girl and love her\n\t\tDon’t tell her that love lasts forever\n\t\tTell her not to live for love, rather she should love to live\n\t\tDon’t make for her a world in which she cannot live\n\t\tDon’t have her expect to have what you never could\n\t\tYou decide her death in choosing the lies in which she is to live.\n\t\tMy grandmother kills my mother\n\t\tslowly and so inhumanely\n\t\tthat I almost can\n\t\thate her\n\t\tBut then there was her mother...\n\tA poet should not extol anguish, only depict.\n\tLove is carried by those young enough to bare the load\n\t\tfree temporarily from the weight\n\t\tof growing up or growing old.\n\tGrowing old is to need love\n\t\tbut love is freed of those\n\t\twho solicit with only the passion of fear.\n\tAs we grow old\n\t\tand passionately plead with fear for love with words cold\n\t\treplies, he sells himself not\n\t\twhen asked to be bought.\n\tIs my watch me\n\t\tit cost $100 or little work\n\t\tIs gaudily practical\n\t\tbut keeps excellent time.\n\tThis morning I’m not (but a little)\n\t\tI look and wait for\n\t\tI will be again\n\t\tPlease\n\tSimon and G\n\t\tSimon and G\n\t\tG Simon \n\t\tY not me\n\tWill I settle for\n\t\twriting\n\t\t\tCarolyn?\n\t\t\tcarolyn   carolyn\n\t\t\tCarolyn, Carolyn!

I am anxious when thinking about Janet.  I am worried that she will not want to be with me.\n\t\t\tShe appears to be the sort of person (exclusive of sex) that I respect.  On the other hand I want to know her totally.  It is the way that she will not be interested in me -- not consider me her equal -- think my life inane.\n\t\t\tKnowing her will make me reexamine my values.  Reexamine the old dogma that I have developed - much of it conveniently to keep people at a distance.  Now that I want someone close to me can I work myself back to the clean open boy that I used to be.  All of the superficialities which interest many women are possibly even strikes against me or possibly they fall short of her desires -- looks, money, profession.  The important thing for Janet is\n\t\t\tWhat is there in this situation that I find myself wanting Janet so much - even wishing to marry her.\n\t\t\tI think that she and I would bring out the best in each other.\n\t\t\tIt worries me that I am so quickly infatuated - that I seemingly think of people, especially Janet, as possessions, prizes to be won.\n\t\t\tBeing with Janet forces me to reevaluate myself in terms of my use or value to others rather than just to myself.\n\tI am stronger and weaker than you all\n\t\tI must protect you from my love\n\t\tI have no hate for any of you\n\t\tAnd yet I withhold from you because\n\t\tYou could not withstand the pain which\n\t\tAccompanies a free love -- one that asks nothing\n\t\tAnd accepts nothing but love\n\t\tA love bright as the soul\n\t\tAnd one as cold to the dark passions as\n\t\tthe moon’s shadow.\n\t\tYou don’t know about love but are experts on need and its gratification and memorize psychological justifications for this lack of magnamity.\n\t\n"

During the last six months I have come to view that life as a bolus of damp clay, to be held in my hands and shaped into one lasting figure, a central theme to be chosen and attempted to the exclusion of all others - a unique figure that is to be me.  I must choose.  The attempt itself seems to be more important than its ultimate outcome:  success and failure secondary to the (creative) act.\n\nThis is in part how I view things today, February 5, 1976, as I near the end of medical school; not wishing to be a doctor, but rather a writer.  I suppose that I will pocket the clayball for another year or so.  Hope it doesn’t dry out in that pocket.  Hope my fingers don’t get numb.  Let us pray:  Father in heaven, keep that ole clayball wet will ya? \nOk?\n"
