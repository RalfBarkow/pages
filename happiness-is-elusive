However, if we want to keep the same level of happiness, then we need an infinitely increasing dose of happy juice, which is not possible. Another way of saying this is that the brain adjusts the level happiness to average \"neutral\" over the medium-run run. \"Good\" signals will push it up temporarily, but only temporarily. The more \"good\" signals it gets in a short period of time, the less sensitive it becomes to good signals and thus settles back to neutral.

It seems to be in vogue these days to claim that such-and-such a behavior has been evolutionarily selected for. (I wonder why... perhaps it's psychologists trying to build up hard-science credibility for their theories by handwaving about evolution.) Humans are great at making up stories to explain \"why\" something evolved the way it did - and they love to make up these stories, because it makes them think they understand what's going on, and provides a pleasing connection with their own personal \"observations about human nature in general\" (words of the original poster at the top of the page). Yet these claims are fundamentally impossible to back up with genuine, direct experimental evidence. One might do a study and find that unhappy people fuck more - but this is not evidence that there is an evolutionary advantage to the transitoriness of happiness. The usefulness of a scientific theory does not lie in how well (we think) it explains the observed data. One can always think up plenty of ways of \"explaining\" some phenomenon, which are to varying degrees pleasing for reasons other than the fact that they fit the data. The real test of a theory is whether it has predictive power, and whether it provides insight beyond \"explaining the data\".

To motivate the creature to acquire yet more even after a few satisfactory hunts, their H levels would have to drop soon after digestion is finished. Evolution would result in rather greedy creatures that are never satisfied. The biggest fish would still want to get bigger because there is no evolutionary advantage to stopping after reaching a plateau (an oversimplification because sometimes there is a practical limit, such as a fat gazell not being able to run from lions).

Happiness is not a state of being as one might suppose, but rather a moment (short or sustained) of realization.  When one realizes that things are good, that equates to happiness.  Too often people are confused by what happiness is.  The best description I can muster is: \"good\".  I say good, because most of society wants euphoria or perfection to be the definition of happiness, but these are incorrect.  Happiness is simple, not complicated, just as good is simple and not complicated.  Perfection and Euphoria are very much complicated and very subjective, and certainly not sustainable.  One does not have to be constantly pushing forward, or constantly looking for some new thing that will bring happiness, but quite the opposite really.  Often times people have to have comparison in order to have realization.  Experiencing or witnessing something horrific, will often lead to the realization of happiness.  Settle for good, and you will find that you will be happy when you realize what you have is not bad.  My conclusion is that happiness is not elusive at all.

Humans are great at making up stories to explain \"why\" something evolved the way it did - and they love to make up these stories, because it makes them think they understand what's going on, and provides a pleasing connection with their own personal \"observations about human nature in general\" (words of the original poster at the top of the page). Yet these claims are fundamentally impossible to back up with genuine, direct experimental evidence. One might do a study and find that unhappy people fuck more - but this is not evidence that there is an evolutionary advantage to the transitoriness of happiness. The usefulness of a scientific theory does not lie in how well (we think) it explains the observed data. One can always think up plenty of ways of \"explaining\" some phenomenon, which are to varying degrees pleasing for reasons other than the fact that they fit the data. The real test of a theory is whether it has predictive power, and whether it provides insight beyond \"explaining the data\".

Too often people are confused by what happiness is.  The best description I can muster is: \"good\".  I say good, because most of society wants euphoria or perfection to be the definition of happiness, but these are incorrect.  Happiness is simple, not complicated, just as good is simple and not complicated.  Perfection and Euphoria are very much complicated and very subjective, and certainly not sustainable.  One does not have to be constantly pushing forward, or constantly looking for some new thing that will bring happiness, but quite the opposite really.  Often times people have to have comparison in order to have realization.  Experiencing or witnessing something horrific, will often lead to the realization of happiness.  Settle for good, and you will find that you will be happy when you realize what you have is not bad.  My conclusion is that happiness is not elusive at all.
