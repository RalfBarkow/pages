This form of remote working — in many cases enforced by the isolation economy — is seen as the new norm. The company is driven by guiding principles which are stated and enforced in both recruitment and promotion. Power is distributed to where it is needed. Teams will often swarm around problems; leadership is transient in nature and leaders will arise to fit the problem. In this world, hierarchy is unimportant and few care about the top-floor office or the status symbols of power. Outcome not output matters. What motivates people are customer and societal outcomes. The projects undertaken always consider the wider community and sustainability is not a buzz word but a core belief. In support of this, a deep understanding of supply chains is considered essential, therefore these tend to be modelled as the company holds itself responsible for its entire supply chain. Ethics also matter a lot and drive external communication; they are not an add-on. Awareness of the market is systemic (throughout the organization) and not the function of a sole leader but of everyone. To train people, the company uses scenarios and gameplay, usually online. The idea of EVE online being a training tool for management is not an alien concept. The company expects that AI will complement humans, replacing some tasks and augmenting some functions. It also considers the future of the company to be currently one of growth with positive times ahead. – [https://leadingedgeforum.turtl.co/story/on-industrialization-a-technology-driven-path-to-the-next-gen-organization/page/7/2 leadingedgeforum]"
