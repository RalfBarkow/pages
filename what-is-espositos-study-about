Furthermore, the plausibilization on the basis of historical evidence, which is necessary due to the high level of abstraction of this functional determination, is missing. In her essay, Esposito largely succeeds in avoiding the impositions of argumentative speech. On the whole, cultural-historical justifications for the fact that \"fictional literature\" has been able to provide \"orientation in the thicket of uncertainty\" since the second half of the 17th century are dispensed with. Occasionally, the essay makes sweeping references such as \"one thinks only of Shakespeare\" (16), \"We are thinking here of La Princesse des Clèves, but also of the works of Daniel Defoe or of Richardson's Pamela\" (17, note 10), or \"one thinks only of Pascal\" (40); but neither is it explained here exactly what the reader is supposed to think of, nor are the passages named that the author had in mind. Literary historical assessments are at best on the level of nonspecific statements such as \"Even at the beginning of the era of the 'bourgeois novel,' Walter Scott allowed himself to use historical facts to create fictions, and the historical novel has always worked very well\" (77)."

However, the concept of probability finds application in quite different contexts of discussion beyond this, e.g., in rhetorical and poetological contexts. A short list of common uses of \"probability\" would include, in addition to \"subjective\" hypothesis probability and \"objective\" event probability: (c) a rhetorical concept of probability, for which \"probability\" is the credibility of a statement in the sense of the confirmation of the statement by generally accepted and authoritatively supported opinions; (d) a poetological concept of probability, for which \"probability\" is the correspondence of a literary representation to our (scientific, anthropological, historical, etc.) knowledge of the world; (e) a poetic concept of probability, for which \"probability\" is the correspondence of a literary representation to our (scientific, anthropological, historical, etc.) knowledge of the world. ) world knowledge; (e) the decision-theoretical concept of probability, for which \"probability\" in the context of a theory of rational action is a degree of reasonable subjective conviction."

One knows that, like Don Quixote, one should not confuse the world of fictions with the real world, and this is what we want to teach our children. But if someone says that something is objectively probable, we are unlikely to think him naive, even though the status of this objective probability is quite similar in our eyes. (71)"

      "text": "The parallelization of fiction and probabilism aims at a critique of probability theory, though Esposito often does not distinguish her critique of probability theory from her critique of the application of probability theory in diverse social contexts. Esposito's notion of \"probabilistic fiction\" (86) points out that the results of probability theory are as fictional as the fictional world constructed in a novel. Economic theory, in particular, would be subject to a \"probabilistic fiction\" if it did not recognize that \"statistics and stochastic[] procedures\" are, like fictional texts, \"themselves forms of fiction\" (121). According to Esposito, the \"fictionality\" of the results of probability theory, which is largely obscured in the economic and social sciences, leads economists in particular to confuse the world of probabilistic \"fictions\" with the real world and leads to an overestimation of the probability calculus and to exaggerated expectations about the predictability and plannability of social developments."

The proverb concurs: Sometimes things turn out differently than one thinks. But why is this fact an argument for the fictional character of the probability calculus? The everyday examples Esposito employs in this context do not make it any easier for the reader to follow her reasoning about the fictional character of probability theory: \"A hungry diner who orders half a chicken in a restaurant and then gets an empty plate while his neighbor is served a whole one is likely to be annoyed, even though he could tell himself that, statistically speaking, they are both sitting in front of half a chicken\" (10). Of course, if the probability of getting a chicken at Esposito's restaurant has a value of 0.5, this does not mean that the restaurant patron should expect to get half a chicken on his next visit: If an objective probability of 0.5 is meant, then he has no good reason to be sure; and if a subjective probability is meant, then \"0.5\" means nothing more than that the diner gives the arrival of his broiler a fifty-fifty chance."

One knows that, like Don Quixote, one should not confuse the world of fictions with the real world, and this is what we want to teach our children. But if someone says that something is objectively probable, we are unlikely to think him naive, even though the status of this objective probability is quite similar in our eyes. (71)"

        "text": "The parallelization of fiction and probabilism aims at a critique of probability theory, though Esposito often does not distinguish her critique of probability theory from her critique of the application of probability theory in diverse social contexts. Esposito's notion of \"probabilistic fiction\" (86) points out that the results of probability theory are as fictional as the fictional world constructed in a novel. Economic theory, in particular, would be subject to a \"probabilistic fiction\" if it did not recognize that \"statistics and stochastic[] procedures\" are, like fictional texts, \"themselves forms of fiction\" (121). According to Esposito, the \"fictionality\" of the results of probability theory, which is largely obscured in the economic and social sciences, leads economists in particular to confuse the world of probabilistic \"fictions\" with the real world and leads to an overestimation of the probability calculus and to exaggerated expectations about the predictability and plannability of social developments."

The proverb concurs: Sometimes things turn out differently than one thinks. But why is this fact an argument for the fictional character of the probability calculus? The everyday examples Esposito employs in this context do not make it any easier for the reader to follow her reasoning about the fictional character of probability theory: \"A hungry diner who orders half a chicken in a restaurant and then gets an empty plate while his neighbor is served a whole one is likely to be annoyed, even though he could tell himself that, statistically speaking, they are both sitting in front of half a chicken\" (10). Of course, if the probability of getting a chicken at Esposito's restaurant has a value of 0.5, this does not mean that the restaurant patron should expect to get half a chicken on his next visit: If an objective probability of 0.5 is meant, then he has no good reason to be sure; and if a subjective probability is meant, then \"0.5\" means nothing more than that the diner gives the arrival of his broiler a fifty-fifty chance."
