A sat down with the team for nearly half a year, sketching object designs on the whiteboard, writing it down in a document, refining it, writing it down, refining it, and so on. In the end we had a 120 page architecture document which was quite sound - but not a single line of code. Guess, how the story goes on: We were late (of course) and expanded the team. The new team members managed to get into the ideas in a very short time, because we had great documentation. Yet, we were not able to meet reasonable time-to-market requirements and half a year later the project was canceled. ",

However, over the course of the next year, there was a steady stream of microcoders and software developers and contractors and new staff who needed to know about the thing, and it saved me many precious hours to be able to say, \"read this document first, then ask me about any parts you need to know more on.\" Write once, read many.
