We've wondered and researched, we've been inspired and shifted practice. Our DiG experience only amplified this vision and our momentum. The difference was in experiencing the learning framework as a learner, not an educator. Instead of simply learning about the framework, we experienced the framework. "

The best way to explain the DiG learning framework to teachers was to let them feel it, to experience it themselves – so we did. In order to bring the DiG learning framework to our learners, our staff needed to experience this powerful learning journey first. "

They created artefacts that unleashed their creative genius, they shared with vulnerability and trust. Our teachers felt what we had felt. They too felt something that they couldn’t simply un-feel. "
