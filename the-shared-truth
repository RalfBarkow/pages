We've wondered and researched, we've been inspired and shifted practice. Our DiG experience only amplified this vision and our momentum. The difference was in experiencing the learning framework as a learner, not an educator. Instead of simply learning about the framework, we experienced the framework. "

The best way to explain the DiG learning framework to teachers was to let them feel it, to experience it themselves - so we did. In order to bring the DiG learning framework to our learners, our staff needed to experience this powerful learning journey first. "

We pondered how this learning framework might translate into the classroom; we knew we wanted it to. Thompson says, as we awaken wonder in ourselves, we awaken it in others. As we research, we become inspired, as we journey we are empowered as meaning-makers. Once you feel it, you can’t un-feel it; once you experience it you can’t un-experience it. This was a journey we must bring to our learners and letting out staff experience the unforgettable was the next step."
