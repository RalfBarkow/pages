[online]. Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. [Zugriff am: 3 August 2021]. Verfügbar unter: http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.2.20857.67687\n> This instructional guide to research-based learning (RBL) in the seminar format offers lecturers and instructors a first opportunity to engage with research-based learning from the concept through to planing and practical implementation. The first part defines research-based learning according to its main characteristics. The second part then offers advice on planning and preparing courses in the RBL format. In the third part, we seek to distinguish RBL from other, related concepts with a view to offering further ideas on how to link research to teaching in class. The guide also contains a collection of working materials and methods that have proved useful in the implementation of RBL-courses. Our recommendations here are based on four years of workshops and observations with in qualifying junior academic staff and student tutors in the principles of research-based learning, as well as the preliminary findings from our German Ministry of Education and Research funded research project \"ForschenLernen\" (Federal Grant No. 01PB14004B)\n"
