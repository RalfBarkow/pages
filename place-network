We can all recognize some common failures: front porches that feel too exposed to use; balconies that sit empty because they are too shallow; front lawns that look nice but are never actively used, resulting in a waste of valuable space. Re-envisioning them as room-like spaces helps us to correct the deficiencies of all these typologies. Then we might be able to identify remedies — for example, put up a permeable fence on the porch; make the balcony at least 2m deep (the original Alexandrian Pattern [[Six-Foot Balcony]], APL 167); or enclose a front yard with a picket fence, to make it a more protected area. The goal is to create a tapestry of psychologically well-defined places. The street transitions into the partially fenced-in front yard, then into the partially fenced-in porch, then to the house entrance, and to interior rooms.
