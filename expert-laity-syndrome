The shortening of the more comprehensive disaster protection to a technical-instrumental fire and accident protection, sensuously tangibly symbolized in the firefighting system, ideally nestled to the emergence of this figuration and promoted the coming together of engineers, technicians and civil protectors. The stability of this coalition was further enhanced by the fact that all participants could benefit from the long tradition of accident and occupational safety (cf. BOLDT 1980) and the apparent neutrality of technical protection research: Accident, disaster and civil protection research upgraded themselves via their humanitarian claim and the mutual scientification of their arguments, without having to consider and discuss political or social aspects. Although such a radicalized division of labor inevitably leads to powerful expert castes and functional elites that can easily evade the understanding and control of the population, no one thinks about this as long as the contributions to the overall execution based on the division of labor function effectively. Only in moments of their failure does one become painfully aware of the feet of clay on which the bargained-for comforts stand, and how much greater one's own damage becomes when the abilities to cope with damage, the ingrained disaster culture, are lost to specialists."
