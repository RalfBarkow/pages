Neither is abstract or academic - but they are **analytical**, do theorise, do seek performable patterns.\n- Both are **life stories**: of a person and of many people, activists and others, in times of turmoil, deepening concern and transition; stories of travelling of a generation and **across generations**. These are not cookbooks, but part of the travelling equipment of folks living the one life that they have.\n- Both are prospective **histories**; prospector’s histories. Both are aimed at deep historical change, radical modes of production - the present work necessarily more radical than LTW.\n"
