      "text": "We host sites mostly for the hosting experience. My experimental amazon web server is getting more avantgarde by the day. The above index is hosted on Urbit for kisses. Practical jokes are proof of simplicity. And also that the person pulling them has a lot of time on their hands: I scrape signs of life on this server manually from the terminal while wearing a codebase that can fit on a tee shirt. \n<p>There is a neighborhood roster lying around here somewhere but I thought it would be interesting to just be able to see everyone's subdomains. I was tired of social media being a place where you have to know people who know people to get the algorithm to get to know you well enough to discover the content you know and love. It feels like dating. \n<p>\nI think a good tool works the first time you use it the same way it does the 100th time you use it. Maybe it works faster or maybe you can get it to do tricks. But the use value of said thing does not decrease or increase with growth. Computers are not lawn mowers. Lawnmowers do not strive for wholeness with the lawn. People buy astroturf or go golfing when they want to fuck with lawns. But maybe an argument for the political potential emerging technology lies somewhere in here, in this refusal to get off the lawn; the urgency of not wanting the party to stop badly enough to mobilize...\n<p>\nI think a lot about Hurricane Sandy in my wheelings and dealings in Silicon Valley. It was like we were so acclimated to crisis in this totally asymmetrical fallout of 2008, that when immediate disaster hit all the infrastructure had already been developed. For all the damage that was done, I recall volunteer efforts like a well oiled machine. Even the Red Cross joked that the activists were taking their jobs. \n<p>\nA decade after Occupy, our contributions to democracy could mean more or less. It depends on what side of the insurrection you're on: I think if you're working for the DNC then something happened in Zuccotti park, if you're working in the media, if you're trying to write a progressive sounding pitch for your startup...I think the Movement of the Squares would constitute, I don't know, a moment, a turning point in the political economy. In which case, I might have to reluctantly claim a degree of fractional ownership over the flash mob violently escalated to \"insurrection\" Jan 6 of last year. Donald Trump didn't come up with that. Millennials came up with that.\n<p>\nSo on this site you might have noticed search doesn't work good for the things you're searching for. Nobody is going to fix that. The point is to change the language. You can't do that if you're trying to dispatch from search because presumably you have a datacenter, and database admin, to make sure the values remain consistent regardless of whether or not they're relevant. And so we end up with more rocket science and less community service, even though if you look at the more reliable digital infrastructures-- reliable the way wikipedia is reliable, or [[Craigslist]] is reliable-- you'll notice that not only is the language robust, but that very little management or maintenance or development is required to keep it robust. Because the ways of communicating through those terminals are consistent. And that a kid could do it. \n<p>\nWe want to go somewhere where everybody knows our name and we want to be able to change our minds when we what we know goes by any other name. We want to discover new content and we want to be able to revisit old work because history is fertilizer. And we want to be able to communicate without having to pick up every word as if we're handling it with tweezers. (If you're not cancelled by now, you're probably not conscious and you should be cancelled)\n<p>\nAutonomy is a solution to complexity not necessarily to be confused with Manifest Destiny. The problem of complexity is not the management of complexity, but maybe wholeness or the revelation of wholeness as a system undergoes change. On searching and sorting: learn to distinguish mechanical and cultural interpretation by not having a search function that doesn't involve gambling. \n<p>\n[[Give Until it Feels Good]] is a tutorial based on an [[Adrian Piper]] wall installation called \"Everything Will be Taken Away\". For the Museum of Modern Art's largest retrospective exhibition of any living artist, Piper's drawing demonstrates the mechanics of linking in all its Boolean \n<p> \nSimply these pages are hosted on a private cloud: they fly too close to the sun on wings made of JSON, exposing the internet in all its perpetual vulnerability, finding it right in order to make it work for good. Data loss is probably immanent. That's cool. Maybe freedom is slow. (That makes Wiki just another word for left to lose.) \n</p>\n<p>\nI use amazon web server to host this site and sites that belong to others using Wildcard DNS. You can barely smell the corporate monopoly: from logging in with google and paying tithes to the lord service fees are still less than what I donate to wikipedia: around 2 hexadecimal dollars. (0x$2.56)\n</p>\nI don't usually like to test my friends except in production, so as long as AWS is public transit and costs the same we should see what happens trying to run it 40 deep. Y Scarcity in the cloud is weird. \n<p>\nClaimed sites have a name at the lower left. Those are harder for the taking than unclaimed sites. If you're under the age of ten you'll probably figure it out fasterer. \n"

The point is to change the language. You can't do that if you're trying to dispatch from search because presumably you have a datacenter, and database admin, to make sure the values remain consistent regardless of whether or not they're relevant. And so we end up with more rocket science and less community service, even though if you look at the more reliable digital infrastructures-- reliable the way wikipedia is reliable, or craigslist is reliable-- you'll notice that not only is the language robust, but that very little management or maintenance or development is required to keep it robust.

        "text": "We host sites mostly for the hosting experience. My experimental amazon web server is getting more avantgarde by the day. The above index is hosted on Urbit for kisses. Practical jokes are proof of simplicity. And also that the person pulling them has a lot of time on their hands: I scrape signs of life on this server manually from the terminal while wearing a codebase that can fit on a tee shirt. \n<p>There is a neighborhood roster lying around here somewhere but I thought it would be interesting to just be able to see everyone's subdomains. I was tired of social media being a place where you have to know people who know people to get the algorithm to get to know you well enough to discover the content you know and love. It feels like dating. \n<p>\nI think a good tool works the first time you use it the same way it does the 100th time you use it. Maybe it works faster or maybe you can get it to do tricks. But the use value of said thing does not decrease or increase with growth. Computers are not lawn mowers. Lawnmowers do not strive for wholeness with the lawn. People buy astroturf or go golfing when they want to fuck with lawns. But maybe an argument for the political potential emerging technology lies somewhere in here, in this refusal to get off the lawn; the urgency of not wanting the party to stop badly enough to mobilize...\n<p>\nI think a lot about Hurricane Sandy in my wheelings and dealings in Silicon Valley. It was like we were so acclimated to crisis in this totally asymmetrical fallout of 2008, that when immediate disaster hit all the infrastructure had already been developed. For all the damage that was done, I recall volunteer efforts like a well oiled machine. Even the Red Cross joked that the activists were taking their jobs. \n<p>\nA decade after Occupy, our contributions to democracy could mean more or less. It depends on what side of the insurrection you're on: I think if you're working for the DNC then something happened in Zuccotti park, if you're working in the media, if you're trying to write a progressive sounding pitch for your startup...I think the Movement of the Squares would constitute, I don't know, a moment, a turning point in the political economy. In which case, I might have to reluctantly claim a degree of fractional ownership over the flash mob violently escalated to \"insurrection\" Jan 6 of last year. Donald Trump didn't come up with that. Millennials came up with that.\n<p>\nSo on this site you might have noticed search doesn't work good for the things you're searching for. Nobody is going to fix that.
