In some major\ndemocracies, people have even stormed\nparliament buildings, claiming the elections\ndid not reflect the true\nwishes of the people.

It's true\nthat when most of us hear the word democracy,\nwe think of elections and which political party\nwe’ll vote for. But elections\nare not enough to create a democracy. There's another\ncrucial ingredient that makes democracy democratic. That crucial\ningredient is a shield, a shield of basic rights and freedoms\nthat protects you as a citizen,\nno matter which party is elected\ninto office. And irrespective of whether you're\npart of the majority or the minority of voters. In a liberal democracy, if your liberal rights are compromised\nby the government, then an independent\nlegal system should have the ability\nto protect you and to make sure\nthat the rulers also abide by the rules. The same goes\nfor the press. An independent press,\nlike individuals, should be able\nto raise its voice and expose\na breach of rights or to criticize\nthe rulers’ corruption or illegal actions\nif and when they happen. This is why independent\npress and powerful legal systems are crucial\nfor democracy. These are the tools\nthat democracy uses to guarantee\nyour shield of rights, even if you are part\nof a minority."

      "text": "The second common\nmisconception about democracy\nis that democracy simply means\n‘majority rules’. So let's consider\nthe following scenario. Imagine that 70%\nof a country's citizens votes for party X. After the elections,\nParty X legally decides the remaining 30%\nof citizens A.K.A ‘the minority’, cannot keep any of their\nprivate possessions. All their private property\nis taken from them and given to the 70%\nof citizens who voted\nfor the ruling party. Would you consider this a democratic decision? Well,\ntechnically, it's not. Here's why. In a democracy, the winner doesn't\ntake it all. If the winning party\ntakes it all then it's no longer\na democracy! The most precious aspect\nof liberal democracy apart\nfrom the right to vote, is that it\nlimits the power of the winning party\nby having politicians respect a specific\nshield of rights and the freedoms\nof each citizen. Even if that citizen did not vote for them. Winston Churchill once said “No one pretends that democracy is perfect\nor all-wise. Democracy is the worst\nform of government  – except for all those other forms\nthat have been tried.” What do you think? How about we take a vote on it?"

the the okay bios small is a the library for bi informatics is part of the by informatics Foundation um and uh of course it's a it's a tool only to help there are already hundreds of thousands and by informatic tools used every day by by informaticians and so this is a kind of tool that I developed to to kind of of uh speed up the the work I had to do uh using farro um what I this is a bit of of introduction because it's kind of comp I know it's Friday everyone is a bit tired but we're going to talk about molecular biology but uh no I I will try to to make it easier I'm not a molecular biologist or geneticist but I will try to explain As I understood so the the area has a bit of of context which was the development of of the human Chom project um and I want to to I I really like to this this graphic because it shows the the what happened after the completion of the the partial completion of the human genome um which uh I know that in the UI exist each of the millions of dollars which cost at the point which was kindly draft and and through the x x uh we have the the years that it takes it actually started before but at 2003 it was completed by 19% but uh of course the that people didn't know that it was partially completed so and at some point in 2008 there was a a a drop which was when the sequencing centers started to switched to a new technology which is called nggs for Next Generation sequencing the previous one was was called senture and this and this development of a new technology like really make the the cost of sequencing really cheap um and the amount of data explode actually because uh we we passed from analyzing just one or a group of genes in an organism to analy thousands of them uh and dis enable to to new areas like functional genomics just to the the functions of of genes uh in a more contextual way with more data like I kind of develop so and at some point this this will impact in what's called personalized medicine which is uh kind of when when the technology became accessible to all of us at a really cheap cost and and this this will be like a another huge uh uh development of of the technology but this is like uh one of the one of the driven factors Through The Years um so but from uh by the way the the whole cost of the the project the for the just the human gen on Project project costed 10 billion of dollars so that's is the funding we are talking about so but to to go to the other side what what's I really like this one because it summarize uh well enough without too much complexity how how what's happening inside of us so each uh each cell in our organism contains a nucleus and the nucleus has a its own copy of of the genome and basically the genome is all of our organisms DNA and and we could see that it's organized in chromosome of course and and DNA is a a chain of small molecules which are called nucleotides and nucle is coming of course that we represent with the four letters which are AC DT and they came in pairs um in two strands uh and if you they they came like always like a is pair with G and uh C is pair CTO is paired with with she and if you ever need to remember this you could use alant taring and car G because like easier to memorize it's like a neot technic yes and um also this is basically the the the structure and the kind of of objects that we manage is at the very basic level is is managing this kind of of of molecules and for the now for the more functional part is how how does it really overing simplification of course how does it work so we have a two strands of DNA and and we have a a process which is called transcription and transcription is like essential to life it's the first step of gene expression and and it consists of of translating copying the the DNA into RNA which is another kind of of molecule and and this is like the the beginning of of of the Gen expression and when the cell need to do something like it locates the right position at the at the DNA and it starts to to transcri to transcribe and then the there is another process which is called translation and the translation is takes the the RNA by three and this is like it's called a codone and this translate into amino acids and which together together they build a protein so of course that there is a other type of RNA like noncoding re which has a other type of function like regulatory functions and and there are hundred of of for example non-coding RNA but this is like a kind of basic uh overview um so we have uh in in the library we could like represent this these operations we we could use uh we start from a a sample sequence and we just converted in an object and the object has a read of course it shows the second less length on the DNA alphabets and DNA alphabets as uh it has its own uh it's own hierarchy of of uh properties because every every kind of of alphabet like DNA or RNA has different codes and um from there we could like from the sequence we could transcribe um and um it has another kind of alphabet which is RNA alphabet and we could back transcribe which is this is actually called complimentary DNA but in for our case the thing is that uh we have like a mismatch between what happens in Vivo in vitro and in silico so not all is not all the the operations has which happens in real life in biology has like a sense to to represent in the computer so we are like selecting which which operations that uh we we perform um but of course that biology is way way more complicated and of course we have the the complement the the alant taring and car thing and this like lets you to represent the two strands to the to the complimentary sequence and we have of course the reverse complement because the DNA is read in one strand is read in One Direction and from the other Str is read u in another Direction and finally we can translate to to the protein sequence so as it's read by three you see that the the protain the amino acids are only three for that sequence uh so I we we have also sequence utilities we could calculate the these are some sequence statistics like the CC content and the CC is a value that uh researchers look um because uh DNA is the nucleotides the for nucle is uh without selective pressures or or any kind of of of mutational event there is a they are equally distributed in the genome so when you have an over representation of of CC of one CTO content you could have like a contamination of samples and like that you could uh check if your your sample procedure was correct um this is a a a measure that should be like really low standard and we could of course plot with help of um Ral um and we have another because in the end this is all thermodynamics and and we could like get the molecular weight there are algorithm for that and the local complexity is a is another is another measure which LEDs uh to the determine the the varant nucleotid composition and of course the a letters also to determine if the sequence quality and we have also that because sequences nucle could could be um represented by by there could be like many position because there are sometimes there are the sequencing machines they give errors and you could have for a position you could have different possibilities uh um of course we have some algorithm for for pattern matching which is counting some Sub Sub subsequences on the long on some check some uh measures uh which are pretty standard in the in the bionformatics world and of course that we could like we could plot the the distribution of the fast f is is the basic format in BIO informatics it's a PL text it was developed in the 70s but it's still alive today um the thing is that um of course have sequence alignment but the thing I I want to tell that you will see like faster format is one format if you ever like want to experiment this but there are multiple formats in B forat it's not like a an area which is like um uh satellites or or the super collider where you have just one type of data here you have a millions of organisms and you have the also the instrumentation methods for each one of the each of the organism and each species has its part particularities and and if you combine everything together and you have different teries of study like transcriptomics which St studies the RNA and you have genomics which is focused in the DNA and proteomics and metabolomics and you mix all of that you have a a a very Tous field with multiple databases so it's not like you have a a single format you have a a multitude of formats and there are some kind of of lack of of coordination efforts to to join this together so it's very common it's very complex because biological organisms are really complex so this is one of comment I wanted to to make so sequence alignment is a big field in the in bi informatics and we have seen the if you have seen the r presentation we have seen and this is are these are more the for the biological explanation these are kind of matrices to to represent the the history of the actually they represent an hypothesis of the the evolution of of of multiple organisms on each line it represents an individual and each column is called a seat a site and and it represent the the what happen in in an specific position of the of a chromosome uh and you will see that there are some gaps and there are some regions that are more like similar and those are represents like conserved regions where the function of a gene was like positively selected um by the the evolution of species and there are some gaps where where you have a very VAR variant um like mutation and you can study why there is some mutations there what what happened in the evolutionary history um of course that that you could build finally an alignment but the thing is like mostly they are like you could have a sequence of study and and you could make the the query remotely um and like compare with different like from nucleotides through to protain or nucleo against nucleotides you have different kind of queries and you will do that like this like local search and you could use a other software for for doing alignment this is the sample input for for aligning the the FAS sequence of the coid genome um this is all implemented with with wrappers because everything that is already researched and we have also a local aligner implemented which implements needl man W which is a technique of dynamic programming uh which uh implements a variant of alignment which is um Global alignment which align end to end a sequence there are there are other technique which used by blast which is the the local aler which only looks given a wider sequence only looks the the specific part that you are interested so uh we have an implementation of of of these algorithms basically a matrix uh scoring use a matrix scoring and Trace back to to optimize the the pro the the problem of of sequence matching and and we could like Implement very more complex pipelines uh for example for for retrieving all the the sequences for for the co for example we could just with the identifiers by now there are eight millions of identifiers of sequences of the the Co genome and we can align them um and pass them just in a few few lines of code um and of course that we we could have other we we have other functionality like getting consensus sequences which is the most represented uh nucleo that a position we have a repeats like analyzing most of the DNA is repeated and we don't know yet the the function of of this it was called chunk DNA but through the years we we are realizing that it's not actually shank is that we don't know what he doing and U but uh yes some some type of is called also fossil DNA because it so that it has some function in the past of our history but now we don't know and codon tables which are useful for translating the protain and this is all implemented in the use following the nomenclature of UPAC which is an Institute of applied chemistry and of course i' I shown the the alphabet features and records are like more like a high level representations of of the information of of sequences and we have H also just one liner to download genomes of the species that you want the genomes are also versioned and um rubers we have rubers for population genetics um links and calop is are is a is a tool for for working with the Next Generation sequences which is a lot way more data represents the world Genome of an organism and blast of course and clal for multiple sequence alignment and structure for po population stratification like determining the the structure of of a population without previous knowledge um and have shape it for sham imputation and HH s is for for hidden Market model profiling like youle search with the algorithm you could search the homology the the thing that with with bionformatics is that that you use this transfer of know Knowledge from other species to know what your species what your sequence is doing like how which function does it have so you you you try to use the the to transfer the knowledge from other species to to to the one that you're studing so there are some many ways to do that and one is sequence similarity and the other is using hidden Mark of models which try to look for patterns in in in re of of a sequence and we have other aligners and we have formatters to to format the the all the the multiple kind of data we could have and faster format and shin bank and other formats for population genetics um and we have parser for all these um for XML and giving B the shin bank and the SBA and this is actually like a kind point of entry to the library if you want to experiment once um because the entrance Library basically the whole thing is organized in primary and secondary databases and the primary databases is that where the the place where researchers upload the sequences like a kind of archive and they they perform some kind of basic annotations but they are not really well created is somewhat created and this is organized globally in three data centers we will say that when is from the chin bank it's located in United States and the a which is um here in Europe anded Kingdom um the the is from Japan so these are synchronized every day and they contain millions of millions of trillions of of nucle nucleotides and of course that you have a multiple everything is accessible from from the from the library um with just a a kind um buy on trust client like you will have access to all of these database like some of of some of them are very specific like uh like cancer chromosomes of or cancer bionformatics or or I don't know for for protonics or taxonomies so this is like a huge um area um so this is kind of the high overview level overview and we have some application that through the years and in this case for example one one applic the real application that we have used uh the library is uh to determine this is complex to explain so give me a second so uh the idea is that you could have a um uh some breeds that are composed actually that this happen in animal genetics and you kind of compose a breed to to have a um positive uh selection of some features for example resistance to to heat in in tropical areas and so we want to know here the the goal of This research if was the the uh particular region of of the chromosome 23 which is called the the the I sorry I forgot the name the major isoc compatibility index uh which encodes for for sheins um uh which uh is they are suspected to have a response for adaptive immune adaptive immune response and this is linked to to resistance to Tropical environments also we determine it with the goal what to determine which uh if if which was uh the which one of the was the ancestry which has most impact in the in the development of this brangus CLE which is a combination of Brahman and Angus and so we we came to the conclusion that brayman was the the the fer that has most impact in the for for this particular characteristic and and this was like a bit more fun which uh there was a a call from a prosecutor and he has an hypothesis that uh the arrested the suspected which was arrested uh from a crimes um the victim has a dog and the the shoes of the of the suspected has some kind of FAL material and the pr pru hypothesis was to to see if if they match so we kind of did a um Phil Geographic analysis with using these databases to to help in forensic in this particular fory case um so we developed a kind of workflow for for this kind of thing which is now uh which is now kind of of in the public was was in the public I because this one like original to to check because from from FAL material the DNA is very degradated and it's difficult to to see to extract some some information from there and we have a runs of of of osity which is um kind of measureing the brething levels and this gives a measure of um of uh health risk in population um so in in this analysis it's a bit more complicated but the the analysis it's was that using this this metric which is called runs of osity which are in alls that from from one generation to another uh that um gives some some some kind of indication of of the of the the possibility of of having a a population which is more has more health risk of of in because of in breathing which is maing of closely related individuals um so this of course there is the paper of of the library bios motto itself and we we publish it and we have some some benchmarks to to measure the against other other libraries and we have outperform uh in the for example in the puring of of big XML files we oper from other libraries um recently I immigrated everything because this was done with ptit parser one and now I'm using Petit parser 2 which pretty fast actually um okay so everything is available here in in in the the repository and thank you now you have some questions if I understand correctly have those Triplets of the encoding asss uh the number of possible amocs is less than all the possible combinations so that means that if you have a sequence you should probably be able to determine if you have it in the correct order or you need toe confidence uh you are asking about if the the translation from RNA to protain you have a sequence of DNA which inodes amino acids yes and we have only 12 acids which means that um some of them do not make sense so if you uh have a sequence and then you see that there is more combinations that make sense then those that do not make sense and if you reverse it it's in opposite and you may be quite sure that you have the sequence in the right order is it correct um actually with the the thing with the comparative Chic like comparing sequences um uh which is kind of the the part of the alignment of alignment of sequences is uh like to determine that the what's called hology and when like you see what's uh what for each position is it's like is it's not that it doesn't make sense but you like you need to uh to like Rec accommodate the the ordering so to see because of the the the sampling method and the the procedure of of getting the from the material the the DNA material to to the machines is like a very prone error and could have like multiple errors of of lectures of reading um um from this is not is not that doesn't make sense but the most part that you need to to like realign this like to to see which sites has more hology like is like common ancestry information with with one with another so uh so it's kind of uh that you need to to start with a hypothesis of what you are looking for so this is why you align specific regions against more complete annotated or reference genomes um this is the point where most people start uh so this is very for humans is really well annotated so if you are going to Su the some human disease or everything has each position is is really well annotated and there are lot of of data supporting especially where where there is positions of where there are mutations um for Animals it's more complicated because there are not so much funding for for them there are actually a lot but not so much as as human so and especially when the the mutations related with with cancer uh for the cancer informatics is is the getting the most funding actually but um yes it's kind of that is kind of the point of of start okay in in informatics there is a lot of uses of computational notebooks at this with python for example python I know I I don't know if you have experience with with teaching or creating let's say educational material and who do you see the use of computational notebooks uh in this case for example for for bios or what's like kind of the picture of using computational notebooks in bi informatics using smart work yeah um the the area that that you're asking about I think that you're your asking is about um exploratory B informatics which is kind of different of confirmatory but uh when you're doing the explorator what I've seen of using not uh notebooks like Jupiter and everything is that people usually start like like man but when the workflow diverge like you need to really have need to do multiple parallel experiments but because you are like exploring and you need to have a different workflow path and it doesn't scale well for one I for what I've seen so this is why I like I really like to use far because you could have a multiple inspectors and you could see at the same time what's happening and this is with the sequentiality of of of notebooks you you like end up scrolling because this workflow is really long like uh like a really long and you could like finish in one week like it could take month and actually and it was a problem to to share this this notebook because for one person it was okay but when they wanted to share to to other that they like no you need to execute this part and then this part and this part so it was like the workflow was the ordering things was like a a need for communication verbal communication and it didn't scal for for I did for for what I did so the idea of of the library U it was like uh kind of provide a different way to to develop this these kind of things okay thank [Applause] you"

Over the years you may have heard David talk about his use of TheBrain. Jerry is one of the earliest adopters, and has tracked an astounding number of ideas and their interconnections. By using TheBrain, Jerry says it shifts him from system 1 thinking (fast) to system 2 thinking (slow). He describes the need for a fundamental shift from thinking of ourselves as consumers to thinking of ourselves as citizens. He also talks about the importance of designing systems that start from trust, which get better results that cost less and have terrific side effects, like rebuilding community and releasing our inherent genius."

Over the years you may have heard David talk about his use of TheBrain. Jerry is one of the earliest adopters, and has tracked an astounding number of ideas and their interconnections. By using TheBrain, Jerry says it shifts him from system 1 thinking (fast) to system 2 thinking (slow). He describes the need for a fundamental shift from thinking of ourselves as consumers to thinking of ourselves as citizens. He also talks about the importance of designing systems that start from trust, which get better results that cost less and have terrific side effects, like rebuilding community and releasing our inherent genius."

We've seen\nsome unprecedented trends around the world,\nlike European democracies changing prime\nministers four times over six years, and other countries\ngetting stuck in an endless cycle\nof national elections. In some major\ndemocracies, people have even stormed\nparliament buildings, claiming the elections\ndid not reflect the true\nwishes of the people. You might be wondering, is democracy actually working for anyone? Is it time to drop democracy altogether? Well, let's start\nwith debunking two major misconceptions about liberal democracy. The first misconception is that having elections equals having democracy. It's true\nthat when most of us hear the word democracy,\nwe think of elections and which political party\nwe’ll vote for. But elections\nare not enough to create a democracy. There's another\ncrucial ingredient that makes democracy democratic. That crucial\ningredient is a shield, a shield of basic rights and freedoms\nthat protects you as a citizen,\nno matter which party is elected\ninto office. And irrespective of whether you're\npart of the majority or the minority of voters. In a liberal democracy, if your liberal rights are compromised\nby the government, then an independent\nlegal system should have the ability\nto protect you and to make sure\nthat the rulers also abide by the rules. The same goes\nfor the press. An independent press,\nlike individuals, should be able\nto raise its voice and expose\na breach of rights or to criticize\nthe rulers’ corruption or illegal actions\nif and when they happen. This is why independent\npress and powerful legal systems are crucial\nfor democracy. These are the tools\nthat democracy uses to guarantee\nyour shield of rights, even if you are part\nof a minority. The second common\nmisconception about democracy\nis that democracy simply means\n‘majority rules’. So let's consider\nthe following scenario. Imagine that 70%\nof a country's citizens votes for party X. After the elections,\nParty X legally decides the remaining 30%\nof citizens A.K.A ‘the minority’, cannot keep any of their\nprivate possessions. All their private property\nis taken from them and given to the 70%\nof citizens who voted\nfor the ruling party. Would you consider this a democratic decision? Well,\ntechnically, it's not. Here's why. In a democracy, the winner doesn't\ntake it all. If the winning party\ntakes it all then it's no longer\na democracy! The most precious aspect\nof liberal democracy apart\nfrom the right to vote, is that it\nlimits the power of the winning party\nby having politicians respect a specific\nshield of rights and the freedoms\nof each citizen. Even if that citizen did not vote for them. Winston Churchill once said “No one pretends that democracy is perfect\nor all-wise. Democracy is the worst\nform of government  - except for all those other forms\nthat have been tried.” What do you think? How about we take a vote on it?"

        "text": "here I there I have uh the opportunity to develop uh bi informatics Library uh using actually farro and so this talk is is to present the the work I did in the in in that time so uh as the the okay bios small is a the library for bi informatics is part of the by informatics Foundation um and uh of course it's a it's a tool only to help there are already hundreds of thousands and by informatic tools used every day by by informaticians and so this is a kind of tool that I developed to to kind of of uh speed up the the work I had to do uh using farro um what I this is a bit of of introduction because it's kind of comp I know it's Friday everyone is a bit tired but we're going to talk about molecular biology but uh no I I will try to to make it easier I'm not a molecular biologist or geneticist but I will try to explain As I understood so the the area has a bit of of context which was the development of of the human Chom project um and I want to to I I really like to this this graphic because it shows the the what happened after the completion of the the partial completion of the human genome um which uh I know that in the UI exist each of the millions of dollars which cost at the point which was kindly draft and and through the x x uh we have the the years that it takes it actually started before but at 2003 it was completed by 19% but uh of course the that people didn't know that it was partially completed so and at some point in 2008 there was a a a drop which was when the sequencing centers started to switched to a new technology which is called nggs for Next Generation sequencing the previous one was was called senture and this and this development of a new technology like really make the the cost of sequencing really cheap um and the amount of data explode actually because uh we we passed from analyzing just one or a group of genes in an organism to analy thousands of them uh and dis enable to to new areas like functional genomics just to the the functions of of genes uh in a more contextual way with more data like I kind of develop so and at some point this this will impact in what's called personalized medicine which is uh kind of when when the technology became accessible to all of us at a really cheap cost and and this this will be like a another huge uh uh development of of the technology but this is like uh one of the one of the driven factors Through The Years um so but from uh by the way the the whole cost of the the project the for the just the human gen on Project project costed 10 billion of dollars so that's is the funding we are talking about so but to to go to the other side what what's I really like this one because it summarize uh well enough without too much complexity how how what's happening inside of us so each uh each cell in our organism contains a nucleus and the nucleus has a its own copy of of the genome and basically the genome is all of our organisms DNA and and we could see that it's organized in chromosome of course and and DNA is a a chain of small molecules which are called nucleotides and nucle is coming of course that we represent with the four letters which are AC DT and they came in pairs um in two strands uh and if you they they came like always like a is pair with G and uh C is pair CTO is paired with with she and if you ever need to remember this you could use alant taring and car G because like easier to memorize it's like a neot technic yes and um also this is basically the the the structure and the kind of of objects that we manage is at the very basic level is is managing this kind of of of molecules and for the now for the more functional part is how how does it really overing simplification of course how does it work so we have a two strands of DNA and and we have a a process which is called transcription and transcription is like essential to life it's the first step of gene expression and and it consists of of translating copying the the DNA into RNA which is another kind of of molecule and and this is like the the beginning of of of the Gen expression and when the cell need to do something like it locates the right position at the at the DNA and it starts to to transcri to transcribe and then the there is another process which is called translation and the translation is takes the the RNA by three and this is like it's called a codone and this translate into amino acids and which together together they build a protein so of course that there is a other type of RNA like noncoding re which has a other type of function like regulatory functions and and there are hundred of of for example non-coding RNA but this is like a kind of basic uh overview um so we have uh in in the library we could like represent this these operations we we could use uh we start from a a sample sequence and we just converted in an object and the object has a read of course it shows the second less length on the DNA alphabets and DNA alphabets as uh it has its own uh it's own hierarchy of of uh properties because every every kind of of alphabet like DNA or RNA has different codes and um from there we could like from the sequence we could transcribe um and um it has another kind of alphabet which is RNA alphabet and we could back transcribe which is this is actually called complimentary DNA but in for our case the thing is that uh we have like a mismatch between what happens in Vivo in vitro and in silico so not all is not all the the operations has which happens in real life in biology has like a sense to to represent in the computer so we are like selecting which which operations that uh we we perform um but of course that biology is way way more complicated and of course we have the the complement the the alant taring and car thing and this like lets you to represent the two strands to the to the complimentary sequence and we have of course the reverse complement because the DNA is read in one strand is read in One Direction and from the other Str is read u in another Direction and finally we can translate to to the protein sequence so as it's read by three you see that the the protain the amino acids are only three for that sequence uh so I we we have also sequence utilities we could calculate the these are some sequence statistics like the CC content and the CC is a value that uh researchers look um because uh DNA is the nucleotides the for nucle is uh without selective pressures or or any kind of of of mutational event there is a they are equally distributed in the genome so when you have an over representation of of CC of one CTO content you could have like a contamination of samples and like that you could uh check if your your sample procedure was correct um this is a a a measure that should be like really low standard and we could of course plot with help of um Ral um and we have another because in the end this is all thermodynamics and and we could like get the molecular weight there are algorithm for that and the local complexity is a is another is another measure which LEDs uh to the determine the the varant nucleotid composition and of course the a letters also to determine if the sequence quality and we have also that because sequences nucle could could be um represented by by there could be like many position because there are sometimes there are the sequencing machines they give errors and you could have for a position you could have different possibilities uh um of course we have some algorithm for for pattern matching which is counting some Sub Sub subsequences on the long on some check some uh measures uh which are pretty standard in the in the bionformatics world and of course that we could like we could plot the the distribution of the fast f is is the basic format in BIO informatics it's a PL text it was developed in the 70s but it's still alive today um the thing is that um of course have sequence alignment but the thing I I want to tell that you will see like faster format is one format if you ever like want to experiment this but there are multiple formats in B forat it's not like a an area which is like um uh satellites or or the super collider where you have just one type of data here you have a millions of organisms and you have the also the instrumentation methods for each one of the each of the organism and each species has its part particularities and and if you combine everything together and you have different teries of study like transcriptomics which St studies the RNA and you have genomics which is focused in the DNA and proteomics and metabolomics and you mix all of that you have a a a very Tous field with multiple databases so it's not like you have a a single format you have a a multitude of formats and there are some kind of of lack of of coordination efforts to to join this together so it's very common it's very complex because biological organisms are really complex so this is one of comment I wanted to to make so sequence alignment is a big field in the in bi informatics and we have seen the if you have seen the r presentation we have seen and this is are these are more the for the biological explanation these are kind of matrices to to represent the the history of the actually they represent an hypothesis of the the evolution of of of multiple organisms on each line it represents an individual and each column is called a seat a site and and it represent the the what happen in in an specific position of the of a chromosome uh and you will see that there are some gaps and there are some regions that are more like similar and those are represents like conserved regions where the function of a gene was like positively selected um by the the evolution of species and there are some gaps where where you have a very VAR variant um like mutation and you can study why there is some mutations there what what happened in the evolutionary history um of course that that you could build finally an alignment but the thing is like mostly they are like you could have a sequence of study and and you could make the the query remotely um and like compare with different like from nucleotides through to protain or nucleo against nucleotides you have different kind of queries and you will do that like this like local search and you could use a other software for for doing alignment this is the sample input for for aligning the the FAS sequence of the coid genome um this is all implemented with with wrappers because everything that is already researched and we have also a local aligner implemented which implements needl man W which is a technique of dynamic programming uh which uh implements a variant of alignment which is um Global alignment which align end to end a sequence there are there are other technique which used by blast which is the the local aler which only looks given a wider sequence only looks the the specific part that you are interested so uh we have an implementation of of of these algorithms basically a matrix uh scoring use a matrix scoring and Trace back to to optimize the the pro the the problem of of sequence matching and and we could like Implement very more complex pipelines uh for example for for retrieving all the the sequences for for the co for example we could just with the identifiers by now there are eight millions of identifiers of sequences of the the Co genome and we can align them um and pass them just in a few few lines of code um and of course that we we could have other we we have other functionality like getting consensus sequences which is the most represented uh nucleo that a position we have a repeats like analyzing most of the DNA is repeated and we don't know yet the the function of of this it was called chunk DNA but through the years we we are realizing that it's not actually shank is that we don't know what he doing and U but uh yes some some type of is called also fossil DNA because it so that it has some function in the past of our history but now we don't know and codon tables which are useful for translating the protain and this is all implemented in the use following the nomenclature of UPAC which is an Institute of applied chemistry and of course i' I shown the the alphabet features and records are like more like a high level representations of of the information of of sequences and we have H also just one liner to download genomes of the species that you want the genomes are also versioned and um rubers we have rubers for population genetics um links and calop is are is a is a tool for for working with the Next Generation sequences which is a lot way more data represents the world Genome of an organism and blast of course and clal for multiple sequence alignment and structure for po population stratification like determining the the structure of of a population without previous knowledge um and have shape it for sham imputation and HH s is for for hidden Market model profiling like youle search with the algorithm you could search the homology the the thing that with with bionformatics is that that you use this transfer of know Knowledge from other species to know what your species what your sequence is doing like how which function does it have so you you you try to use the the to transfer the knowledge from other species to to to the one that you're studing so there are some many ways to do that and one is sequence similarity and the other is using hidden Mark of models which try to look for patterns in in in re of of a sequence and we have other aligners and we have formatters to to format the the all the the multiple kind of data we could have and faster format and shin bank and other formats for population genetics um and we have parser for all these um for XML and giving B the shin bank and the SBA and this is actually like a kind point of entry to the library if you want to experiment once um because the entrance Library basically the whole thing is organized in primary and secondary databases and the primary databases is that where the the place where researchers upload the sequences like a kind of archive and they they perform some kind of basic annotations but they are not really well created is somewhat created and this is organized globally in three data centers we will say that when is from the chin bank it's located in United States and the a which is um here in Europe anded Kingdom um the the is from Japan so these are synchronized every day and they contain millions of millions of trillions of of nucle nucleotides and of course that you have a multiple everything is accessible from from the from the library um with just a a kind um buy on trust client like you will have access to all of these database like some of of some of them are very specific like uh like cancer chromosomes of or cancer bionformatics or or I don't know for for protonics or taxonomies so this is like a huge um area um so this is kind of the high overview level overview and we have some application that through the years and in this case for example one one applic the real application that we have used uh the library is uh to determine this is complex to explain so give me a second so uh the idea is that you could have a um uh some breeds that are composed actually that this happen in animal genetics and you kind of compose a breed to to have a um positive uh selection of some features for example resistance to to heat in in tropical areas and so we want to know here the the goal of This research if was the the uh particular region of of the chromosome 23 which is called the the the I sorry I forgot the name the major isoc compatibility index uh which encodes for for sheins um uh which uh is they are suspected to have a response for adaptive immune adaptive immune response and this is linked to to resistance to Tropical environments also we determine it with the goal what to determine which uh if if which was uh the which one of the was the ancestry which has most impact in the in the development of this brangus CLE which is a combination of Brahman and Angus and so we we came to the conclusion that brayman was the the the fer that has most impact in the for for this particular characteristic and and this was like a bit more fun which uh there was a a call from a prosecutor and he has an hypothesis that uh the arrested the suspected which was arrested uh from a crimes um the victim has a dog and the the shoes of the of the suspected has some kind of FAL material and the pr pru hypothesis was to to see if if they match so we kind of did a um Phil Geographic analysis with using these databases to to help in forensic in this particular fory case um so we developed a kind of workflow for for this kind of thing which is now uh which is now kind of of in the public was was in the public I because this one like original to to check because from from FAL material the DNA is very degradated and it's difficult to to see to extract some some information from there and we have a runs of of of osity which is um kind of measureing the brething levels and this gives a measure of um of uh health risk in population um so in in this analysis it's a bit more complicated but the the analysis it's was that using this this metric which is called runs of osity which are in alls that from from one generation to another uh that um gives some some some kind of indication of of the of the the possibility of of having a a population which is more has more health risk of of in because of in breathing which is maing of closely related individuals um so this of course there is the paper of of the library bios motto itself and we we publish it and we have some some benchmarks to to measure the against other other libraries and we have outperform uh in the for example in the puring of of big XML files we oper from other libraries um recently I immigrated everything because this was done with ptit parser one and now I'm using Petit parser 2 which pretty fast actually um okay so everything is available here in in in the the repository and thank you now you have some questions if I understand correctly have those Triplets of the encoding asss uh the number of possible amocs is less than all the possible combinations so that means that if you have a sequence you should probably be able to determine if you have it in the correct order or you need toe confidence uh you are asking about if the the translation from RNA to protain you have a sequence of DNA which inodes amino acids yes and we have only 12 acids which means that um some of them do not make sense so if you uh have a sequence and then you see that there is more combinations that make sense then those that do not make sense and if you reverse it it's in opposite and you may be quite sure that you have the sequence in the right order is it correct um actually with the the thing with the comparative Chic like comparing sequences um uh which is kind of the the part of the alignment of alignment of sequences is uh like to determine that the what's called hology and when like you see what's uh what for each position is it's like is it's not that it doesn't make sense but you like you need to uh to like Rec accommodate the the ordering so to see because of the the the sampling method and the the procedure of of getting the from the material the the DNA material to to the machines is like a very prone error and could have like multiple errors of of lectures of reading um um from this is not is not that doesn't make sense but the most part that you need to to like realign this like to to see which sites has more hology like is like common ancestry information with with one with another so uh so it's kind of uh that you need to to start with a hypothesis of what you are looking for so this is why you align specific regions against more complete annotated or reference genomes um this is the point where most people start uh so this is very for humans is really well annotated so if you are going to Su the some human disease or everything has each position is is really well annotated and there are lot of of data supporting especially where where there is positions of where there are mutations um for Animals it's more complicated because there are not so much funding for for them there are actually a lot but not so much as as human so and especially when the the mutations related with with cancer uh for the cancer informatics is is the getting the most funding actually but um yes it's kind of that is kind of the point of of start okay in in informatics there is a lot of uses of computational notebooks at this with python for example python I know I I don't know if you have experience with with teaching or creating let's say educational material and who do you see the use of computational notebooks uh in this case for example for for bios or what's like kind of the picture of using computational notebooks in bi informatics using smart work yeah um the the area that that you're asking about I think that you're your asking is about um exploratory B informatics which is kind of different of confirmatory but uh when you're doing the explorator what I've seen of using not uh notebooks like Jupiter and everything is that people usually start like like man but when the workflow diverge like you need to really have need to do multiple parallel experiments but because you are like exploring and you need to have a different workflow path and it doesn't scale well for one I for what I've seen so this is why I like I really like to use far because you could have a multiple inspectors and you could see at the same time what's happening and this is with the sequentiality of of of notebooks you you like end up scrolling because this workflow is really long like uh like a really long and you could like finish in one week like it could take month and actually and it was a problem to to share this this notebook because for one person it was okay but when they wanted to share to to other that they like no you need to execute this part and then this part and this part so it was like the workflow was the ordering things was like a a need for communication verbal communication and it didn't scal for for I did for for what I did so the idea of of the library U it was like uh kind of provide a different way to to develop this these kind of things okay thank [Applause] you"
