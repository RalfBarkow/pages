Progress!\n\nThis ensures that no one can hack us anymore because no one understands the code anymore: Important information needed to understand the code base is hidden in a directory service, and we don't even know which one.

We've been working towards this for decades! \"NOTABUG, WONTFIX\"\n\nAnd that's the real problem here. Many are now calling for \"More control!\", \"More review!\", \"More funding!\", \"More eyes on the code!\". What would really help would be less code, less indirection and boilerplate, and just more... simplicity.\n\nWhy do I need a LogAppenderFactorySingleton that reads XML to get the name of the class it needs to instantiate so I can drop my log line in there to asynchronously append to a LogStream? That's not simple. What is simple? Print JSON to stderr. That's simple.

Dependency analysis only makes sense if the list of these dependencies is finite and just as immutable as the infrastructure.\n\nJava once had the necessary control buttons that allowed us to enforce that this list of dependencies was finite and immutable. If you're into that kind of lifestyle, there's something called SM: Oracle SM.\n\nSM brings the necessary contracts and discipline that a codebase needs.

Think of it like a three year old popping each class in his mouth to find out how it tastes and if it can be executed.\n\nIn the end, that's exactly the specification: here's an object, deserialize it. In Java, that means that the code for the object's class has to come from somewhere, and its methods are then executed. Of course, no one would think that was a good idea if it was phrased that way. But then again, the person who implemented it eight years ago didn't see it, and neither did the hundreds of thousands who imported log4j into their codebase.\n\nWhat does this tell us about the dependency management process of organizations that develop software? About understanding the codebase, the dependencies, and the processes that plan data flow and releases? Right. \"We use modular architecture and agile methods to increase development velocity.\""

What would really help would be less code, less indirection and boilerplate, and just more... simplicity.\n\nWhy do I need a LogAppenderFactorySingleton that reads XML to get the name of the class it needs to instantiate so I can drop my log line in there to asynchronously append to a LogStream? That's not simple. What is simple? Print JSON to stderr. That's simple.

        "text": "A term coined by [[Alan Kay]] to describe a way of using computers.  In [[Early History Of Smalltalk]], Alan Kay explains how after seeing Seymour Papert's work with [[Logo Language]] he grew to see personal computing less as a \"personal dynamic vehicle\" and more as a \"personal dynamic medium\".  Instead of the computer being primarily used for its capacity to perform computation, what if it were used as a medium for communication?  Not just as a way for people to send each other text, or pictures, or sound, but as a way to send each other active, \"live\" simulations of their ideas?"
