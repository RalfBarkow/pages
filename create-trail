We present an end to end system “Sunrise” to assist users in using location based data to tag, cluster, and find digital photos. We suggest that location tagging of photos is a common desire of users but existing manual solutions are too time consuming and complex. Our 3-tier system offers a solution that integrates automated location tagging with existing manual approaches. The mobile component of our system captures GPS based data at user defined intervals to create trail logs of the user’s movements. The desktop component automates location tagging of the photos and makes use of the GPS location data to provide assisted photo keywording through a process of reverse geo-coding. The server component uses automated location clustering techniques to produce hierarchical location representations, to simplify photo navigation and generate temporal/spatial data combinations enabling assisted photo management."
