        "text": "So, I want to show two websites. This here is the first website. If you can see this, this is the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics. Now the American Academy of Pediatrics is\nan organization founded in the 1930s, a budget of something like $80 million, 60,000\nmembers, considered by pediatricians, scientists, and government as one of the premier authorities\non the health and well-being of children, okay. On the other hand, this is the American College\nof Pediatricians. Now, the American College of Pediatricians\nwas founded to protest the adoption of children by same sex couples, okay. It’s not a professional organization, it’s\nconsidered by many to be a single-issue hate group. So, these two sites are from completely different\nuniverses and it should be pretty easy to tell them apart, right? Some Stanford researchers recently looked\nat just that issue. They took three sets of people. Stanford students, professional historians,\nand professional fact checkers, sat them down in front of a computer and gave them 5 minutes\nto figure out which would be the more credible source. So, how did they do? Well the answer is not very well. First, let’s talk about the historians. Half of the historians couldn’t say for\nsure which site was the more credible site. The Stanford students, how did they do? Sixty-five percent actually chose the website considered by many to be a hate site as the more credible source. Finally, we had the professional fact checkers. The professional fact checkers, one hundred\npercent of them got it right and not only did they get it right, but they got it right\nquickly. A lot of people in the other groups used their\nfull five minutes. These fact checkers got it right in seconds. So, what accounts for that difference? The fact checkers, they used a set of skills that are web native. A set of skills that help them very quickly\nget to the truth of the matter. I want to show you how to use those skills\nand that’s what we’re gonna start to do in the next video."
