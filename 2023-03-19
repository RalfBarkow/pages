The [[Container Algebra]] page has a more complete discussion of the algebraic structure of container numbers. Finally, Network numbers work just like container numbers, but network numbers use signal propagation rather than containment as an active model of computation. Block numbers also work like container numbers, but using yet another type of spatial representation, three-dimensional stacks of blocks."

Each of these models contributes significantly to channel propagation modeling. +e mentioned groups of the propagation model had contributed to the successful estimation of signal propagation loss for effective design of wireless communication systems. Among the numerous path loss models that exit, the empirical path loss propagation models have been widely used to predict the behavior of radio signals as they propagate throughout a particular environment and location. +ese models have enjoyed much attention from researchers because of their ease of use and simplicity, and the implementation of these empirical models requires less computational efforts. However, they failed to fully take into consideration the physical composition of the target environment, making them vulnerable to high prediction errors when applied in an environment different from which it was built for [4]."
