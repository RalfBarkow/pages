They are processes which are based on a tissue of \"unconscious\" collective psychic processes and which are not only fed by this tissue but are also largely controlled by it. This fabric reaches far beyond the human being, easily encompasses all living things and frays downward. The \"I\" proves to be a kind of tip of an iceberg dissolving in the collective and crystallizing from there. It turns out to be an ideological reification of psychological processes. Moreover, it becomes clear that even on the \"conscious\" level there is no question of a definable identity. Rather, it is an inter-subjective networking through which information is produced in constant exchange. From this point of view, the \"I\" is to be seen as a reservoir into which information flows, where it is processed and provisionally stored in order to be passed on. In this respect, the \"I\" appears as a constantly shifting node of an intersubjective tissue, which sits on top of a collective \"unconscious\" psychic tissue."
