But when a particular set of ‘terms’ (patterns) are assembled in Alexander pattern language - to address a particular working challenge, the design of a particular nexus of practices - what is immediately to-hand, ‘on top’ of the selected body of descriptions and references, is a set of contextualised-descriptions - the patterns' **names** and lead paragraphs - which can be ‘sung’ - in a ‘poetic’ or ‘choral’ dialectic rather than a mechanical, Lego-fashion act of assembly - into a composite context reading, and a composite ‘recommendation’ or ‘invitation’ for a performance of a newly (re)constituted practice.\n"

The everyday life of a species such as ours runs (necessarily - we’re wired that way) on a narrative surface of reified, familiarised categories, formations and inhabited forms; while - in contrast - design mobilises analytic, genetic models of dominant and subordinate processes, multiple determinations (the polyvalency of ‘boundary objects’); of dynamics in contradiction, of overdetermined ‘resolutions’, of struggles and metamorphoses, balances of varying - even incommensurable - forces. \n"

Around that time he worked at The Design Centre, and co-authored two ‘design toolkit’ collections of ‘methods’: *Social venturing* \\[Murray et al xxx 2009] and *The open book of social innovation* \\[Murray et al xxx 2010]. These are distinctly over towards the left-side of the ‘dance’ schema and have a design-patternish form; but rather in the nature of the discrete, modular ‘unit operations’ of chemical engineering design - somewhat Lego-like - rather than the ‘sung-together’ form of Alexander pattern language? \n"

As far as I know Robin didn’t extend this collection of story-form descriptions of  ‘principles’ to create a library, and these ten bear a rather arbitrary relationship to the long lists of ‘methods and tools’ (in *The open book of social innovation*, 527 of them) that were developed around the same time.\n\n"

This involved what might seem to be the most arcane distinctions between modes: extensive and intensive differential rent. Robin works wonderfully hard at handling “the apparent disjunction between Marx's theoretical categories and the demands of concrete analysis” \\[Murray 1977, 101]. He moves from relations of production of rent and value, in Part One of his article, to discussion in Part Two of actual strategies of actual rentiers, and actual contradictions - including contradictions in the ‘structure of feeling’ (the *ontology* of value, land, productivity) - of the strategies of formations of capitalist and rentier actors, attempting to achieve coherent practices and institutions (and profit streams) in particular material terrains. These terrains embrace ‘land’ in the broadest sense, in various politically significant domains including oil and energy, extractive industries - which would today include the enclosure of forests and wild water as well as mining - and real estate.\n\n"

This involved what might seem to be the most arcane distinctions between modes: extensive and intensive differential rent. Robin works wonderfully hard at handling “the apparent disjunction between Marx's theoretical categories and the demands of concrete analysis” \\[Murray 1977, 101]. He moves from relations of production of rent and value, in Part One of his article, to discussion in Part Two of actual strategies of actual rentiers, and actual contradictions - including contradictions in the ‘structure of feeling’ (the *ontology* of value, land, productivity) - of the strategies of formations of capitalist and rentier actors, attempting to achieve coherent practices and institutions (and profit streams) in particular material terrains. These terrains embrace ‘land’ in the broadest sense, in various politically significant domains including oil and energy, extractive industries - which would today include the enclosure of forests and wild water as well as mining - and real estate.\n\n"

Around that time he worked at The Design Centre, and co-authored two ‘design toolkit’ collections of ‘methods’: *Social venturing* \\[Murray et al xxx 2009] and *The open book of social innovation* \\[Murray et al xxx 2010]. These are distinctly over towards the left-side of the ‘dance’ schema and have a design-patternish form; but rather in the nature of the discrete, modular ‘unit operations’ of chemical engineering design - somewhat Lego-like - rather than the ‘sung-together’ form of Alexander pattern language? \n"

She has a lovely stream of scholarship that constructs a history of solidarity economy in black American culture, demonstrating that, yes, coops are part of black movements, black people have succeeded strikingly with coops and kindred forms of economic organising. It’s a lost history (she adduces secrecy under the threat of violence, in the Jim Crow era, and concealment under McCarthyite persecution) which she narrates in black community settings, eliciting surprised responses: Oh, so that’s what my uncles and aunts were doing, what the grandparents and great-grandparents were about. I thought coops were something just white people did!\n\nNembhard, a wonderfully particularistic roots researcher (I’m reminded of EP  Thompson, who I’ve known for longer, and who writes of my own working-class making) is emphatic around diversity and the depth of change, which she speaks of in terms of Intersections of repressive and destructive life-situation . . black, brown, poor, migrant, enslaved, women, LGBTQ+. Humanness, she says,\n> . . is about *all the intersections*. We have to figure out how our economics can provide dignity for *all* those intersections. We *can* have economic democracy and economic justice for everybody - but we have to be very *deliberate* about it . . . It’s not just about diversity and inclusion, that doesn’t take us far enough . . . We have to really examine ourselves, so that we don’t bring that baggage . . \\[We need to be aware of] all the isms and whatever.” ::\\[Nembhard xxx, my italics]::\nHere’s a call for deep aesthetic perception and intention in everyday actions and affiliations. When you dismantle the dominant order, you have to be aware of “all the isms and whatever” or you just reproduce the old aesthetic order, and end up being disrespectful (without mutuality, without regard, blind, disdainful, supremacist) toward the life of some groups.\n\nNembhard pitches the ‘deliberateness’, in her storytelling (and in conversational exchanges around the stories), in terms of ‘groups’, and in terms of persistent everyday labour and vigilance, removing “all the isms and whatever” and *keeping* them removed (replaced). There’s a widely used rhetorical frame here, of social justice. It doesn’t amount, though, to a conceptualisation of classes and formations, and of *relations of production* dominant, residual and emergent. It’s that additional explicitness and particularity, and the consequent capacity for theorisation of *dual power* established and maintained through epochal historical transitions, that can be furnished by a pattern language (with stories in its containers) as distinct from just (!) a committed practice of storytelling, and a giving back of the/a history of ‘a people’: an affiliative, resonating we.\n\nLikewise with case study, a favoured mode of Robin’s (which includes for example his ‘ten principles’ in DaO). Phenomena such as uneven development, multiple determinations and contradictions (consequently, struggles between formations), conjunctures, modes of production, classes and cultural and aesthetic formations, need conceptualising - through families of patterns around altered *relations* of production (powers) and prefigurative weaves of *forces* of production (the everyday practices of formations) - and not just instantiating in richly contextualised or poetically voiced stories. This constitutes the particularity of insight for organising properly radical formations. Mobilising a pattern language furnishes capacity to weave fabric, within which are multiple, distinct, locations, holding distinct resources, on distinct lifelines: many journeyings - even among people in ‘the same’ place and ‘the same’ situation. Pattern language can be used to do the same work as narrative:  news from elsewhere, encouragement, vision, reanimation of ‘our’ tradition of making and of a historical ‘we’; solidarity, alignment, imaginative and grounded construction of pluriverse, ‘intersectionality’. But pattern language, as rigorous conceptualisation, can be organised and populated to give historical *traction* - historical context - to both narrative and poetry.\n\nOn the right-side of the dance-of-knowing schema, it’s important to not stay focused on the explicit modes ‘above the line’. The tacit modes below the line are pivotal: the college is more about genre and the (re)production and cyborg hybridising of genres, than storytelling. Robin’s practice of ‘networking’ in fairtrade does the work of skilful storytelling - like his and Nembhard’s (and EP Thompson’s, and Raymond Williams’s; etcetera) - but does it by furnishing direct participatory experience ‘now’ rather than storytelling ‘elsewhere’. Making it *lived* and *directly* mutual in this way changes the character of ‘story’. It enables direct perception of and affiliation with *conditions* . . of life, of ‘elsewhere’; of unevenness in development and perception and commitment, mutuality of need and desire, compassion and hardship, danger and opportunity . . of the plural, manifold, situationally differing weaves of mutual-sector motivation and commitment: the ‘six Rs’ of rescue and respite, resistance and solidarity, reporting and recording, re-weaving of life-fabric, reparation and reconciliation for generations of harm, revolution and regime change.\n\nSuch direct furnishing of mutuality in lived practice is the basis of the college school of Festival and visiting. Other modes within the dance of knowing (landscape §2, labour power), other landscapes of material engagement (§1 means of subsistence, §3 affiliations and the production of the heart-mind), and other (altered) relations of production are foundations for other families of pattern, and thus other college faculties and schools."

Phenomena such as uneven development, multiple determinations and contradictions (consequently, struggles between formations), conjunctures, modes of production, classes and cultural and aesthetic formations, need not only not just *instantiating* and putting in the on-stage spotlight, in richly contextualised, fine-grained or poetically voiced stories, but also conceptualising - through families of patterns around altered *relations* of production (powers) and prefigurative weaves of *forces* of production (the everyday practices of formations). This constitutes the particularity of insight for organising properly radical formations. \n"
