The code only has two values and must assign one of them to every communication: the code true/untrue cannot maintain its binarity and claim that the utterance “I’m lying” is meaningless (“meaningless” would be a third value).\nWhen operative closure [→Autopoiesis] is added to binarity, it can lead to the differentiation of an autopoietic system. In the case of the scientific sys- tem, for instance, this is expressed in the condition of limitationality [→Sci- ence]. Limitationality means that the field of possible options is reduced in such a way that a code-related definition restricts the area of what is possi- ble: the discovery of a falsehood is not only a negative fact that would yield no information in a further search for truths; it is, at the same time, positive information about the range of truths that are still possible. Under these conditions, every code-oriented operation contributes to define the boundaries of the system with the outside, and to specify its internal connections. Thus, a network of interconnected communications is created that develops a form of independence from the remaining parts of society. Scientific communication differentiates itself in society, for instance, through its orientation towards the code true/untrue. It constitutes an autopoietic system, whose operations refer to earlier operations oriented to the code true/untrue (because these de- fine the conditions and possibilities of further truths) and to later communi- cations (because these, in the same way, specify the area of future operations).\nCodes, therefore, are distinctions through which a system observes its own operations; they determine the unity of the system. They allow the sys- tem to recognize which operations contribute to its reproduction and which do not. For instance, all and only those communications oriented to the code true/untrue belong to the system of science; only those oriented to the code legal/illegal belong to the legal system. Every system processes all its com- munications exclusively through the values of its code: the legal judgment or the aesthetic beauty of a communication is irrelevant for its scientific truth and vice versa. Every operation oriented to a code draws a boundary between inside and outside (thereby the distinction between self-reference and other- reference). This yields the differentiation of coding problems and reference problems [→Constructivism].\nA functional system processes every possible object through its code, in- cluding the communications that belong to other functional systems. A legal communication oriented to the code legal/illegal is, for instance, processed by science according to the distinction true/untrue. Using an expression pro- posed by Gotthard Günther, Luhmann claims that the code of every functional system operates as a rejection value towards the binarity that orients another system. Thus through the rejection value, it is possible to refuse the binary schematization of that communication and to deal with it from another per- spective. Society as a whole is thus defined as polycontextural, this mean that it includes many “contextures,” each oriented to a different distinction.\nBinarity is essential for the functioning of the code, which must process its values symmetrically: an institutionalized preference for positive values (e.g., the beautiful or the legal or the true) would make the reversibility between positive and negative values more difficult and partially destroy the benefits of binarity. The code itself produces no criteria for action and sets no prefer- ences. However, within operations oriented to the code, choosing one value over the other has different consequences. True, legal, ownership (the positive values) represent the connection capability of the operations and their com- pactness (different truths confirm each other), while the negative side of the codes stand for reflective values (an untruth leads to the revision of earlier truths). The form of asymmetry thereby introduced in the strict symmetry of the code leads to the issue of →programs, which translate codes into directions for action.
