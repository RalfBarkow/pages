In created in school from the ground up, the many choices before you are exciting, overwhelming and endless… uniforms, programs, class names, books, colours, mascots, mottos, emblems, the list goes on. Yet, at our first get together and for many more after that, these choices were rarely spoken of or given much airtime. Instead, we dreamt. We even gave up a long weekend and holidayed together at our ‘retreat’ building our connections, reimagining and getting intentional about what would be beneath the surface of our shiny new buildings. During this time, our visioning was guided by a common thread of understanding, Educating Ruby, by Guy Claxton. Vicki had gifted a copy to each of her “11 disciples” upon our first meeting and from then on, it has guided our every move and plan, always in the forefront of our mind asking, ‘What is it our children really need to learn?’ "

At its core, it’s rotten and bad and no good for eating. A challenging idea for anyone in education trying their hardest to love and teach our young people with the very best of intentions each day. But Educating Ruby is not all doom and gloom, if fact it’s the opposite. Yes it talks about huge concerns and lays bare some failings but its focus is actually on how to get it right, the moments of brilliance in schooling life where real lessons are learned, character is developed and Rubys emerge with a different collection of worthwhile residuals of education. For the foundation staff at Griffin, Educating Ruby ignited a deeper purpose in our work - to curate real educational change that impacted the future lives of the little people we were to serve in our new community. A different vision for what our learners would be able to do, know and be. "

        "text": "Throughout Educating Ruby a harsh truth is unearthed but yet it’s one that isn’t a surprise – most of what we learn at school will not assist us in living and thriving in our rapidly-changing world or our future lives. Most of what we learn will not stay with us or more importantly, have a positive influence on how we continue to learn into our adult lives. Claxton helps us to question what our deepest wishes are for our children and then sets off pondering how schooling might actually teach lessons worth learning. So, what is actually worth learning these days? Educating Ruby points to transferrable lifelong skills, learning attitudes and beliefs, the ability to think and a creative curiosity when approaching problem-solving. A focus on the nurturing of character all whilst still achieving good achievement scores. Competence AND Character. "

What we loved, what we grew and what we lost as learners. Who had the greatest impact on us and why. What we valued in our past workplaces and what we’d like to swiftly leave behind. Undertaking this exercise post Ruby unearthed some great stories of our own about character development. Many of which saw our newly-connected team willing to get comfortable sharing their vulnerabilities honestly and with raw emotion. Confidence, Communication, Collaboration, Curiosity, Creativity, Commitment and Craftsmanship. The seven character competencies. We now had a deeper understanding and drive towards aiming for a bold shift in educating. Connecting to our own residuals of educational stirred an even greater sense of the mission ahead. It got us asking ourselves hard questions as we continued to envision and make commitments to the culture of our new learning environment. "

Through our simple study of a deeply challenging book, our mindset had shifted and the Griffin teacher mindset began to emerge. Character AND Competence.

Yet, at our first get together and for many more after that, these choices were rarely spoken of or given much airtime. Instead, we dreamt. We even gave up a long weekend and holidayed together at our ‘retreat’ building our connections, reimagining and getting intentional about what would be beneath the surface of our shiny new buildings. During this time, our visioning was guided by a common thread of understanding, Educating Ruby, by Guy Claxton. Vicki had gifted a copy to each of her “11 disciples” upon our first meeting and from then on, it has guided our every move and plan, always in the forefront of our mind asking, ‘What is it our children really need to learn?’ "
