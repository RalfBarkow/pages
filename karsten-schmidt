The project involved creating a graph and visualization tool to represent relationships within the OpenSource computational design/art community, utilizing [[CouchDB]] for storage and RDF vocabularies for describing relationships. Schmidt expresses disappointment in the project's lack of progress due to difficulties in attracting contributors and funding, despite the intention for it to serve as a collaborative knowledge base. Additionally, Schmidt mentions [[DMX]] as a potentially related project but notes a lack of time to delve into it further. This message reflects Schmidt's ongoing interest in collaborative projects within the computational design/art community and the challenges associated with advancing such endeavors. (ChatGPT 3.5)"
