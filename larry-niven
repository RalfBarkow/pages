This bugged me because I found one story line more interesting than the other, and when I got in the \"boring\" story line, I slammed through it so fast to get back to the \"good\" stuff that I missed important information. Second, [[The Ringworld Throne]] has a sort of mini-climax in the middle of the work. [[The Mote In Gods Eye]], written with [[Jerry Pournelle]], has another notable instance of this problem. I prefer stuff that builds up to a unified [[Final Conflict]]. Third, sometimes his style places too much emphasis on narrative and dialogue, and not enough on description; you have to remember how he describes things when he does, because he seldom describes them again. If he described things more, his work would probably be 50% longer. ",

The emphasis isn't so much on character development (and, as mentioned above, when Niven downplays science and tries to make interesting characters, it seems to fall flat).  As you can get a glimpse of when reading All The Myriad Ways (i.e. his notes from his MIT lecture on teleportation), he likes to come up with a zany idea and run with it, make sure it's intellectually consistent.  Rinse, lather, repeat [[[Lather Rinse Repeat]]], and a whole unique universe evolves out of it, social implications included.  It makes his speculative fiction very compelling, in my mind.  For instance, if minor errors in physics annoy you (such as I found in Stephen R. Donaldson's 'Gap' novels), you can rest assured everything's well thought-out in Niven's work. -- [[Joseph Riesen]]",

Second, [[The Ringworld Throne]] has a sort of mini-climax in the middle of the work. [[The Mote In Gods Eye]], written with [[Jerry Pournelle]], has another notable instance of this problem. I prefer stuff that builds up to a unified [[Final Conflict]]. Third, sometimes his style places too much emphasis on narrative and dialogue, and not enough on description; you have to remember how he describes things when he does, because he seldom describes them again. If he described things more, his work would probably be 50% longer. ",

As you can get a glimpse of when reading All The Myriad Ways (i.e. his notes from his MIT lecture on teleportation), he likes to come up with a zany idea and run with it, make sure it's intellectually consistent.  Rinse, lather, repeat [[[Lather Rinse Repeat]]], and a whole unique universe evolves out of it, social implications included.  It makes his speculative fiction very compelling, in my mind.  For instance, if minor errors in physics annoy you (such as I found in Stephen R. Donaldson's 'Gap' novels), you can rest assured everything's well thought-out in Niven's work. -- [[Joseph Riesen]]",
