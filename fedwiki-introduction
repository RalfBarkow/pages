      "text": "# READING: \nWe think of the FedWiki as a new kind of social media platform. Reading a FedWiki site is easier than creating content. Even reading has some new features that are surprising and require some learning on our part. For example:\n* Pages open in a panel, like a newspaper. \n\n* Each new page opens to the right of the last page. This allows us to keep the context of the previous page while exploring the next.\n\n* We can move and rearrange the pages as we like. Move the mouse pointer over the white area above the title. A small hand will appear. Click, hold down the mouse button, and move the page right or left. Release it and it stays where we put it. If, while holding the hand on the top of the page, we \"flick\" the page upwards, it will be removed from the line-up (but not from the site, so don't worry.)\n\n"

This allows you to keep the context of the prior page while exploring the next page.\n* You are encouraged to move the panels around--reorder them to your liking. \n> Just move your mouse - cursor to the white space above the title of a pane.
