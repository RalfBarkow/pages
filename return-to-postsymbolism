Hilbert sought to design a mathematics that supported entirely its own validity, without reference to the context that contains it. Prior to our modern understanding of cybernetics, ecology and embodiment, Hilbert’s dream of metamathematics was a great improvement that literally laid the groundwork for the computational age. But by design metamathematics cannot be *relevant*. Symbols are necessarily obscured, obliterated, by their meaning. Formal symbol systems are designed to deceive. There is no there there.\n"

Venn diagrams, Feynman diagrams, diagrammatic reasoning, cellular automata, fractals, knot theory, string theory, category theory, silicon circuit design; each of these fields relies upon the iconic representation of formal systems. Like geometry these fields can be seen as addressing inherently multidimensional concepts. Formalism is escaping its symbolic constraints."

Mathematics is shifting to visual rather than textual forms of expression. Venn diagrams, Feynman diagrams, diagrammatic reasoning, cellular automata, fractals, knot theory, string theory, category theory, silicon circuit design; each of these fields relies upon the iconic representation of formal systems. Like geometry these fields can be seen as addressing inherently multidimensional concepts. Formalism is escaping its symbolic constraints."
