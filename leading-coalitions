We are improvising. In fact, the key is probably improvisation.\n\nSecond, a recommendation: find at least one person that is or will become consumed by the opportunities.\n\nNext, here are ten ideas we seem to be using in Whatcom County Washington as we pursue perfection in health care delivery across a community.\n"

We are improvising. In fact, the key is probably improvisation.\nSecond, a recommendation: find at least one person that is or will be- come consumed by the opportunities.\nNext, here are ten ideas we seem to be using in Whatcom County Washington as we pursue perfection in health care delivery across a community.\n"

Encourage a radically transformative stance. Model it. Be irre- verent.\nWe have wonderful revolutionaries. We have people with years of suc- cessful experience with coalition building.\n# 3. Become a story junky.\nFind the right stories, tell them, get others tell them. Make them up if necessary.\nStories around campfires have created and sustained tribes and commu- nities for thousands of years. Long before Excel and PowerPoint. We are built to create meaning from stories. Stories go to the heart and heart is what is needed for transformation.\nBecome the story you need.\n\nMake sense, create new meaning with stories. From the chaos of \"facts\" pull out the relevance you need and storify it.\nThis is the job of a leader.\n# 4. Revert to common values. Technique will not work here (yet?).\nExplore values all the time.\nTalk about values.\nTell stories about values.\nHire strong value-based leaders and staff for this work. Values trump power (status quo). You must ensure this.\n# 5. Make it up as you go.\nKarl Weick talks about bricolage, a French word that does not translate well. A bricoleur is a person that can routinely make what they need from what is at hand. They can make a uniquely useful machine from spare parts in a barn and it may do the job better than anything on the market. Gather all the bricoleurs you can find for this kind of work.\nBricolage--A form of improvisation practiced by some, using whatever resources and repertoire come to hand, in order to perform the immediate task. A person who practices bricolage is called a bricoleur.\nIn a paper called Organizational Redesign as Improvisation, Karl Weick identifies the following requirements for successful bricolage.\n- intimateknowledgeofresources - careful observation and listening\n\n- trusting one's ideas\n- self-correcting structures, with feedback\nImprovisation is a related idea. Quite different than \"experimentation\".\nThink of the \"improvisational organization\" as a variant on the \"learn- ing organization.\" More real time, more masterful. That is what is needed.\nFor an in depth understanding of this concept and also a related explo- ration of \"wisdom as improvisation \" see these articles by Karl Weick .\nThe Attitude of Wisdom: Ambivalence as the Optimal Compromise, Karl E. Weick.\n\n  \nI have coined this term to combine two profound yet simple ideas. \"Ap- preciative\" points to a stance and techniques that are well explained by David Cooperrider of Case Western Reserve and Gervase Bushe of Simon Frasier University as well as others. The idea simply stated is—look for what you appreciate and want to see more of instead of focusing first on what you don't like and want to see less of. \"Engagement\" points to Axelrod's the-\n# 6. Appreciative Engagement.\n\nsis that many of the problems of change can be avoided by investing in the engagement of all the folks who will have to implement or change—up front, at the beginning of the exploration. Pay, listen, and engage now to avoid failure in the implementation phase.\n# 7. Systems thinking must trump liner, simplistic plan- ning.\nComplex adaptive systems (CAS) are a useful way to think about health care, especially across organizations—coalitions. Paul Plsek's Appendix B in the Chasm Report is the most important part of the book. The challenge of the book is to create a coherent system that will dramatically reduce the burden of illness in the citizens of this nation. Success is impossible without understanding the way complex, adaptive systems work.\nRules for optimizing a CAS:\n1. Agreement upon clear aims (patient-centered, safe, equi- table, etc.)\n2. Follow a few simple rules (cooperation, relationship, trans- parency, etc.)\n3. Ensure effective communication among the agents/parts\n4. Provide opportunities and resources for experiments (fertiliz-\ning and watering)\n5. Pruning (removing resources from experiments that fail to\nmove the system closer to the aims)\n6. Explicitly model the system for policy making.\n\n> Robert Wood Johnson Foundation paid for the modeling of Congestive Heart Failure and Diabetes care in Whatcom County. The understanding of the local health care system's dynamics is already helping our key stakeholders to come together with aligned incentives. I have never seen anything like this before.\n"

We are improvising. In fact, the key is probably improvisation.\n\nSecond, a recommendation: find at least one person that is or will become consumed by the opportunities.\n\nNext, here are ten ideas we seem to be using in Whatcom County Washington as we pursue perfection in health care delivery across a community.\n"
