The difference is in how they transmit the screen changes across the wire. Raster-based protocols move the screen changes similar to streaming video - when an area of the screen changes, they transmit a small bitmap image of that area, and the client reassembles them into a whole. Vector-based protocols tap into the server's screen at a lower level, and transmit instructions like rectangles and lines. As you can guess, the vector encoding is much smaller, leading to more responsive interaction. Since the vector-based implementations tap into the server's graphics stack at a lower level, they tend to be more accurate. The raster-based implementations tend to use hacks to poll the screen for changes at some interval. Depending on the platform and the point at which they hook in, there are accuracy issues. For example, [[Pc Anywhere]] is incapable of displaying Tk applications, and has problems with Java. VNC doesn't work well with console windows, where keyboard commands lead to text scrolling. All of the raster-based implementations tend to leave \"cursor droppings\" on the screen sometimes. X11 and RDP do not have those problems. X11 is almost as ubiquitous as it gets, though VNC does have it beat. RDP is one of the fastest remote desktop implementations out there. Most people need to access some Unix boxes and some Windows boxes. For Unix, use X11. For Windows, use RDP. When talking from one to the other, there are readily available client implementations for the other platform. If you are talking to some oddball operating system, then VNC is a good last resort.",
