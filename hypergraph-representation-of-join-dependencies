Hypergraphs are generalizations of ordinary graphs, in that a graph is a hypergraph in which every edge consists of exactly two nodes. To relate hypergraphs to join dependencies, let us use one node for each attribute, and let the edges be the objects of the join dependency, that is, the sets of attributes onto which projections are required."
