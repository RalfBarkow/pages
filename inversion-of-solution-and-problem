It is highly questionable as to whether the \"office worker'' skill set is appropriate for those following a programme of education, higher or otherwise. Roszak (1994, p. 51) and Gelernter (1998, p. 61) both point out that the personal computer was introduced into homes, schools and universities without a specific need having been first identified: it was a ``solution in search of problems'' (J. Weizenbaum, quoted in Roszak, 1994, p. 51). The same problem may be true of IT education: that for many people their needs are not being identified and understood. To put it another way, much of IT education may be a case of a lesson in search of a learner. This paper challenges both the idea that IT learning and teaching is simply a question of technique, and that providing people with IT skills of this kind will in any way allow people full and equal participation in the information society."
