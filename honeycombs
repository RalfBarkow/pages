        "text": "[[Honeycombs]] refer to the structure of a beehive, where hexagonal cells are arranged in a repeating pattern. In the context of a hexagonal lattice, \"a more natural neighborhood relationship\" may refer to the fact that each point on the lattice has six nearest neighbors, as opposed to four in a rectangular lattice. This can be useful in certain fields like image processing, where a hexagonal grid can better match the natural shapes found in images and lead to more accurate results. Another example is in cellular automata, where hexagonal grids can lead to different behavior of the system."
