Baecker goes on to characterize agile product development as “a form of reproduction in a medium of its own disintegration, of fulfilling an assignment in the medium of an emptiness that needs to be regained constantly” (Baecker 2017, 19, transl. FG). Thus, agile teams create a boundary between themselves and an organization they belong to. Team members are still also members of the organization, but not all members of the organization are typically team members. This may be different for many small startups, where the product team is the company. In addition, the transparency enforced by agile ways of working means that teams tend to work in interaction situations, i. e., with the observation of mutual presence. Baecker (2005, 110) has proposed two forms to characterize these conditions:"
