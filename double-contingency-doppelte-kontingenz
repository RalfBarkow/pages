Contingency is the fundamental problem for the coordination of selectivity in social and psychic systems, since possibilities for communication and thought are indeed only possibilities: they may be realized differently than expected [→[[Expectations]]]. Thus, contingency means the potential for disappointment and the necessity of risk-taking. In the social dimension, this problem appears as double contingency: every selection is dependent on both ego and alter, and both are meaning-constituting systems.\n"

        "text": "This circularity is interrupted by a new systemic order and becomes asymmetrical [→[[Asymmetrization]]]. The new order originates from the reciprocal observation of ego and alter, and from the information this observation creates. This new order is an operationally closed social system that autopoietically reproduces through the coordination of alter’s and ego’s contingent selections. Double contingency is thus the foundation for the autocatalysis of social systems.\n"
