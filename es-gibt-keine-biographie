So there have been so many ruptures in the tradition that, as a result, such a phrase as loss of meaning or lack of self-realization or emancipation (whatever that can mean then) comes up, as it were.

It's just that it's become circular, sort of.

If you do that, then you are walking blindly into such a situation. One can, after all, recognize certain structural purposes of modern society, and then see that it allows and even encourages fundamentalism, for example, in contrast with the consequences of globalization, which are not welcome to everyone.\n\nH: Oh, so you're concerned with describing the fractures, so to speak, in order to describe the ideologies that arise - necessarily arise - at these fractures, or even through which these fractures can only express themselves, in such a way that one then also confronts these ideologies more adequately than possibly falsely biting into them.\n\nL: So it is to let a little air out of the unnecessary agitation. And then to see what you can do with a better understanding of structural resistance and structural problems.\n\nH: The ethos of your theory is, as it were, that there is none, or can be none, but that ethics and ethos is something that has a very specific place in society, a very specific function, but can never determine the theory of society.\n\nL: I think that's actually a question of.... What do we do with the excluded, who don't agree, and in science they are supposed to write a better theory, but from the point of view of ethos, from the point of view of the normative or moral basic doctrine, one can't really deal with them at all; they are just, somehow heretics or whatever, and I just find it..., to play the whole thing over onto a, a merely scientific terrain, I also find, again, politically meaningful. Every assertion of criteria, every assertion of starting points, premises, etc., or of theory structures always creates people who don't agree.\n\nH: Yes, they say: It's not so.\n\nL: It is not so, or it is unacceptable to write it that way. And what do you do with them?\n\nH: They're just wrong.\n\nL: Yes, if you assert a normative basis for your theory. If you don't do that, as I'm trying to do, then you say: then suggest something, do it better, make a better theory, which brings your points of view more to the fore or whatever.\n\nH: A theory without normative foundations - is that even possible?\n\nL: I think so. That is, of course, it depends on what you mean by normative. But if, at the same time, one prescribes with the theory that others must accept it or fall into some zone of badness, of intemperance, of.... (I don't know how you want to classify it), then I think, first of all, that is not scientifically seen, because you would have to give the others the chance to do it better, from their preferences, and besides, you don't need that at all. And that's what I mean by the political or moral content of theory. If they claim that, they classify their opponents with it, and I want to avoid that. "
