Elm isn’t JavaScript, so you’ll have some new skills to learn. “Elm in action” teaches you the Elm language along with a new approach to coding frontend applications. Chapter by chapter, you’ll create a full-featured photo-browsing app, learning as you go about Elm’s modular architecture, Elm testing, and how to work seamlessly with your favorite JavaScript libraries.
