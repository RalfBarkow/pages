        "text": "The behavioral patterns appropriate to the most advanced level of technical development are not limited to the sectors in which they are actually required. Thus, [[thinking]] does not merely submit to social performance control where it is imposed on him professionally, but adapts his entire complexion to it. Because thought is turned into the solution of assigned tasks, even that which is not assigned is treated according to [[the scheme of the task]]. The thought, which lost autonomy, no longer dares to comprehend reality for its own sake in freedom. It leaves that with respectful illusion to the highest paid and makes itself measurable for it. He tends to behave of his own accord, as if he constantly had to prove his fitness. Even where there is nothing to crack, thinking becomes a training for any exercises to be taken. To its objects it behaves as to mere hurdles, as a permanent test of its own being in form. Reflections, which are relationship to the thing and thus to oneself, challenge the suspicion that they are vain, windy, asocial masturbation. Just as for the neopositivists cognition splits into the accumulated empiricism and the logical formalism, so the intellectual activity of the type to whom the unified science is written on the body polarizes itself into the inventory of the known and the sample of thinking ability: every thought becomes for them a quiz of either informedness or aptitude. Somewhere the right answers must already be listed. Instrumentalism, the most recent version of pragmatism, has long since no longer merely a matter of the application of thought, but the apriori of its own form. When oppositional intellectuals want to change the content of society from such a spell, they paralyze the shape of their own consciousness, which is modeled in advance according to the needs of this society. While the thought has forgotten to think itself, it has become at the same time the absolute examining instance of itself. Thinking means nothing else than to watch over every moment whether one can also think. Hence the suffocation of every apparently independent intellectual production, of the theoretical no less than of the artistic. The socialization of the mind keeps it covered, banished, under glass, as long as society itself is imprisoned. As thinking before internalized the individual duties commanded from the outside, so today it has internalized its integration into the comprehensive apparatus. into the comprehensive apparatus and is perishing from it and perishes from it, even before the economic economic and political verdicts hit it hard enough."
