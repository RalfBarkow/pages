      "text": "The concept of organization only gained clearer contours in the second half of the 19th century. In the Middle Ages, a special term for what we now call organizations had been unnecessary. Nor would it have had any object, for social order was guaranteed by the stratification of family households and by corporations and, moreover, was subject to a variety of legal regulations. It was not until the course of the 19th century that a usage of language was consolidated that distinguished organizations as social formations of a special kind from other social orders (for example, from communities or from social classes). Only since then has the term organization also been used in normal everyday and scientific language to designate an object of a special kind. Already often used in the 18th century, it initially denotes the order of organic life as distinct from artifacts and mechanisms. Jean Paul still considers the application of the term organization to non-organic facts to be a metaphorical use of language, but he himself also speaks of the organization of texts, in the sense of an active-ordering production. Perhaps, then, the transition to an active, activity-related use of the word is the process that generalizes the term. In any case, the term organization has at first a cosmological breadth and remains related to the \"organic\" scheme of the whole and its parts, but offers the possibility to designate at the same time an activity and its effect *without getting involved in this difference*."

      "text": "Since the 18th century generally tended to replace hierarchical distinctions by the distinction of \"inside\" and \"outside\", one also finds the distinction of inner and outer references already in the word field of organization. This then also allows to introduce the concept of disorganization – detached from any hierarchical world architecture and related to internal defects of an organism. At about the same time, biology and demography adjust to a new concept of \"population\" related to individuals, which takes much of the meaning away from the old scheme of species and genera and prepares the theory of evolution of the 19th century. For the explication of the internal organization, however, it remained with the scheme of a whole consisting of parts, that is, with the presupposition of a harmony attuned to it, almost still in the old sense of an ordinata concordantia. And then one could also use the distinction between ends and means and say that the arrangement into a whole is the end and the connection of the parts is the means. This in turn allowed Kant to introduce fuzzy concepts like \"interaction\" between parts and the idea that the whole is its own end."
