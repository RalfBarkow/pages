For example, we would like to remove our dependence on jQuery UI things and probably jQuery itself. Those dependencies are wrapped around core pieces of the code. But I found that GT does not have abstractions that understand Coffeescript to match what's available for Java. So I would have to either implement a coffescript thing in GT while also learning GT. Or I would have to untangle the coffeescript knot myself so that I could use the Javascript support as a path to learning GT. That was all more than I could fit into my limited free time for hacking these things."

He has in the notes explained why he wanted diagrams to span multiple sites. I am satisfied that he knows what he is doing. If I had a good list of the tools & method(s) I would share it. There are many candidates for such a list but they all push a little beyond what we expect of wiki text in various ways. As a consequence frequent needs are met in different ways and the ways don't work gracefully together. I am reminded of the XKCD cartoon where the engineer attempts to unify 14 different standards and finds that he now has 15 different standards.\n\nAt New Relic I built and maintained a large heterogenous model from which I could query and diagram useful relationships addressing a large number of interests. For several years now I have been exploring how federated wiki's data mechanisms could duplicate and improve on that work. Each has a simple model: nodes and edges in one case, pages and links in the other. The most essential difference is their approach to scale. At New Relic I built on Neo4j, a performant graph database. I was rewarded by ability to write queries that spanned forty distinct systems, from production, to development and management. This meant that I had thus turned one job into forty. Oops.\n\nThe Hypertext Super Collaborator explored the best of our more recent approaches to integrating nodes and edges, what ever they might represent. Through this I discovered that assembling small graphs into the graph you need in the moment is both easier and more maintainable than extracting the graph you need out of a huge and creaky database as I have done before. So now it is time to bring the best of the super collaborator back into wiki and hopefully support it graceful interoperability with many sources. Let me describe two cooperating mechanisms: Site Survey and Merged Graph Browsing. Rather than explain each, I will point instead to works that exemplify the capabilities.\n\nA Site Survey probes every page of a site collecting recognizable content into a single object attached to the script that will refresh it. My first probe looked for mentions of amateur radio callsigns. Mine is K9OX. A more interesting survey is the Image Caption Survey with finds images on pages and indexes their captions. I inferred connections between pages when they held similarly captioned images. I also used the unique identifiers generated by the Image plugin to relate pages that included the same image, perhaps scaled differently and with a modified caption. I have one page that summaries these Photo Aggregations with links to the code that constructs them from the surveys.\n\nThe most outstanding feature of the super collaborator was its ability to merge many related graphs into one, apply one of several color schemes to the result, and then browse any or all of it with intuitive zoom controls. A less outstanding feature was that it was built upon the Croquet synchronous event distribution model that didn't seem to help anyone. I've now extracted the graphic parts of that codebase as the Solo Super Collaborator and fed the problem of the moment, understanding the intricacies of our federation search, in a series of four graphs. I'm using a variation of Site Survey to index source code files clickable to the line of code implementing any important relation. You can try this by clicking any edge label in one of the generated svg documents. Most recently I've shown that I can similarly index html scripts that query and format search results. This means that I can compose in a single diagram, both the client and server halves of this system.\n\nAgain I have spent an early morning writing about two of the four or five most interesting things happening in this space. I thank you for your attention."

      "text": "mike_hales\nAls Antwort auf \nmike_hales\nWard\nMike touches on a circumstance that brings to mind what it means to create something that is whole in itself within a collaborative work. (I should be catching two more hours of sleep before my 5am flight home from France. But here I am, at my keyboard, exploring the basis of Mike's desire.)\n\nbut not necessarily inside the same site as the diagram\n\nI think Mike wants to include on a page an item that is full of nodes and their relations where each node behaves as an internal link when clicked. We distinguish internal links that add to the lineup from external links that open in a new tab. Internal links \"resolve\" within a context, typically the fork history of the page, where the title is assumed to be sufficient to identify the desired version where there might be many authors who use the same title to mean different things.\n\nThe short answer for Mike is to assemble all of the pages you want to be internal into the wiki where you want them. Then the Graphviz plugin will promptly find the page you want from the title you provide. The same holds true for SVG diagrams from other drawing tools. These are \"enriched\" by source tool specific ways such that the HTML plugin behaves just as the Graphviz plugin when titles are clicked.\n\nI sense that such elaborate forking is seen as undesirable overhead to be avoided. Is this because the content would clutter the site with marginal material from the point of view of a given site? How has this come to be? Perhaps the remote pages are written in such a way that they don't \"work\" outside their remote site? We might find that the remote author has been careless enough to write pages that do not carry with them the context that Mike wants to cite.\n\nMike could fork the deficient pages and add to his versions the missing context. In this case Mike would be doing extra work so that his reader will have that work done. When there are many pages with this deficiency the sum can be a substantial effort. Maybe we can devise some workflow and script automation to make this work its own distinct activity. But first I should mention a well developed alternative from Thompson's experience.\n\nWhen Thompson launches a collaborative writing project he insists that his collaborating authors master the \"modular\" style that drives the emergent consensus of meaning. He has written about this as a set of modularity induing practices that to my mind reduce to \"say one thing and say it well\".\n\nI have, with Paul's help, made several runs at publishing scripts that will bring each authors work together automatically. The authors find this helpful in their own writing but our solutions have broken down when selectively assembling each authors work in order to make one readable book. No tool we have yet devised does this work correctly. Thompson now understands that if the book is to be whole he as editor must make it so. This he does in yet another wiki with this sole purpose.\n\nI understand that Mike's ask is smaller. He wants to make a diagram that is \"whole\" in that it reaches across sites so his reader can experience what he experiences as he moves from site to site. This is Thompson's problem in miniature. Mike's need may be more solvable than the challenge for which Paul and I failed. I encourage speculation. But don't think less of the Graphviz and HTML plugins if they don't do this organizational work automatically.\n\nThanks \nWard\n for a Big Thought (at the airport!). And \nThompson\n for expanding."

The Welcome visitors roster reveals the other stubs.\nWhen I first sought out Ward's help to develop a pattern language to share guiding wisdom from what I had learned in Dayton, he redirected me to the fedwiki, from which I could think more deeply, allowing, eventually, my first book to unfold.\n\nIt was from Takashi Iba that I learned the art of pattern making, one influenced by the emergent nature of the KJ Method. Rather that seeking to write a comprehensive pattern set, I challenge myself instead to write a 'smallest viable pattern', one that would allow others to be guided toward the feeling of that mysterious essence of aliveness which Alexander called \"quality without a name\", one that might allow a larger unfolding. It's working.\n\nTo understand how to guide others into practices that allowed this vital unfolding, I sought out Alexander's later work, where he defined what he called the \"15 properties\". Learning from Takashi's masterwork of his pattern language to write pattern languages, I allowed my intuition to guide me to an originating three essences of these properties that might unfold systems that felt alive, which I called 'beauty' that was comprised of 'wholeness', 'goodness' and 'delight'.\n\nI have now guided others into this unfolding, giving me confidence of its transformative potential.\n\nI share all of this to encourage you not to overthink, but to experiment and experience, to 'learn into' an unfolding that feels alive.\n\nStart small and watch for that which can't be named but is deeply felt."

        "text": "mike_hales\nAls Antwort auf \nmike_hales\nWard\nMike touches on a circumstance that brings to mind what it means to create something that is whole in itself within a collaborative work. (I should be catching two more hours of sleep before my 5am flight home from France. But here I am, at my keyboard, exploring the basis of Mike's desire.)\n\nbut not necessarily inside the same site as the diagram\n\nI think Mike wants to include on a page an item that is full of nodes and their relations where each node behaves as an internal link when clicked. We distinguish internal links that add to the lineup from external links that open in a new tab. Internal links \"resolve\" within a context, typically the fork history of the page, where the title is assumed to be sufficient to identify the desired version where there might be many authors who use the same title to mean different things.\n\nThe short answer for Mike is to assemble all of the pages you want to be internal into the wiki where you want them. Then the Graphviz plugin will promptly find the page you want from the title you provide. The same holds true for SVG diagrams from other drawing tools. These are \"enriched\" by source tool specific ways such that the HTML plugin behaves just as the Graphviz plugin when titles are clicked.\n\nI sense that such elaborate forking is seen as undesirable overhead to be avoided. Is this because the content would clutter the site with marginal material from the point of view of a given site? How has this come to be? Perhaps the remote pages are written in such a way that they don't \"work\" outside their remote site? We might find that the remote author has been careless enough to write pages that do not carry with them the context that Mike wants to cite.\n\nMike could fork the deficient pages and add to his versions the missing context. In this case Mike would be doing extra work so that his reader will have that work done. When there are many pages with this deficiency the sum can be a substantial effort. Maybe we can devise some workflow and script automation to make this work its own distinct activity. But first I should mention a well developed alternative from Thompson's experience.\n\nWhen Thompson launches a collaborative writing project he insists that his collaborating authors master the \"modular\" style that drives the emergent consensus of meaning. He has written about this as a set of modularity induing practices that to my mind reduce to \"say one thing and say it well\".\n\nI have, with Paul's help, made several runs at publishing scripts that will bring each authors work together automatically. The authors find this helpful in their own writing but our solutions have broken down when selectively assembling each authors work in order to make one readable book. No tool we have yet devised does this work correctly. Thompson now understands that if the book is to be whole he as editor must make it so. This he does in yet another wiki with this sole purpose.\n\nI understand that Mike's ask is smaller. He wants to make a diagram that is \"whole\" in that it reaches across sites so his reader can experience what he experiences as he moves from site to site. This is Thompson's problem in miniature. Mike's need may be more solvable than the challenge for which Paul and I failed. I encourage speculation. But don't think less of the Graphviz and HTML plugins if they don't do this organizational work automatically.\n\nThanks \nWard\n for a Big Thought (at the airport!). And \nThompson\n for expanding.\n\nMy project is for a pattern language which I guess might have something like 40 major pattern families. Each has a distinct orientation and 'feel'. To get started I mean to tactically focus on a handful of these. And rather than writing full-format Alexandrian patterns, I mean to write a narrative frame (like Alexander did).\n\nThe aim of the writing is to frame a field of evolutionary investigation, into which I can invite collaborators. THEN we might get seriously into pattern descriptions.\n\nAls Antwort auf \nWard\nmike_hales\nThanks \nWard\n for a Big Thought (at the airport!).

The wikis are represented by the document icon. You can see the kind of cross-linking that I anticipate between them.\nWhy do I mean to use a family of wikis, rather than forking all content into one site, as \nThompson\n does? Bcos\n\n(a) I'm working on a book-like plan, and need to have an equivalent to sections and chapters. Wiki provides no tools for categorisation in this way (part of its elegance 💚). So each separate wiki represents 'a section', with its own particular location and aesthetic orientation, within the weave. The flag constitutes a colour-code for sections.\n(b) Each wiki will be relatively complex, so separating the narrative into seven sites makes for something more bite-sized. Each site can live in its own tab in the browser, for parallel reading and cross-linking across sections.\nEventually we might want to collapse a family of wikis into 'a book' But that's way down the line.

        "text": "mike_hales\nAls Antwort auf \nmike_hales\nWard\nMike touches on a circumstance that brings to mind what it means to create something that is whole in itself within a collaborative work. (I should be catching two more hours of sleep before my 5am flight home from France. But here I am, at my keyboard, exploring the basis of Mike's desire.)\n\nbut not necessarily inside the same site as the diagram\n\nI think Mike wants to include on a page an item that is full of nodes and their relations where each node behaves as an internal link when clicked. We distinguish internal links that add to the lineup from external links that open in a new tab. Internal links \"resolve\" within a context, typically the fork history of the page, where the title is assumed to be sufficient to identify the desired version where there might be many authors who use the same title to mean different things.\n\nThe short answer for Mike is to assemble all of the pages you want to be internal into the wiki where you want them. Then the Graphviz plugin will promptly find the page you want from the title you provide. The same holds true for SVG diagrams from other drawing tools. These are \"enriched\" by source tool specific ways such that the HTML plugin behaves just as the Graphviz plugin when titles are clicked.\n\nI sense that such elaborate forking is seen as undesirable overhead to be avoided. Is this because the content would clutter the site with marginal material from the point of view of a given site? How has this come to be? Perhaps the remote pages are written in such a way that they don't \"work\" outside their remote site? We might find that the remote author has been careless enough to write pages that do not carry with them the context that Mike wants to cite.\n\nMike could fork the deficient pages and add to his versions the missing context. In this case Mike would be doing extra work so that his reader will have that work done. When there are many pages with this deficiency the sum can be a substantial effort. Maybe we can devise some workflow and script automation to make this work its own distinct activity. But first I should mention a well developed alternative from Thompson's experience.\n\nWhen Thompson launches a collaborative writing project he insists that his collaborating authors master the \"modular\" style that drives the emergent consensus of meaning. He has written about this as a set of modularity induing practices that to my mind reduce to \"say one thing and say it well\".\n\nI have, with Paul's help, made several runs at publishing scripts that will bring each authors work together automatically. The authors find this helpful in their own writing but our solutions have broken down when selectively assembling each authors work in order to make one readable book. No tool we have yet devised does this work correctly. Thompson now understands that if the book is to be whole he as editor must make it so. This he does in yet another wiki with this sole purpose.\n\nI understand that Mike's ask is smaller. He wants to make a diagram that is \"whole\" in that it reaches across sites so his reader can experience what he experiences as he moves from site to site. This is Thompson's problem in miniature. Mike's need may be more solvable than the challenge for which Paul and I failed. I encourage speculation. But don't think less of the Graphviz and HTML plugins if they don't do this organizational work automatically.\n\nThanks \nWard\n for a Big Thought (at the airport!). And \nThompson\n for expanding."
