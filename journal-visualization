Very regularly, someone asks why scientific publishing hasn't embraced Web technology. The technical part of the answer is \"because the Web has no notion of a [[Document]]\". So we are stuck with PDF files. If you then ask people what they want to do better than with a PDF, the answers are well summarized by \"make it more of a model\" (add interactive elements, allow updates, comments, ...).\nMy idea for solving this dilemma is models that have documents as components. That's one of the reasons I came to this place."
