In the concept of habitus, these two perspectives are intertwined. In Bourdieu's concept of habitus, both the social structures and the acting actor are related to the analyses of social inequality. From this perspective, the structures operate in and through the agents. Usually, the habitus concept is used to explain educational disadvantage or the reproduction of social inequality. As Bourdieu uses the (class-specific) habitus to explain social practice within conditions of existence shaped by social structures, questions arise when analyzing processes of social advancement: What happens to a person's habitus when the conditions of existence fundamentally change within his or her biography? And: How does it come about that a person 'leaves' his socialization context?"

Based on habitus theory, we reconstruct the processuality of educational success within upward mobility biographies. The central inequality dimensions (1) class-specific origin as well as (2) ethnic origin and (3) gender are usually considered selectively in each case. The present empirical study will analyze these three dimensions of social inequality comparatively in their interacting form within biographies. The concept of habitus is able to maintain a unified perspective in the face of this heterogeneity and multidimensionality. Due to the biographical \"sustainability\" of the origin effect, we reconstruct the educational advancement processes of individuals who (1) come from educationally deprived homes, (2) grew up in materially scarce circumstances and in a disadvantaged residential environment, (3) have obtained an academic degree, and (4) are professionally established. This stark contrast between background and advancement allows for a more contoured account of the challenges in the advancement process. A total of eight narrative-biographical interviews with educational climbers are analyzed in the empirical study presented here.1 These are the biographies of four men and four women, half of whom are of Turkish origin and half of whom are native.2 Through the individual stratifications of experience in the biographies, an attempt is made to work out the experiential spaces that are constitutive for the genesis of the habitus and the transformation of the conditions of origin."
