Plan 9 was an attempt, its designers wrote, “to build a Unix out of little systems. . . not a system out of little Unixes” (Pike et al. 1990). An analogous inversion applies strikingly in the context of Unix and Smalltalk. Rather than running isolated Smalltalks (i.e. Smalltalk VMs), each trapped within a Unix, we seek instead a path towards a Smalltalk built out of the fragmented reality of today’s Unix systems. This requires a mindset hardly envisaged in the 1960s and 1970s: to accept the complex reality of existing software, developed in ignorance of any particular grand design, and to shift our system’s role to constructing views, including Smalltalk-like ones, of this diverse reality.\n"
