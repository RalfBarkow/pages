Individuals engage in problem-solving by considering different options, evaluating their effectiveness, and choosing the most suitable means (solutions) to achieve the desired end (problem resolution).\n\n4. **Dichotomy in Process:** While there isn't a strict dichotomy, the problem-solution process can be viewed as a dynamic interaction between identifying problems and generating solutions. The means-ends framework can be seen as a broader concept that encompasses the problem-solving process.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between means and ends is closely intertwined with problem-solving, and the process of addressing problems often involves navigating the means-ends dynamic. The identification of a problem sets the stage for determining the desired end state, and the means are the strategies or solutions employed to move from the problem to the solution."

DOI 10.1177/14730952221102533. \nPlanning for the common good requires the exercise of phronesis and a fitting ontology of planning situations. This paper critically appraises Flyvbjerg’s Phronetic Planning Research approach through the lens of Aristotelian phronesis and Assemblage Thinking, showing that it inadequately addresses these interdependent issues. It proposes an Assemblage-based Phronetic Planning Approach (APPA) and a methodology to implement it. APPA conceptualizes planning situations as multiplicities comprising assemblages which best represent their complexity, materiality and spatiality and simultaneously enunciate the relationality and situatedness of individual and collective phronesis. APPA offers an immanent approach to study and support the making of public plans. It stresses the co-constitution of phronesis, phronimos, collective phronesis and the situated ‘common good’ within interacting assemblages and entangled planning multiplicities unfolding in a milieu over the planning process. Making good public plans under present and future uncertainty involves steering these multiplicities to foster the emergence of collective phronesis and the good plan that delivers the situated common good. Professional planners and other actors, desiring the ‘successful symbiosis’ of humans and the material world, may strive to become phronimos. Future research needs to engage with the Deleuzoguattarian and Aristotelian scholarship to elucidate critical theoretical issues, develop novel methodologies and analytical tools and empirically test APPA in diverse planning situations and geographical contexts.\n\nBROSSARD, Baptiste and CHANDLER, Amy, 2022.

DOI 10.1177/0361684314537997. \nWe examined how university leaders described what and who needed to change in order to increase the representation of female faculty in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) departments. Thirty-one (28 men and 3 women) STEM departmental chairs and deans at a large, public university participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were examined using both qualitative and quantitative procedures. Analysis focused on participants’ descriptions of responsibility for changes related to gender equity. Using the distinction of high versus low responsibility, themes were examined for their qualitative characteristics as well as their frequency. Leaders who exhibited high personal responsibility most frequently saw themselves as needing to change and also named their male colleagues as concurrently responsible for diversity. Conversely, leaders who exhibited low personal responsibility most frequently described female faculty as responsible and described women’s attitudes and their “choice” to have a family as obstacles to gender diversity in STEM. We argue that the dimensions of high and low responsibility are useful additions to discussions of leadership, workplace diversity initiatives, and gender equity more broadly. To this end, we provide several methodological tools to examine these subtle, yet essential, aspects of how diversity and change efforts are imagined and discussed.\n\nMICHALKO, R., 2008.

DOI 10.1177/00221678211032065. \nIn this article, I reassess two central existential constructs at their intersection with neoliberalism and the self-help industry. Freedom and authenticity, as theorized primarily in the Sartrean tradition, have been commodified by the neoliberal self-help industry into uncritical and universalizing concepts. As these contemporary caricatures of freedom and authenticity become popular, their effects on subjectivity can be problematic. I conduct a reassessment of these constructs to identify where power relations, universality, and misinterpretations not only propagate errors that become embodied in subjectivity but also demarcate inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for diverse subjectivities to access freedom and authenticity.\n\nRAJADESINGU, Suriyaprakash, DEEPANKARA, V., DOWLATH, Mohammed Junaid Hussain, KARUPPANNAN, Sathish Kumar and ARUNACHALAM, Kantha Deivi, 2021.

DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682X.2012.00410.x. \nThe purpose of this article was to identify manifestations of a social discourse that construct those who are homeless as an existential problem. Based on 4 years of ethnographic data and grounded theory analysis, we illustrate the nature of exclusionary social practices that emerge from discourse on the “homeless problem” as well as the conflicting identities experienced by those who are homeless. Herein we frame the data using DuBois concept of “double consciousness.” Our findings indicate that those who are homeless mix together discourses of value and legitimacy with self‐applied stigmas and self‐denigrating political perspectives in ways that directly mirror DuBois’ notion of the conflicting nature of African and American identities around the end of the nineteenth century. We illustrate identity problems that manifest in the contemporary conflict between being both “homeless” and “American.”\n\nWESSELS, Bridgette and DOBSON, John, 2001.

The making of good public plans Phronesis, Phronetic Planning Research and Assemblage Thinking. Planning Theory. February 2023. Vol. 22, no. 1, p. 58–84. DOI 10.1177/14730952221102533. \nPlanning for the common good requires the exercise of phronesis and a fitting ontology of planning situations. This paper critically appraises Flyvbjerg’s Phronetic Planning Research approach through the lens of Aristotelian phronesis and Assemblage Thinking, showing that it inadequately addresses these interdependent issues. It proposes an Assemblage-based Phronetic Planning Approach (APPA) and a methodology to implement it. APPA conceptualizes planning situations as multiplicities comprising assemblages which best represent their complexity, materiality and spatiality and simultaneously enunciate the relationality and situatedness of individual and collective phronesis. APPA offers an immanent approach to study and support the making of public plans. It stresses the co-constitution of phronesis, phronimos, collective phronesis and the situated ‘common good’ within interacting assemblages and entangled planning multiplicities unfolding in a milieu over the planning process. Making good public plans under present and future uncertainty involves steering these multiplicities to foster the emergence of collective phronesis and the good plan that delivers the situated common good. Professional planners and other actors, desiring the ‘successful symbiosis’ of humans and the material world, may strive to become phronimos. Future research needs to engage with the Deleuzoguattarian and Aristotelian scholarship to elucidate critical theoretical issues, develop novel methodologies and analytical tools and empirically test APPA in diverse planning situations and geographical contexts.\n\nBROSSARD, Baptiste and CHANDLER, Amy, 2022.

DOI 10.1177/0361684314537997. \nWe examined how university leaders described what and who needed to change in order to increase the representation of female faculty in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) departments. Thirty-one (28 men and 3 women) STEM departmental chairs and deans at a large, public university participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were examined using both qualitative and quantitative procedures. Analysis focused on participants’ descriptions of responsibility for changes related to gender equity. Using the distinction of high versus low responsibility, themes were examined for their qualitative characteristics as well as their frequency. Leaders who exhibited high personal responsibility most frequently saw themselves as needing to change and also named their male colleagues as concurrently responsible for diversity. Conversely, leaders who exhibited low personal responsibility most frequently described female faculty as responsible and described women’s attitudes and their “choice” to have a family as obstacles to gender diversity in STEM. We argue that the dimensions of high and low responsibility are useful additions to discussions of leadership, workplace diversity initiatives, and gender equity more broadly. To this end, we provide several methodological tools to examine these subtle, yet essential, aspects of how diversity and change efforts are imagined and discussed.\n\nMICHALKO, R., 2008.

DOI 10.1177/00221678211032065. \nIn this article, I reassess two central existential constructs at their intersection with neoliberalism and the self-help industry. Freedom and authenticity, as theorized primarily in the Sartrean tradition, have been commodified by the neoliberal self-help industry into uncritical and universalizing concepts. As these contemporary caricatures of freedom and authenticity become popular, their effects on subjectivity can be problematic. I conduct a reassessment of these constructs to identify where power relations, universality, and misinterpretations not only propagate errors that become embodied in subjectivity but also demarcate inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for diverse subjectivities to access freedom and authenticity.\n\nRAJADESINGU, Suriyaprakash, DEEPANKARA, V., DOWLATH, Mohammed Junaid Hussain, KARUPPANNAN, Sathish Kumar and ARUNACHALAM, Kantha Deivi, 2021.

DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682X.2012.00410.x. \nThe purpose of this article was to identify manifestations of a social discourse that construct those who are homeless as an existential problem. Based on 4 years of ethnographic data and grounded theory analysis, we illustrate the nature of exclusionary social practices that emerge from discourse on the “homeless problem” as well as the conflicting identities experienced by those who are homeless. Herein we frame the data using DuBois concept of “double consciousness.” Our findings indicate that those who are homeless mix together discourses of value and legitimacy with self‐applied stigmas and self‐denigrating political perspectives in ways that directly mirror DuBois’ notion of the conflicting nature of African and American identities around the end of the nineteenth century. We illustrate identity problems that manifest in the contemporary conflict between being both “homeless” and “American.”\n\nWESSELS, Bridgette and DOBSON, John, 2001.

DOI 10.1177/14730952221102533. \nPlanning for the common good requires the exercise of phronesis and a fitting ontology of planning situations. This paper critically appraises Flyvbjerg’s Phronetic Planning Research approach through the lens of Aristotelian phronesis and Assemblage Thinking, showing that it inadequately addresses these interdependent issues. It proposes an Assemblage-based Phronetic Planning Approach (APPA) and a methodology to implement it. APPA conceptualizes planning situations as multiplicities comprising assemblages which best represent their complexity, materiality and spatiality and simultaneously enunciate the relationality and situatedness of individual and collective phronesis. APPA offers an immanent approach to study and support the making of public plans. It stresses the co-constitution of phronesis, phronimos, collective phronesis and the situated ‘common good’ within interacting assemblages and entangled planning multiplicities unfolding in a milieu over the planning process. Making good public plans under present and future uncertainty involves steering these multiplicities to foster the emergence of collective phronesis and the good plan that delivers the situated common good. Professional planners and other actors, desiring the ‘successful symbiosis’ of humans and the material world, may strive to become phronimos. Future research needs to engage with the Deleuzoguattarian and Aristotelian scholarship to elucidate critical theoretical issues, develop novel methodologies and analytical tools and empirically test APPA in diverse planning situations and geographical contexts.\n\nBROSSARD, Baptiste and CHANDLER, Amy, 2022.

DOI 10.1177/0361684314537997. \nWe examined how university leaders described what and who needed to change in order to increase the representation of female faculty in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) departments. Thirty-one (28 men and 3 women) STEM departmental chairs and deans at a large, public university participated in semi-structured interviews. Data were examined using both qualitative and quantitative procedures. Analysis focused on participants’ descriptions of responsibility for changes related to gender equity. Using the distinction of high versus low responsibility, themes were examined for their qualitative characteristics as well as their frequency. Leaders who exhibited high personal responsibility most frequently saw themselves as needing to change and also named their male colleagues as concurrently responsible for diversity. Conversely, leaders who exhibited low personal responsibility most frequently described female faculty as responsible and described women’s attitudes and their “choice” to have a family as obstacles to gender diversity in STEM. We argue that the dimensions of high and low responsibility are useful additions to discussions of leadership, workplace diversity initiatives, and gender equity more broadly. To this end, we provide several methodological tools to examine these subtle, yet essential, aspects of how diversity and change efforts are imagined and discussed.\n\nMICHALKO, R., 2008.

DOI 10.1177/00221678211032065. \nIn this article, I reassess two central existential constructs at their intersection with neoliberalism and the self-help industry. Freedom and authenticity, as theorized primarily in the Sartrean tradition, have been commodified by the neoliberal self-help industry into uncritical and universalizing concepts. As these contemporary caricatures of freedom and authenticity become popular, their effects on subjectivity can be problematic. I conduct a reassessment of these constructs to identify where power relations, universality, and misinterpretations not only propagate errors that become embodied in subjectivity but also demarcate inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for diverse subjectivities to access freedom and authenticity.\n\nRAJADESINGU, Suriyaprakash, DEEPANKARA, V., DOWLATH, Mohammed Junaid Hussain, KARUPPANNAN, Sathish Kumar and ARUNACHALAM, Kantha Deivi, 2021.

Vol. 82, no. 3, p. 331–355. DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682X.2012.00410.x. \nThe purpose of this article was to identify manifestations of a social discourse that construct those who are homeless as an existential problem. Based on 4 years of ethnographic data and grounded theory analysis, we illustrate the nature of exclusionary social practices that emerge from discourse on the “homeless problem” as well as the conflicting identities experienced by those who are homeless. Herein we frame the data using DuBois concept of “double consciousness.” Our findings indicate that those who are homeless mix together discourses of value and legitimacy with self‐applied stigmas and self‐denigrating political perspectives in ways that directly mirror DuBois’ notion of the conflicting nature of African and American identities around the end of the nineteenth century. We illustrate identity problems that manifest in the contemporary conflict between being both “homeless” and “American.”\n\nWESSELS, Bridgette and DOBSON, John, 2001.
