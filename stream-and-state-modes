Therefore, meaning is the basic medium of all forms produced in the system. This is because meaning has a form, too: the form of meaning is the distinction real/possible – or actual/potential. Meaning is the form of selection of social and psychic systems. It is an evolutionary achievement of social and psychic systems that gives form to their →[[self-reference]] and their structured →[[complexity]]. Systems selections, which are based on meaning, actualize something and leave the non-actualized possibilities in the back- ground. Selection is the actualization of something through the →negation of everything else. Negation is not destruction but the fundamental way through which meaning operates.\n"
