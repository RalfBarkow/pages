Once established, principles become the filter through which we judge our actions. They are more than 'beliefs' or opinions – they are informed and highly defensible positions that keep the light on what we do. For principled inquiry teachers, tension can arise when external expectations or initiatives (such as mandatory testing) conflict with these positions. This is why principles are even more effective when they are shared and when they guide the practice of the whole school, not just the individual. Articulating the principles that underpin inquiry-based learning help define and grow a culture of inquiry.\n"
