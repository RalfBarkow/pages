It consists of entities linked to entities linked to entities using various relationships. The problem with the semantic web is that it is disconnected from data. In order to connect it to data and make it highly useful, the entities themselves need some sort of simple generic [[Information Friendly]] technology to define and describe them. I recommend Endemes as a possible technology for bringing together the worlds of data and information. Each endeme is an instance of an [[Endeme Set]]. Each endeme has a very simple generic way of representing data. Most data can be stored in endemes, and that which can't can still have its context described by endemes. Endemes are simultaneously [[Information Friendly]] and [[Data Friendly]]. --[[Jon Grover]]",

It consists of entities linked to entities linked to entities using various relationships. The problem with the semantic web is that it is disconnected from data. In order to connect it to data and make it highly useful, the entities themselves need some sort of simple generic [[Information Friendly]] technology to define and describe them. I recommend Endemes as a possible technology for bringing together the worlds of data and information. Each endeme is an instance of an [[Endeme Set]]. Each endeme has a very simple generic way of representing data. Most data can be stored in endemes, and that which can't can still have its context described by endemes.
