Perhaps the water is too cold and we turn up the thermostat. There is often a delay before the water temperature adjusts. If we are impatient for our shower, we often push the thermostat up again. It feels just right and we jump in…then seconds later the water is scalding! If we were to carry on in this way and overreact we will see chaotic behaviour in the system.  If we understand the delays in the system we will be more cautious with our intervention. ",
