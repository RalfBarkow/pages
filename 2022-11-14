Without constant expansion, capitalism collapses. In a finite world, however, you cannot grow infinitely. And yet the industrialized countries act as if they could consume several planets. As is well known, however, there is only one earth."

In the climate debate, it is always suggested that we already have the solution and that only the political will is lacking. But in fact, so far there is no concept of how to end capitalism peacefully. There are only arguments about non-solutions. So far, governments are betting that they can somehow reconcile the economy and climate protection. The typical buzzwords are \"Green New Deal\" or \"decoupling\" growth and energy. The great hope is that the entire economy could be converted to green power – whether transport, industry or heating."

This statement may come as a surprise at first, after all, the sun sends 5,000 times more energy to the earth than the eight billion people would need if they were all to enjoy the standard of living of Europeans. So there is no lack of physical energy, but as we know, solar energy must first be captured. Solar panels and wind turbines, however, only provide electricity when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. To provide for lulls and darkness, energy must be stored – and this intermediate step is so costly that green power will remain scarce. If green energy is to last, the only option is \"green shrinking\"."

They fear that other countries might even take advantage if we reduce our greenhouse gases. For example, economist Hans Werner Sinn writes, \"Whether you think about coal, oil or natural gas, if Germany buys and burns less, then the Chinese can just buy and burn more.\" This mistrust is understandable, but it fails to recognize that almost all other countries are suffering from the climate catastrophe to an even greater extent than Germany. It is in their own interest to reduce greenhouse gases as well."

      "text": "The core error of market-oriented economists is that they think green energy is a normal product that can be multiplied at will as demand increases. So they believe that only \"price signals\" would be needed to force the expansion of wind turbines and solar panels. The idea is that if CO2 taxes are high enough, fossil energy will become so expensive that all companies and households will enthusiastically switch to green energy. But green energy cannot be increased at will – it will remain scarce, if only for physical and technical reasons. Green technology not only consumes steel, concrete and aluminum, which have been in sufficient supply up to now, but also rather scarce minerals. These include lithium, nickel, copper, cobalt, manganese, graphite and rare earths such as neodymium. Just for comparison: a conventional car needs 35 kilos of these raw materials, while an e-car needs around 210 kilos – six times as much. Wind turbines don't turn on their own either. More than 10,000 kilograms of minerals are needed per megawatt of installed power, and when the rotors are in the sea, the figure is as high as 15,000 kilograms. Solar panels do not require quite as many raw materials, but they also come to 7,000 kilos. Conventional power plants are much more economical: if coal is burned, 2500 kilos of minerals are needed per megawatt; with gas, it's only 1200 kilos. The demand for minerals will therefore explode if the entire world wants to operate on a climate-neutral basis. The International Energy Agency predicts that demand for copper will more than double by 2040, while that for lithium will increase 42-fold, graphite 25-fold, cobalt 21-fold, nickel 19-fold and rare earths seven-fold. But economists do not deal with these very concrete questions; they remain in their theoretical world of prices."

It was by no means the only war economy that has ever existed in world history. At the moment, Putin's brutal attack on Ukraine shows that every military conflict has dramatic consequences for the economy as well. Moreover, in a single war, there can be multiple models of how the economy is reshaped. In World War II, not only the British and Americans, but also Hitler and Stalin each had their own forms of a war economy. Not every war economy is therefore suitable as an analogy for how an ecological transformation could be designed."

Almost overnight, a planned economy was created that worked remarkably well. Factories remained in private hands, but the state controlled production - and organized the distribution of scarce goods. There was rationing, but there were no shortages. The British thus invented a private and democratic planned economy that had nothing to do with the dysfunctional socialism in the Soviet Union."

But there are some parallels that are very instructive for a sustainable future. For in the case of the British wartime economy from 1939 onward, several factors come together to make it interesting as a stimulus. First, the British lived in a democracy; their Prime Minister Churchill was freely elected. An \"eco-dictatorship\" is rightly feared, but as the British proved, democracies are also capable of decisive action. Second, the British were not waging a war of aggression, but had to defend themselves against Hitler. They were in an involuntary emergency situation, which, moreover, was recognized belatedly. For a long time, the British had still hoped that they could pacify Hitler through \"appeasement\" and keep him from going to war. We are experiencing climate change in a similar way today. Its dramatic nature was only understood with a delay, but now forces us to act. Third, the British had to sharply downsize their normal economy in a very short time to free up capacity in factories to produce military goods. There is a lesson to be learned from all this about how to organize a shrinking economy."

However, the word \"war\" is used here only as a metaphor and is intended to emphasize that maximum effort is required. It was also common during the Corona pandemic to draw military comparisons. U.S. President Trump - after long downplaying the virus - said in a press conference, \"We're at war, and we're fighting an invisible enemy.\" French President Macron also saw himself at war, requiring \"general mobilization,\" while Britain's Queen Elizabeth II spoke of caregivers \"on the front lines.\" This time, the analogies to World War II were literal, and some states even reactivated wartime ordinances. Trump, for example, brought back the \"Defense Production Act,\" which had been enacted in 1950 during the Korean War to force the car company General Motors to produce ventilators. Just as tanks had once been produced for battle, masks and vaccines were now considered \"weapons against the virus.\" And, as in wartime, the state took all the important decisions: within days, schools and restaurants were closed, employees were sent to the home office, huge rescue packages were put together and borders were partially sealed off. Money was no longer an issue; the only thing that mattered was \"victory\" against the pandemic. This showed that the state can act when it wants to."

Among other things, the Americans built an aircraft factory in Michigan in just six months that produced 24 B24 bombers a day, although each plane required 1,225,000 parts and 313,237 rivets. Similarly impressive was U.S. production of the standardized \"Liberty\" freighters. These ships were intended to compensate for losses incurred by German U-boats in the Atlantic. Initially, it took eight months to produce a single freighter, which consisted of 250,000 parts. In the end, one ship was built every five days. At the same time, existing factories were simply repurposed: Heating companies made helmets, underwear became camouflage nets, calculating machines turned into guns, and vacuum cleaner bags found themselves in gas masks. The fabrics for car seats became parachutes, while car companies built machine guns and cannons, fighter planes and tanks. Between 1942 and 1945, the U.S. government spent more money than it had used in total from 1789 to 1941. During the war years, the U.S. produced 87,000 naval ships, 300,000 aircraft, 100,000 armored vehicles and tanks, and 44 billion rounds of ammunition. Even U.S. President Roosevelt marveled at this \"miracle of production.\""

The Americans did have to cut back a bit during the war, as companies no longer manufactured cars or nylon pantyhose, but instead produced tanks and parachute silk. But overall, the sacrifices were limited. There was still more than one kilo of meat per person and week - which is exactly the amount that Germans eat today on a weekly average. The actual rearmament was also easily financed. Although the military consumed up to 42 percent of economic output, the overall economy expanded much faster. In the U.S., it grew by 90.5 percent overall, and in Canada it doubled by more than 100 percent. North Americans got richer in the war."

Of course, the maximum we have to invest in is wind turbines, solar panels, heat pumps, electrolysers, power grids, railroad tracks or batteries – in that respect, the comparison with the American mobilization in World War II is apt. But rapid and exorbitant growth must not result. The British wartime economy is therefore better suited to provide a model for the future. For in the United Kingdom, civilian production actually had to shrink sharply to free up capacity for the military. The war took up about 50 percent of British economic output – which hardly expanded at all during this period. From 1939 to 1945, overall growth reached only 27 percent. Although the British were able to import weapons and goods from North America and the Commonwealth as well, these were nowhere near enough to maintain peacetime living standards.

They possessed the largest fleet and the largest aircraft production in the world. The army was small, but fully motorized. No British soldier walked on foot; they all sat in armored cars. In September 1940, therefore, the British military leadership still believed that victory could be expected as early as 1942. Instead, it turned out to be five agonizingly long years."

The need was far greater than in peacetime because German bombs destroyed more than a million British homes.

In the past 80 years, the German economy has grown tenfold in real terms. Even if only half of this enormous prosperity remained, we would still be as rich as we were in 1978. Those who were around at that time remember: \"Star Wars\" filled the movie theaters, and Argentina became soccer world champion. Kids played with Bonanza wheels and Slime. Life felt little different than it does today, but it was a bit more leisurely. Instead of jetting off to Mallorca several times for a long weekend, people drove their own cars to Italy once a year for three weeks. In a carbon-neutral world, you'd be traveling by train, but vacations would still be a given."

The \"share economy\" has already developed beguiling visions of what a comfortable life could look like that consumes only as much as can be recycled. The goal is clear, only the path is missing. So far, there is no plan for how to end the dynamic growth of capitalism without threatening a severe economic crisis. The British wartime economy could provide such a model: It shows how a private planned economy can shrink civilian production in an orderly manner - and how scarce goods can then be rationed so that social peace is maintained."

Even under capitalism, there has always been planning - by companies and by governments. The British demonstrated during World War II how a government can effectively steer to radically transform the economy. However, the British wartime economy could only work so well because it did not introduce anything radically new, but only radicalized what was already inherent in capitalism. For even if market radicals like to suppress it: Even in normal times, the state plays a supporting role. Therefore, it would be possible at any time to switch back to a kind of war economy in order to save the climate. True to the motto: learning from the experience of capitalism means learning to win."

So far, governments are betting that they can somehow reconcile the economy and climate protection. The typical buzzwords are \"Green New Deal\" or \"decoupling\" growth and energy. The great hope is that the entire economy could be converted to green power - whether transport, industry or heating."

More than 10,000 kilograms of minerals are needed per megawatt of installed power, and when the rotors are in the sea, the figure is as high as 15,000 kilograms. Solar panels do not require quite as many raw materials, but they also come to 7,000 kilos. Conventional power plants are much more economical: if coal is burned, 2500 kilos of minerals are needed per megawatt; with gas, it's only 1200 kilos. The demand for minerals will therefore explode if the entire world wants to operate on a climate-neutral basis. The International Energy Agency predicts that demand for copper will more than double by 2040, while that for lithium will increase 42-fold, graphite 25-fold, cobalt 21-fold, nickel 19-fold and rare earths seven-fold. But economists do not deal with these very concrete questions; they remain in their theoretical world of prices."

Nicht jede Kriegswirtschaft eignet sich also als Analogie, wie sich eine ökologische Transformation gestalten ließe."

Moreover, in a single war, there can be multiple models of how the economy is reshaped. In World War II, not only the British and Americans, but also Hitler and Stalin each had their own forms of a war economy. Not every war economy is therefore suitable as an analogy for how an ecological transformation could be designed."

Almost overnight, a planned economy was created that worked remarkably well. Factories remained in private hands, but the state controlled production - and organized the distribution of scarce goods. There was rationing, but there were no shortages. The British thus invented a private and democratic planned economy that had nothing to do with the dysfunctional socialism in the Soviet Union."

However, the word \"war\" is used here only as a metaphor and is intended to emphasize that maximum effort is required. It was also common during the Corona pandemic to draw military comparisons. U.S. President Trump - after long downplaying the virus - said in a press conference, \"We're at war, and we're fighting an invisible enemy.\" French President Macron also saw himself at war, requiring \"general mobilization,\" while Britain's Queen Elizabeth II spoke of caregivers \"on the front lines.\" This time, the analogies to World War II were literal, and some states even reactivated wartime ordinances. Trump, for example, brought back the \"Defense Production Act,\" which had been enacted in 1950 during the Korean War to force the car company General Motors to produce ventilators. Just as tanks had once been produced for battle, masks and vaccines were now considered \"weapons against the virus.\" And, as in wartime, the state took all the important decisions: within days, schools and restaurants were closed, employees were sent to the home office, huge rescue packages were put together and borders were partially sealed off. Money was no longer an issue; the only thing that mattered was \"victory\" against the pandemic. This showed that the state can act when it wants to."

The actual rearmament was also easily financed. Although the military consumed up to 42 percent of economic output, the overall economy expanded much faster. In the U.S., it grew by 90.5 percent overall, and in Canada it doubled by more than 100 percent. North Americans got richer in the war."

Nevertheless, the British agreed to the \"Munich Agreement\" in September 1938. The Germans were allowed to occupy the Sudetenland, while Hitler promised to respect the sovereignty of the rest of Czechoslovakia. That this was a sham was not understood by most British until March 15, 1939, when German tanks rolled into Prague."

But at that time, in fact, it hardly seemed conceivable that Hitler would want to start another world war. For it was clear that he would lose this war. The German Reich was simply too poor to subjugate all of Europe. The British, on the other hand, were a military superpower at the time. They possessed the largest fleet and the largest aircraft production in the world. The army was small, but fully motorized. No British soldier walked on foot; they all sat in armored cars. In September 1940, therefore, the British military leadership still believed that victory could be expected as early as 1942. Instead, it turned out to be five agonizingly long years."

In 1939, therefore, the British did not waste any more precious time, but immediately organized a kind of \"private planned economy\". The state specified what was to be produced - but the companies remained the property of their owners. Companies, craft businesses, restaurants or stores were not nationalized, but could continue to decide for themselves how to run their businesses."

The British government, on the other hand, directed the factories indirectly - by allocating raw materials, credit and labor. Above all, employees were in such short supply that companies could only produce if they were allocated employees: The \"manpower budget\" became the government's central control instrument."

Economists, scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs were specifically hired. Initially, however, the necessary figures were lacking to be able to plan at all. National accounts did not yet exist. No one could say how many weapons, airplanes and tanks could be produced without the population having to starve."

Its success was so resounding that it was later adopted by almost all countries worldwide: GDP has become the most important statistical variable in economics because it measures economic performance and thus growth. Thanks to GDP, it was now possible to accurately estimate that 66 percent of British industrial capacity was needed to arm the military, leaving hardly any goods for the civilian population. The need was far greater than in peacetime because German bombs destroyed more than a million British homes. In addition, food supplies had to be cut because Britain was not self-sufficient and was dependent on imports for 70 percent of its food. These imports absolutely had to fall because ships were now needed to bring in weapons and military raw materials from overseas. Foodstuffs cost valuable space."

This point system also applied to furniture and clothes. To save materials and labor, they were standardized so that chairs or plates always looked the same. There were also strict rules for clothes, so that no unnecessary ornaments were sewn on. For example, a woman's dress could only have a maximum of two pockets and five buttons.

In retrospect, the war was glorified as a \"time of public spirit,\" \"in which class and status differences faded and the nameless was as important as the prince.\""

So far, there is no plan for how to end the dynamic growth of capitalism without threatening a severe economic crisis. The British wartime economy could provide such a model: It shows how a private planned economy can shrink civilian production in an orderly manner - and how scarce goods can then be rationed so that social peace is maintained."

Even under capitalism, there has always been planning - by companies and by governments. The British demonstrated during World War II how a government can effectively steer to radically transform the economy. However, the British wartime economy could only work so well because it did not introduce anything radically new, but only radicalized what was already inherent in capitalism. For even if market radicals like to suppress it: Even in normal times, the state plays a supporting role. Therefore, it would be possible at any time to switch back to a kind of war economy in order to save the climate. True to the motto: learning from the experience of capitalism means learning to win."

This statement may come as a surprise at first, after all, the sun sends 5,000 times more energy to the earth than the eight billion people would need if they were all to enjoy the standard of living of Europeans. So there is no lack of physical energy, but as we know, solar energy must first be captured. Solar panels and wind turbines, however, only provide electricity when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing. To provide for lulls and darkness, energy must be stored – and this intermediate step is so costly that green power will remain scarce. If green energy is to last, the only option is \"green shrinking\"."
