Even if you do need to rewrite from scratch - and I have had to rewrite legacy subsystems more than once - you still need to refactor and change your view as you go. I quail when I see a bunch of people come in to sort something out with a Big Picture. <i>There is no Big Picture(tm) in many business organizations.</i> Or, at the least, the Big Picture(tm) doesn't give you a nice, neat up-front set of criteria and a gameplan.

You feel your way, building a rapport with the customers. You refactor and change your view of what system is required as you go along. Sometimes you junk a few day's worth of exploratory work. If you don't go this way, you'll just waste your time writing lots of nice shiny new programs that the customer doesn't actually need. After all, you might only need to rebuild half of that system.
