[[Cee Plus Plus]] was one of a group of C derivatives, including [[Objective Cee]], [[Object Cee]] (from Apple), and numerous home-brew preprocessors (including one I wrote) that used arrays of function pointers to accomplish method dispatch. In such systems, each method name has to be mapped onto an offset into the array that contains the corresponding function pointer. In order to accomplish this mapping, a name scope must be determined for the method name. The design decision taken by [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] was to make the scope global, resulting in a slight performance increase, and also resulting in a requirement that every class in the ancestor chain be recompiled anytime any class in the chain is modified. Similar decisions were taken about object \"purity\" ([[Bjarne Stroustrup]] was unable or unwilling to work out how to embed native types in a pure object pointer representation, ala [[Smalltalk Language]]), resulting in the proliferation of \"operators\" versus methods, \"primitive types\" versus classes, and so on. [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] didn't understand and didn't want to understand metastructure (and his earlier decisions added so much gratuitous complexity that any metastructure would have been immensely more difficult), and so class objects and a viable runtime model fell by the wayside. With no class objects and no metastructure, \"constructors\" and \"destructors\" became necessary. Like the metastructure decision, [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] didn't understand garbage collectors and had already made the entire edifice so byzantine that any reasonable garbage collector was impossible to build anyway.

Also, passing C function pointers is much slower [<i>and more error-prone</i>] than using generic-style function objects and parameterization.

[[Cee Plus Plus]] was one of a group of C derivatives, including [[Objective Cee]], [[Object Cee]] (from Apple), and numerous home-brew preprocessors (including one I wrote) that used arrays of function pointers to accomplish method dispatch. In such systems, each method name has to be mapped onto an offset into the array that contains the corresponding function pointer. In order to accomplish this mapping, a name scope must be determined for the method name. The design decision taken by [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] was to make the scope global, resulting in a slight performance increase, and also resulting in a requirement that every class in the ancestor chain be recompiled anytime any class in the chain is modified. Similar decisions were taken about object \"purity\" ([[Bjarne Stroustrup]] was unable or unwilling to work out how to embed native types in a pure object pointer representation, ala [[Smalltalk Language]]), resulting in the proliferation of \"operators\" versus methods, \"primitive types\" versus classes, and so on. [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] didn't understand and didn't want to understand metastructure (and his earlier decisions added so much gratuitous complexity that any metastructure would have been immensely more difficult), and so class objects and a viable runtime model fell by the wayside. With no class objects and no metastructure, \"constructors\" and \"destructors\" became necessary. Like the metastructure decision, [[Bjarne Stroustrup]] didn't understand garbage collectors and had already made the entire edifice so byzantine that any reasonable garbage collector was impossible to build anyway.
