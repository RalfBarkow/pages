      "text": "And this word must be understood as etymologically as possible – things are \"laid down\", \"placed\", \"arranged\" in it in such different places that it is impossible to find a space of reception for them and to define a common place below one and the other. The utopias comfort; if they have no real seat, they nevertheless unfold in a wonderful and smooth space, they open cities with wide avenues, well-planted gardens, easily accessible lands, even if their access is chimerical. The heterotopias are disturbing, probably because they secretly undermine language, because they prevent this and that from being named, because they break the common names or interlock them, because they destroy in advance the \"syntax\", and not only the one that constructs the sentences, but the less manifest one that makes the words and things (one before and next to the other) \"stick together\". That is why the utopias allow fables and discourses; they are located in the right line of the language, in the fundamental dimension of the fabula. The heterotopias (so often found in Borges) dry up speech, let the words remain in themselves, deny already in the root any possibility of grammar. They dissolve the myths and strike the lyricism of the sentences with barrenness."
