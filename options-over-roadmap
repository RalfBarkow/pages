A good Agile Roadmap is a lightweight plan drafted as a Backlog to be constantly and gradually refined over time, starting from the top-priority Backlog items, as new learnings emerge and the path ahead reveals itself while doing the work. The Backlog items are defined in terms of outcomes and hypotheses or experiments, and the plan is defined by the priorities instead of deadlines. A good Agile Roadmap is shaped collaboratively between the cross-functional team doing the work and the stakeholders and partners and suppliers involved."
