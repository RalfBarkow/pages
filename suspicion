For communication presupposes the difference between information and communication and presupposes both as contingent. One can then very well communicate something about oneself, about one's own states, moods, attitudes, intentions; but this only in such a way that one presents oneself as a context of information which could also turn out differently. Therefore, communication releases an all-embracing, universal, irremediable suspicion, and all affirming and appeasing only regenerates the suspicion. This also explains that this topic becomes relevant in the course of an increased differentiation of the social system, which then reflects more and more on the peculiarity of communication. The insincerity of sincerity becomes an issue as soon as one experiences society as something that is not held together by natural order but by communication."
