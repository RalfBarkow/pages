For a variety of reasons, artists are interested in sharing not just their final mesh but also their whole workflow, though the common media for sharing has limitations. In this paper, we present 3DFlow, an algorithm that computes continuous summarizations of mesh editing workflows. 3DFlow takes as input a sequence of meshes and outputs a visualization of the workflow summarized at any level of detail. The output is enhanced by highlighting edited regions and, if provided, overlaying visual annotations to indicated the artist's work, e.g. summarizing brush strokes in sculpting. We tested 3DFlow with a large set of inputs using a variety of mesh editing techniques, from digital sculpting to low-poly modeling, and found 3DFlow performed well for all. Furthermore, 3DFlow is independent of the modeling software used because it requires only mesh snapshots, and uses the additional information only for optional overlays. We release 3DFlow as open source for artists to showcase their work and release all our datasets so other researchers can improve upon our work."
