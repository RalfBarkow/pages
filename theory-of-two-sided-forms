Nevertheless, the calculus is not self-referentially empty, but is initially grounded in uncatchable motives for making certain distinctions and subsequently in imaginary values that allow the paradoxes of self-reference to be resolved. On the basis of the various readings of forms already in the Laws of Form, however, it becomes clear that the interpretation of the function of recursion in forms requires further definitional work: Is recursion to be understood merely as the return of the current state at the starting point to the target point or is it (also) about the postulated re-entry of an observer's perspective into itself?"

Shannon (1948) to understand all communication as the communication of information that results probabilistically or possibilistically from the relation of a message to a selection of possible messages (technical: [[Alphabet]]; social: [[Context]]). Communication becomes the communication of the overall state of a system, whatever results from this for the understanding of experience and action."

This view raises questions about the relationship between observation and time: How are sequences of states generated in forms themselves? Furthermore, differences in the understanding of the functional logic of variables in mathematics and sociology are pointed out. The interpretation of forms as circuits fixes the meaning of variables for the operation, while linguistic elements as variables in sociological interpretations must take into account the dynamics of natural language."

Possibly every form, once reintroduced into itself, must be thought of as a transition of form. This makes the calculus of forms a suitable instrument for observing social situations that can be understood as eigenvalues of recursive functions (von Foerster 1993), but which are only preserved in the iterations of the recursions of these eigenvalues and are thus non-identical. This makes every social form a form of a reduction of complexity, which can also re-enter the form and be reflected there."

These include not least the questions of how forms can be written with software support, for example using a typesetting system such as [[LaTeX]], and also how they can be spoken in oral speech. In addition, it is still largely unclear methodologically what kind of variables can be written down in a form expression: Where does one get the labels with which a form computes? And last but not least, one of the aspects still to be clarified is the question of whether form analysis is not fundamentally dependent on procedures of a science of design or \"transformative\" research that seeks its positioning in the object and with the object (Simon 1981, 128 ff.; Defila/Di Giulio 2018)."

In mathematics as in sociology, this means that symmetry breaks can be understood as a form of the production of invariants, which in turn exhibit a multitude of transformations. Similar to geometry and the calculus of forms, invariants with many variants can also be identified in society, which can be traced back to certain laws of their transformation."

While he is thoroughly sceptical of the practice of entering terms or texts as \"variables\" in the forms, because strictly speaking the algebra of form works at best with parameters that in turn indicate marked or unmarked states, the work on form can at least be understood as a design practice that can illustrate forms of meaning that are not accessible to the senses objectively, temporally and socially – i.e. as a relation, as an event and for several viewers."

Every phenomenon *a* becomes determinable as a reflection on itself in the context of a reflection on what is included and excluded. In contrast to the Fourier transformation, which translates aperiodic signals into a continuous spectrum, the Spencer-Brown transformation consists of obtaining discrete signals or differences or forms from a continuous spectrum or medial substrate, whose operations in turn enrich the continuous spectrum. This can be followed by considerations on a general theory of digitization in social systems and with recourse to social networks."

His case study concerns student teams in the educational context of a university, whose discussions revolve around finding out which decisions are expected of them or are possible in their projects based on which decision-making premises. The teams only find a dynamically usable stability when they succeed in reliably distinguishing between decisions and decision premises in the meaning of an intrinsic form. "

The simultaneous observation of both sides, necessary for an understanding of their oscillation, is at best visually possible, while in communication it presupposes sustainability, i.e. sequentiality. With recourse to Jacques Derrida's concept of différance, the article advocates a distinction between violence and critique, insofar as critique is able to abolish the violence inherent in sequentiality. The two-sided form becomes violence when it does not allow for the leeway that the sustainability of the designation of the outside of a distinction inevitably possesses."

This is partly because the mathematical interpretation of the Laws of Form is itself a heterogeneous and dynamic field, but also because it remains unclear what kind of sociology is capable of resonating with the form of differentiation. On both sides, one gets the impression, a rather simple and generally immobile understanding of the other side is cultivated. On both sides, there still seems to be a long way to go to re-entry of the distinction into the form of the distinction. However, this is no reason to give up working on the form. On the contrary, it documents that mathematics and sociology can reinvent themselves when it comes to developing a common understanding of the laws of form. There is no position of the third party for this reinvention from which both could be fruitfully taken into consideration.[1] All that remains is further testing in the empirical and practical field."

However, Niklas Luhmann at least drew inspiration from it for an analysis of form that starts with three assumptions (Luhmann 2002, 76 ff.): 1. the system is a difference of system and environment; 2. each system is realized by only one type of operation; and 3. the system realizes its self-reference and self-organization through a re-entry of its form into the form. Possibly, according to Luhmann, systems theory achieves a higher degree of generality with these assumptions, which makes the system/environment distinction a case among other cases of a \"theory of only one-sidedly usable two-sided forms\" (Luhmann 2002, 76). Critics react skeptically and point out that Luhmann does not refer to Spencer-Brown's entire calculus, but only to the first two and the last two chapters (Hennig 2000). In the international reception to date, the recourse of sociological systems theory to Spencer-Brown's formal calculus is considered a dead end (Fararo 2001a, 306 f.; 2001b; White 2008, 353).the empiricism of hybrids (Kron 2015)."

Nevertheless, the calculus is not self-referentially empty, but is initially grounded in uncatchable motives for making certain distinctions and subsequently in imaginary values that allow the paradoxes of self-reference to be resolved. On the basis of the various readings of forms already in the Laws of Form, however, it becomes clear that the interpretation of the function of recursion in forms requires further definitional work: Is recursion to be understood merely as the return of the current state at the starting point to the target point or is it (also) about the postulated re-entry of an observer's perspective into itself?"

This view raises questions about the relationship between observation and time: How are sequences of states generated in forms themselves? Furthermore, differences in the understanding of the functional logic of variables in mathematics and sociology are pointed out. The interpretation of forms as circuits fixes the meaning of variables for the operation, while linguistic elements as variables in sociological interpretations must take into account the dynamics of natural language."

Damit wird der Formkalkül zu einem geeigneten Instrument, um soziale Situationen zu beobachten, die als Eigenwerte rekursiver Funktionen verstanden werden können (von Foerster 1993), sich jedoch nur in den Iterationen der Rekursionen dieser Eigenwerte und somit nicht-identisch erhalten. Das macht jede soziale Form zur Form einer Reduktion von Komplexität, die ebenfalls in die Form wiedereintreten und dort reflektiert werden kann."

This makes the calculus of forms a suitable instrument for observing social situations that can be understood as eigenvalues of recursive functions (von Foerster 1993), but which are only preserved in the iterations of the recursions of these eigenvalues and are thus non-identical. This makes every social form a form of a reduction of complexity, which can also re-enter the form and be reflected there."

While he is thoroughly sceptical of the practice of entering terms or texts as \"variables\" in the forms, because strictly speaking the algebra of form works at best with parameters that in turn indicate marked or unmarked states, the work on form can at least be understood as a design practice that can illustrate forms of meaning that are not accessible to the senses objectively, temporally and socially - i.e. as a relation, as an event and for several viewers."

The teams only find a dynamically usable stability when they succeed in reliably distinguishing between decisions and decision premises in the meaning of an intrinsic form. Finally, Jan Tobias Fuhrmann takes a critical look at Luhmann's understanding of the two-sided form. The simultaneous observation of both sides, necessary for an understanding of their oscillation, is at best visually possible, while in communication it presupposes sustainability, i.e. sequentiality. With recourse to Jacques Derrida's concept of différance, the article advocates a distinction between violence and critique, insofar as critique is able to abolish the violence inherent in sequentiality.

        "text": "The tension between the mathematics of form and its sociology is hinted at in various aspects in the aforementioned contributions, but is still far from being resolved. This is partly because the mathematical interpretation of the Laws of Form is itself a heterogeneous and dynamic field, but also because it remains unclear what kind of sociology is capable of resonating with the form of differentiation. On both sides, one gets the impression, a rather simple and generally immobile understanding of the other side is cultivated. On both sides, there still seems to be a long way to go to re-entry of the distinction into the form of the distinction. However, this is no reason to give up working on the form. On the contrary, it documents that mathematics and sociology can reinvent themselves when it comes to developing a common understanding of the laws of form. There is no position of the third party for this reinvention from which both could be fruitfully taken into consideration.[1] All that remains is further testing in the empirical and practical field."

Possibly every form, once reintroduced into itself, must be thought of as a transition of form. This makes the calculus of forms a suitable instrument for observing social situations that can be understood as eigenvalues of recursive functions (von Foerster 1993), but which are only preserved in the iterations of the recursions of these eigenvalues and are thus non-identical. This makes every social form a form of a reduction of complexity, which can also re-enter the form and be reflected there."
