At Huntley School of Equitation (a BHS training establishment) the price of a one hour private lesson varied from £20 for a lesson with a BHS Trainee to £43 for a FBHS.

The problem with a group is that there will be different abilities and even in a class of identical abilities we will all feel differently on the day.

On a circle, John will approach the horse, moving with the horses rhythm and tempo, and take up the reins in between the riders’ hands and the horse’s mouth (arm over the horses neck). This allows John to give the horse the contact required and to assess the quality of the rider’s contact. As John is so tall he can do this with any height of horse in all three paces (including a 17hh Irish Draught cross thoroughbred in canter!).",

Most people spend far too little time thinking about how to ride, watching those who ride well, looking at videos of people riding well or reading books about it. You can make up for the small amount of time spent in the saddle and the fact that you probably only ride one horse in this way. So many people never watch anyone else or try and learn except for perhaps a lesson every week or two and then they expect to ride like Carl (Hester) and get cross with their horses when it doesn’t happen.”",
