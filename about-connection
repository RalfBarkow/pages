Again we can have sex mechanically seeking an orgasm (and a lot of humans do) or we can quite literally make love....this takes longer and doesn't always achieve orgasm. In my experience if we seek an orgasm we rarely achieve it.  I don't think it is only riders that haven't experienced it. I think it is a lot of people (women!)"
