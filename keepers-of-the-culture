Elements that individuals let in or let go are epidemic, easily creeping in and fading away in the blink of an eye. This understanding is why we talk about being 'Keepers of the Culture' at Griffin. We know it’s all too easy for a culture to shift negatively or to lose valuable parts if there's slack on the upkeep."

Our social behaviours and the norms we collectively create demonstrate what we believe. Culture influences how we interact, the language we use, and how we think. We are aware that we send deliberate messages to each other and uphold our values when we are conscious of our social behaviour. "

Noticing and responding to slips and declines swiftly is fundamental – hard conversations are well worth the discomfort. Growth comes from inspiring positive change stemming from our why, our vision.

It’s not just about building relationships, it’s about having hard conversations. It’s not just about enacting the culture but being accountable to it. It’s not just about what you do, it’s about constantly retelling the story of why you do it. It’s not just about the individuals, it’s about how they swim together. It’s not about us, it’s about the kids. Our powerful culture is for them. Our culture is shifting the story of school."
