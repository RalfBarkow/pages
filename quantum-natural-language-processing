The advent of the first quantum machines, known as noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, has already allowed researchers to make the first small steps towards exploring practical QNLP, by training models and running simple NLP experiments on quantum hardware (Meichanetzidis et al., 2020; Lorenz et al., 2021). Despite the limited capabilities of the current quantum machines, this early work is important in helping us understand better the process, the technicalities, and the unique nature of this new computational paradigm. At this stage, getting more hands-on experience is crucial in closing the gap that exists between theory and practice, and eventually leading to a point where practical real-world QNLP applications will become a reality."
