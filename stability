      "text": "Systems exhibiting stability are in a state of balance or equilibrium in which a point representing a measurable value of an aspect of the system remains at rest or moves within set boundaries. Such boundaries may be set arbitrarily within a range, such as the setting of a thermostat, or at a particular threshold, such as maintaining stock in inventory. Essential variables are those which must remain stable to insure survival or maintain the identity of the system. A complex system such as an animal ora human being will have a large number of essential variables which must remain within their limits if the system is to survive and prosper.\n\nStable systems are characterized by their ability to return to a state of equilibrium after a disturbance. They often rely on negative (error correcting) feedback to retain or improve their stability. When the system improves its capacity to remain in or return to a stable state, we may say it has adapted to respond to its disturbances.\nWhether a system is seen to be stable or not sometimes depends on the scale of time employed.
