      "text": "A theory which assumes that social systems in general and organizations in particular do not consist of fixed particles (not to mention \"individuals\"), but only of events which, by occurring, already disappear again, gives the time dimension an unusual meaning. The consequences reach very far. They contradict to a considerable extent what one imagines as time on the basis of things, changes and movements, seduced by the perception apparatus of the consciousness. We must therefore take some care to clarify how systems, which consist only of events and must therefore produce other events from moment to moment, deal with time. Only when these modalities of realizing time are sufficiently grasped can we see how in organizations the paradox of decision communication is resolved, namely, distributed to different points in time, each with a different past and future."
