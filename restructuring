      "text": "The concept of *restructuring* can be traced in the psychological literature to the developmental psychologist, [[Jean Piaget]]. The Piagetian structuralist approach maintains that cognitive development is an outcome of underlying structural changes in the cognitive system. Just what constitutes structural change has been a topic of some debate (see Globerson 1986; Karmiloff-Smith 1986). Suffice it to say that there appears to be agreement that not just any change constitutes restructuring. Restructuring is characterized by discontinuous, or qualitative, change as the child moves from stage to stage in development. Each new stage constitutes a new internal organization and not merely the addition of new structural elements."
