The fact that capital, like any economic activity, has something to do with provisioning for an uncertain future, as has been discussed in sociology since [[Max Weber]], not only remains unclear, but is downright obscured by the idea that capital can be reduced to the precondition and result of private strategies of enrichment. Here, Vogl is too quick to follow an economic theory that restricts economic activity to the handling of scarce resources, and to supplement this theory with the Marxist reference to profit interests, without taking into account that both only make sense against the background of a present provision for an unknown future and only deserve to be called calculation for this reason, to which social aspects of overreaching and competition are subordinated just as much as factual aspects of the decision about different investment projects in each case. Vogl reduces the role of the unknown future to occasions for the emergence of passionate speculative opinions, without again sufficiently taking into account that only in the medium of these opinions it can be calculated which investments seem to be worthwhile and which not, and for how long, and for what reasons. The enigmatic ontology of public credit, the mystery of an all-too-fungible money, the political sensibility of finance and thus the monstrosity of central banks are deciphered as soon as one takes a look at the division of labor, which is disputed again and again, within which politics and economics, framed by education, art, law, religion and science, argue about currently promising futures and the necessary provision for them. >> capital politics economics frame education art law religion science"

        "text": "Power as the enforcement of collectively binding decisions in the medium of a threat of force is tied to political institutions that seek to organize the resources and sufficient legitimacy for this threat, but it is not limited to these institutions. But even when it becomes diffuse, as Foucault has shown with his theorem of a \"microphysics of power,\" it remains within political institutions the medium of a calculus of sovereignty that can threaten violence anew at any time in order, for example, to be able to provide for those coercive payments in the form of tax collections without which public credit could not be refinanced and thus could not be collected. Vogl is far from losing sight of the enforcement of political power or even reducing it to the means of the rule of law, but how, against what opposition, and with what Hobbesian promises it is enforced and exercised in each of his historical cases remains open."

The fact that capital, like any economic activity, has something to do with provisioning for an uncertain future, as has been discussed in sociology since Max Weber, not only remains unclear, but is downright obscured by the idea that capital can be reduced to the precondition and result of private strategies of enrichment. Here, Vogl is too quick to follow an economic theory that restricts economic activity to the handling of scarce resources, and to supplement this theory with the Marxist reference to profit interests, without taking into account that both only make sense against the background of a present provision for an unknown future and only deserve to be called calculation for this reason, to which social aspects of overreaching and competition are subordinated just as much as factual aspects of the decision about different investment projects in each case. Vogl reduces the role of the unknown future to occasions for the emergence of passionate speculative opinions, without again sufficiently taking into account that only in the medium of these opinions it can be calculated which investments seem to be worthwhile and which not, and for how long, and for what reasons. The enigmatic ontology of public credit, the mystery of an all-too-fungible money, the political sensibility of finance and thus the monstrosity of central banks are deciphered as soon as one takes a look at the division of labor, which is disputed again and again, within which politics and economics, framed by education, art, law, religion and science, argue about currently promising futures and the necessary provision for them."

        "text": "Vogl stimulates a debate about the singularity of modern finance, which can only be conducted by replacing the image of an overly resolute capitalism with the image of a society open to the future. Machinations of capital remain machinations here as well. However, the economic scope of certain social constellations and the chances of political intervention can be assessed more realistically. To this end, it is not least necessary not to confuse the theorem of a functional differentiation of society with the idea of culturally homogeneous and institutionally coherent subsystems. Systems are more open, more fragile and more \"retrospectively\" (Urs Stäheli) constructed than their reception often implies. From France comes the suggestion to assume a functional differentiation rather on the level of discourses and contexts of reasoning or of domains, i.e. fields of expertise, areas of knowledge, than on the level of actions and communications as assumed by systems theory. This could be worthwhile, because then the view becomes free for the real structure of networks of different practices, organizations, institutions and systems, which are more heterogeneous, hybrid and complex than many modern theories have imagined so far. And this fits Harrison C. White's understanding of a network as a calculus of uncertainty, which makes it possible both to appreciate interests and strategies in their path dependence and to observe them as they confront ongoing threats."
