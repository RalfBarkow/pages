By way of explanation, I can immediately refer to a philosopher who will constantly be the subject of this evening even when he is not explicitly mentioned: [[Martin Heidegger]]. As everyone can read in the first pages of his main work, Sein und Zeit (Being and Time) - and you don't need more than these first pages to understand what else he wrote and said, and why he did it this way and not another way - it is about questioning as the place from which philosophy unfolds: Heidegger, however, would rather bite off his tongue than pose his question as I have done here, because, after all, I am asking for something quite specific, namely for truth, which for Heidegger, and this philosophically quite correctly, is not yet possible at all on the level on which he moves on these first pages. From his point of view, I have taken the second (or third or otherwise fourth) step before the first: and indeed, one can only ask about something specific if one has first clarified what it is about the question itself in the first place. At this point, however, I will not pursue this further, but, quite abitur essay-like, I will resume the question about something certain, i.e. about what truth is."

      "text": "For this purpose, in my first step, so to speak, I want to strip the question of its form, and take up only the single word to which the definiteness of the question is owed: the word truth. What does this word mean - considered on its own? I could now insert a small pause in the manner of a teacher and then ask you to tell me what you have thought of in relation to the meaning of this word. And every answer which contains other than the little word 'nothing', I would have to reject as wrong. Because considered in and for itself it is about a character or sound chain with this word, which just means nothing at all. In order to be able to attain meaning, I must place this word, whether I want to or not, into an environment of other words: I have already named one possibility for this, when I declared all answers, which contained other than the little word 'nothing', as wrong: To be able to know, what truth is, I must know at the same time, what it is not. But, I'll go one step further, I have to consider at the same time not only what is the exact opposite of true, that is, what is false, but to demarcate the concept from everything it does not mean. So: whoever asks about the meaning of the term truth makes a distinction before any answer: he demarcates what he considers to be true from everything that is not true for him - respectively does not even touch the problem of truth. This negation does not only include what is clearly false: this precisely not, because the statement: 'This is false' claims to be a true statement, but also all that equally or even more so, which eludes the clear confrontation of true and false."

By definition, the concept that combines this opposition into a totality is neither a system nor, in turn, an environment. However, this totality must exist - otherwise the distinction would be impossible: there must be something that is differentiated into these two components, here system and environment. Luhmann always very cleverly avoids a direct naming of this whole of the distinction, but, asked more precisely, leaves no doubt where it has its place: namely in the observer, who observes the observers while observing. This observer thus represents in Luhmann what I have found out so far about the concept of truth."

Even before we have made the slightest step in the direction of answering our question of what truth is, we have already learned so much about this concept that we can justifiably say that the common notions of truth blatantly contradict the concept of it."
