Every holon is like a two-faced Janus, the Roman god: one side (the whole) looks down (or inward); the other side (the part) looks up (or outward). Each whole is a part of something greater, and each part is in turn an organizing whole to the elements that constitute it. Koestler believed that everything in a healthy system is organized this way, from the human body, to chemistry to the history of philosophy.\n\nThe concept of holon, however, is closely integrated in Janus with the theory of complex systems as was developed by Ludwig von Bertalanffy and Herbert Simon, both well known investigators and friends of Koestler. Janus put together one of the first broad based arguments for incorporating the theory of complex systems into the philosophy of science and epistemology.

This mode of thought is named after the Roman god Janus, who is depicted with two faces, one looking forward and one looking back, symbolizing the ability to see both past and future, and to simultaneously hold opposing viewpoints.\n\nThe hierarchic mode of thought, on the other hand, is characterized by a more linear, logical, and analytical approach. This mode of thought is focused on categorization, analysis, and synthesis, and is essential for problem-solving and decision-making.\n\nKoestler argues that creativity arises when these two modes of thought interact and complement each other. He suggests that many creative breakthroughs occur when individuals are able to shift between these modes of thought, and that the most successful creative individuals are those who are able to master both modes and use them in a complementary way.\n\nOverall, Koestler's main argument in \"Janus\" is that creativity is a complex and multifaceted process that involves the interaction of different modes of thought, and that understanding the nature of this process is essential for understanding human culture and society."
