        "text": "> […], Jan Tobias Fuhrmann takes a critical look at Luhmann's understanding of the [[Two-Sided Form]]. The simultaneous observation of both sides, necessary for an understanding of their oscillation, is at best visually possible, while in communication it presupposes sustainability, i.e. sequentiality. With recourse to Jacques Derrida's concept of différance, the article advocates a distinction between violence and critique, insofar as critique is able to abolish the violence inherent in sequentiality. The two-sided form becomes violence when it does not allow for the leeway that the sustainability of the designation of the outside of a distinction inevitably possesses."
