Measurement is a mechanism for creating a corporate memory and an aid in answering a variety of questions associated with the enactment of any software process. It helps support project planning (e.g., How much will a new project cost?); it allows us to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the current processes and products (e.g., What is the frequency of certain types of errors?); it provides a rationale for adopting/refining techniques (e.g., What is the impact of the technique XX on the productivity of the projects?); it allows us to evaluate the quality of specific processes and products (e.g., What is the defect density in a specific system after deployment?). Measurement also helps, during the course of a project, to assess its progress, to take corrective action based on this assessment, and to evaluate the impact of such action."
