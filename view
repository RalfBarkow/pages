What I now think is a problem for me, an Achilles Heel if you like, is I am the product of the education system, as are my colleagues, and whilst I might be a 'Constructive Discontent', a strength, I believe, my mindset and leadership capabilities have been heavily influenced by [[Playing the Game]]. The [[False Sanctuary]] I talk about that may be some classrooms is not a criticism. Its a lens to view the world of schooling through and the reasons for the existence of this lens is the same as the reason for my Achilles Heel. Its the educational narrative I've grown up with."
