They do have to be visible, although they can be spotted by anyone immediately, but all you have to do is press a button, and if you see the watermark, you know you're talking to an AI, and if you don't see the watermark, you're either talking to an AI that's breaking the law in a very serious way, or you're talking to a real person, so that's one thing I would definitely do.
