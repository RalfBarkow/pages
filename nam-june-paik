DOI 10.1080/00043249.1985.10792299. Video art is a hybrid adapting and sharing the aesthetics, content, and history of the visual arts, literature, music, film, and—most recently—the computer. It brings together ideas about how to construct a story and how to structure experience, fragmentation, disjunction, and chance based on avant-garde ideas developed over the last 100 years. Yet for all its historical precedents and for all the varieties of criticism to which it is open, video art has proved opaque not only to its critics but also to its practitioners, who frequently do not understand the origins of the structures they share. In reply to a statement by Frank Gillette at the 1974 Open Circuits Conference, Robert Pincus-Witten said: “It is not a medium to which the humankind you are so conscious of has access; it’s an exceptionally inaccessible medium.” More than ten years have passed since that time, but a critical model for video has not yet been constructed.\n"
