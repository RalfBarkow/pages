This label obscures more than it explains, if only because it does not make clear the paradox that characterizes Russia's relationship with its neighbors. The pronounced aggressiveness of the policies of Russia's rulers springs from the weakness of the regime and is an expression of the disruption of Russian society. Moreover, the use of the term imperialism suggests that the Russian leadership is concerned with gaining direct control of other countries and their resources in order to strengthen its own economic potential. In reality, propping up the Belarusian regime hit by Western sanctions and annexing Crimea are grant deals with no prospect of payback. Should the Russian leadership actually try to annex Ukraine, it would be ruinous for the occupying power even without Western sanctions."

In this way, it can appeal to national identity and distract from the extent to which a Great Russian mafia capitalism à la Putin frightens off large circles of the population in the successor states of the Soviet Union. However, the Russian government's aggressive approach documents that it is accusing the West of the opposite of what it accuses it of. It is only because the Putin regime knows exactly how limited the West's interest in its eastern periphery is that it seeks confrontation. Will the calculation work? At any rate, it will hardly fail because of German politics. In Germany, there is a broad cross-party informal alliance of Putin supporters."

This illusion has disgraced itself miserably. But this must not mean that everyone's claim to self-determination and participation in society's wealth is consigned to the dustbin of history."

        "text": "Russian propaganda declares the westward orientation of former real-socialist states to be the result of a systematic \"encirclement policy\". In this way, it can appeal to national identity and distract from the extent to which a Great Russian mafia capitalism à la Putin frightens off large circles of the population in the successor states of the Soviet Union. However, the Russian government's aggressive approach documents that it is accusing the West of the opposite of what it accuses it of. It is only because the Putin regime knows exactly how limited the West's interest in its eastern periphery is that it seeks confrontation. Will the calculation work? At any rate, it will hardly fail because of German politics. In Germany, there is a broad cross-party informal alliance of Putin supporters."

The universalism of Western values, which has always denied itself, has been discarded. Whether the West wants to come to terms with Putin or play his confrontational game, both camps are united by a realpolitik orientation."

        "text": "The departure from the liberal-democratic sense of mission, however, does not make the world a better place at all, but an even scarier one. After the collapse of real socialism, the liberal fairy tale was that democracy and a market economy would open the way to freedom and prosperity for the members of the world society. This illusion has disgraced itself miserably. But this must not mean that everyone's claim to self-determination and participation in society's wealth is consigned to the dustbin of history."
