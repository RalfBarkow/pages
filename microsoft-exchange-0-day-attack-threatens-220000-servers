      "text": "Microsoft researchers said numerous servers have been compromised and approximately 220,000 additional servers worldwide are threatened by two critical vulnerabilities in its Exchange application. One is a server-side request forgery vulnerability, and the other enables remote code execution via PowerShell. The unpatched flaws were identified in August by researchers at the Vietnamese security firm GTSC, who found that an Exchange vulnerability was exploited to infect customer networks with malicious webshells. The GTSC researchers said, &quot;After successfully mastering the exploit, we recorded attacks to collect information and create a foothold in the victim's system. The attack team also used various techniques to create backdoors on the affected system and perform lateral movements to other servers in the system.  Microsoft is working on a patch for the new vulnerabilities."
