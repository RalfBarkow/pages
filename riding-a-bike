In cocreating forward, the tool imbricates the knowledge of all parties involved in the cocreation process such that the concepts, labels, and ideas represent the insights brought forth by researchers, managers, and others involved in the cocreation process. However, such knowledge is fully available in “knowing” and not only in reified concepts in the tool; in other words, “knowing is the epistemic work that is done as part of action or practice, like that of riding a bike” (Cook & Brown, 1999: 387) [⇒[[Generative Dance]]]. One can read about riding a bike, but it is in the act of riding that the knowledge is deployed and further experiential understanding is gained. In the same way, cocreating forward involves anchoring the process in a tool that represents various inputs (or knowledge of different parties) and at the same time allows for imagining potential uses (or knowing). Use is in the future, and hence by focusing on action and imagining use, researchers and managers can move beyond the concerns of the present."

      "text": "> Society faces many wicked problems today such as climate change, income inequality, and biodiversity loss. Not only has business contributed to these problems but it also plays an important role in addressing them. Problems are “wicked” because they are embedded in complex systems that are continuously evolving. As no single actor can understand and solve a wicked problem, prior research has suggested that multiple actors, such as researchers and managers, come together to cocreate solutions. The cocreation process typically relies on the existing knowledge of the actors involved in the process. Yet, the dynamic nature of wicked problems requires actors to not just rely on cocreating on past knowledge but to cocreate tools that address future emerging or evolving problems. In this paper we seek to explain how researchers and managers can cocreate forward to address wicked problems. We illustrate the concept of cocreating forward through an innovation lab located at a Canadian business school. The lab brings together researchers, managers, and practitioners from various sectors to cocreate corporate innovation processes for addressing wicked problems. By cocreating forward, we show that research, learning, and practice need not be sequential but rather simultaneous activities.\n"
