Sometimes our systems surprise us with brittle failure—faults in a remote part of the system cascade into large scale failures. Sometimes our systems surprise us when they work at all—the entanglements sometimes support emergent behavior that acts like a safety net instead of a weakest link. Here we offer examples of tangled layered networks."
