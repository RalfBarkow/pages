The joint labor provides for a zone of proximal development, where qualitatively new forms of acting arise out of participation in some task. Participation in the relation and individual contributions to joint actions necessarily are at the person’s current developmental levels; but that participation provides for a changeover to a qualitatively new level. Importantly, whereas changes prior to the developmental change were incremental, development itself is characterized as a qualitative change, a transition between qualitatively different forms of behavior. Thus, following the changeover, subsequent incremental change will take a very different form from that which had taken place prior to the qualitative leap. It is therefore important to differentiate between cumulative, quantitative change within a form of behavior and transformative and revolutionary change that leads from a first to a second, qualitatively different form of behavior. >> changeover zone"

Although a certain level of biological development is the condition for such a change, the behavior is a typically human one and, therefore, understandable as a qualitative change in behavioral terms. For the particular case, we do not have available historical information and, therefore, do not know the extent to which Aslam already described phenomena in terms of doubling, tripling, and so on in other situations of his life. However, it is certain that he has had experiences in mathematics that deal with the relations between numbers. We may therefore assume that he already is familiar with such (mathematical) practices but, in the early part of the clinical interview, did not employ them to deal with the balance beam task. There are two aspects that have not been addressed or theoretically captured in the Piagetian literature: (a) the change in the task that the interviewer sets up and (b) the existence of a social relation, existing in and produced by the joint labor. That is, without requiring any biological maturation, we observe a relatively quick transition (occurring over the course of a few verbal exchanges) to the use of a new way of dealing with balance beam tasks. Over time, this new form also includes more complex problems that Aslam does not initially solve, initially falling back on the additive approach before seeking a way to expand ratio reasoning."

This changeover then provided a way of preparing lessons in a new way, so that, over a period of incremental changes, Leandro increasingly made his planning and implementation of lessons consistent with the new form of consciousness. In this case, the time between the emergence of a new form of consciousness and its becoming the dominant form was relative brief, occurring over the course of one (six-hour) long discussion that lasted until late into the night. If the duration of that meeting were plotted against Leandro’s entire teaching experience, it would appear to have occurred instantaneously, even though it had its own temporality. As before, there were personal and environmental characteristics involved. Both the journal article and the discussion with his fellow inquirers are environmental characteristics that are associated with the emergence and amplification of dissatisfaction Leandro experienced with his then-current form of teaching. It was after a second reading of the “Poop” article, apparently occurring during that long evening, that a feeling emerged that he had received a double slap in the face, and the simultaneously articulated rejection of his earlier teaching methods."

Although a certain level of biological development is the condition for such a change, the behavior is a typically human one and, therefore, understandable as a qualitative change in behavioral terms. For the particular case, we do not have available historical information and, therefore, do not know the extent to which Aslam already described phenomena in terms of doubling, tripling, and so on in other situations of his life. However, it is certain that he has had experiences in mathematics that deal with the relations between numbers. We may therefore assume that he already is familiar with such (mathematical) practices but, in the early part of the clinical interview, did not employ them to deal with the balance beam task.

There are two aspects that have not been addressed or theoretically captured in the Piagetian literature: (a) the change in the task that the interviewer sets up and (b) the existence of a social relation, existing in and produced by the joint labor. That is, without requiring any biological maturation, we observe a relatively quick transition (occurring over the course of a few verbal exchanges) to the use of a new way of dealing with balance beam tasks. Over time, this new form also includes more complex problems that Aslam does not initially solve, initially falling back on the additive approach before seeking a way to expand ratio reasoning."

        "text": "In the second case, Leandro, we observe a rather sudden creation of a new form of consciousness concerning teaching and the changeover to the new way of understanding his reality of teaching. This changeover then provided a way of preparing lessons in a new way, so that, over a period of incremental changes, Leandro increasingly made his planning and implementation of lessons consistent with the new form of consciousness. In this case, the time between the emergence of a new form of consciousness and its becoming the dominant form was relative brief, occurring over the course of one (six-hour) long discussion that lasted until late into the night. If the duration of that meeting were plotted against Leandro’s entire teaching experience, it would appear to have occurred instantaneously, even though it had its own temporality. As before, there were personal and environmental characteristics involved. Both the journal article and the discussion with his fellow inquirers are environmental characteristics that are associated with the emergence and amplification of dissatisfaction Leandro experienced with his then-current form of teaching. It was after a second reading of the “Poop” article, apparently occurring during that long evening, that a feeling emerged that he had received a double slap in the face, and the simultaneously articulated rejection of his earlier teaching methods."
