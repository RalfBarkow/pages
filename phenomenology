      "text": "Phenomenology (from Greek φαινόμενον, phainómenon \"that which appears\" and λόγος, lógos \"study\") is the philosophical study of the structures of experience and consciousness. As a philosophical movement it was founded in the early years of the 20th century by [[Edmund Husserl]] and was later expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany. It then spread to France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy) wikipedia]"
