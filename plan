In all differences between organic and sociocultural evolution it can be seen that this new possibility was not dependent on immediate perfection, but could build up gradually: Unnecessity of chance variation does not exclude the use of chance; the possibility to choose among the possible does not exclude the possibility to choose among the real; the reduction of the number of stabilizing systems does not require the immediate reduction to one; and socio-cultural evolution does not depend on immediate self-thematization, but can use its own progress as illustrative material in such a way that instead of evolution first system history becomes conscious. **After consolidation of the world society, however, the question will arise whether the unity of the evolving system does not make all intermediate solutions obsolete and if one wants further evolution, one must also [[plan]] it.**"
