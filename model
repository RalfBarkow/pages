        "text": "Modeling is a process everyone engages in every day. We have a model of the commuter traffic patterns on the way to work, models of the members of our family and our coworkers; in short a model of almost every significant aspect of our lives. If our models are good ones, we will be able to [[make sense]] of the world and predict, with some accuracy, how it will behave. Models come in many kinds and types, depending on the distinctions the observer wishes to make. The observer may choose a physical model, a working model, a mathematical model, a mental model, a game theoretic model or many others.\n"

        "text": "In \"Cybernetics and Management\" (Beer, 1959,) there is a helpful description of four key notions about models: \"There is a [[scaling]] down in both size and complexity – a model of Shakespeare's birthplace, for instance, could stand on a table and would not be expected to incorporate miniature timbers in equivalent numbers to the building in Stratford Upon Avon. There is a transfer across, whereby actual parts of actual things are [[represented]] again in their relative positions. And arising from this is [[workability]], by which I mean that the model can, in principle anyway, operate like the original. Thus a model train actually runs around a model railway, and it looks so much like the thing modeled that cine films of models can be substituted for film of actual trains and successfully pretend to be real. That this may be so, although the engine may be driven by clockwork introduces the fourth point. The mode is a good model if it is [[appropriate]].\"\n"
