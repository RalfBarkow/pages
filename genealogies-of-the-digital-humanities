      "text": "[…] Schreibman et al. (2004: xxvi) argue that the process of knowledge representation ‘requires humanists to make explicit what they know about their material and to understand the ways in which that material exceeds or escapes representation’, and the fact that the process digital humanists follow ‘to develop, apply and compute these knowledge representations is unlike anything that humanities scholars, outside of philosophy, have ever been required to do’."

Indeed, the digital humanities have also developed a role in engaging the public, and as Liu argues, the digital humanities are 'ideally positioned to develop, adapt, and disseminate new methods for exchange between the humanities and the public', but also to 'create technologies that fundamentally reshape the representation of the humanities' (Liu 2012: 496-7). \n"

Here we want to move beyond linear narratives of the development of the digital humanities and make connections between the digital humanities and other disciplinary formations, both historically and in terms of important influences. We also want to link these to the contemporary milieu in which the digital humanities are rapidly expanding and connecting with other fields and approaches. But first, let's take a brief look at the foundations of the digital humanities, that is, computing in the humanities.\n"
