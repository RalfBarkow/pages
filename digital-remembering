Importantly, these two levels have moved closer together because individuals actively participate in digital publics or, in some cases, allow them to emerge through their everyday communication. Hoskins (2014, 51) speaks of the \"circulation of the self\" as a prominent feature of digitization, because people can appear on the Internet, away from access-restricted mass media publics, with their memories, perspectives, and emotions, and potentially reach a global audience. \n\nIn the following, we will outline, along the analytical categories presented, what the socio-technological premises of digitization discussed in the literature are, under which remembering takes place today. Research focuses on the relationship between remembering and forgetting under conditions of digital storage and datafication (Sick 2004; Zierold 2006, 154-189; Assmann 2006; Esposito 2013; Esposito 2017), as well as networking and the affectivity of digital public communication on the Internet (van Dijck 2007; Garde-Hansen et al. 2009; Keightley and Schlesinger 2014; Hoskins 2017; Sommer 2018; Menke 2019)."

      "text": "At first glance, digitization seems to have made remembering enormously easier, because there are now only a few technical restrictions on the communication and storage of objectivations of the past. At first glance, the supposed problem of [[forget]]ting, which mankind first countered with mnemonics and then increasingly with media with storage capacities (Esposito 2016), has thus finally been solved. There is hardly any lack of storage capacity anymore. But digital remembering seems to be characterized more by the problem of forgetting than that of remembering due to the possibilities of unlimited storage, which is why its role will be examined in more detail below (see also Hoskins' essay in this volume)."

      "text": "Due to the enormous storage capacities for digital remembering, the old question of whether it is actually desirable to no longer forget has led to new discussion. In memory research, this is clearly denied and at the same time it is argued that remembering cannot be equated with storing and that furthermore the handling of memory is psychologically as well as socially dependent on forgetting (Ricœur 2004; Mayer-Schönberger 2011; Frick-Salzmann 2017) in order to select and prioritize in a meaningful way. Thus, despite technological change and digital storage and archiving possibilities, forgetting continues to be a central component of human and societal meaning-making and memory-cultural transmission (Assmann 2016). What is new is that the past is for the most part stored directly through its digital objectivation, is (more) publicly accessible, and can be retrieved and remembered again in a low-threshold way through user-friendly interfaces, instead of not being documented at all or only in archives and media that are difficult to access."

      "text": "Confronted with the volume of communication in today's societies and the indifferent storage of almost all communication on the Internet, it is therefore not surprising that debates about digital remembering have focused in particular on forgetting and its benefits. More than ever, it is true that \"[t]here is content available to society that no one thinks about, but that nevertheless is not 'forgotten'\" (Esposito 2013, 91). Aleida Assmann argued some time ago that while a machine could store, only humans could also remember (Assmann 2001, 15). It could be supplemented by saying that the machine can erase, but only humans can forget (Chun 2008). It has been shown that permanent storage becomes a problem especially when there are conflicts of interest about whether something should be accessible on the Internet in the long term and about the dangers of an Internet that can make everything stored from the past accessible at any time."

      "text": "One example is the discussion about the \"right to be forgotten\", which found its way into the EU General Data Protection Regulation in 2018 as the \"right to erasure\" and ensures the enforcement of deletions of personal data. This right stems from a judgment requiring Google to delete links to websites containing personal data under certain circumstances (Singer and Beck 2019). However, the underlying fundamental problem of forgetting under conditions of the digital engages memory research even beyond this specific legal issue (Ghezzi et al. 2014; Tirosh 2017). Another example is the Facebook Memories feature (Migowski and Fernandes Araújo 2019; Humphreys 2020), which, according to Facebook's help section, cannot be disabled but \"[d]u can specify what you see under Memories by hiding people or data you do not want to be remembered\" (Meta 2022)."

      "text": "In view of the further development of such algorithms and artificial intelligence on various platforms, it does not seem to be a central problem to prioritize the past for remembering, to select it, and to make it findable in the growing cosmos of digital lenses. Looking back at the invention of printing in the early modern era, Esposito (2016, 335) notes that new technologies have always required the development of new retrieval systems, such as indexing in libraries and archives, which, based on corresponding databases, made it possible to locate specific knowledge - and thus also the past - without having to be able to remember the contents in advance. As is the case with search engines today, it was sufficient to know, on the basis of the data on the holdings, which category or keywords had to be searched for. Datafication is therefore not new per se and can be found historically even in pre-digital times (Koenen et al. 2021). Thanks to these systems, the concern about the uncontrollability of the past on the Internet is therefore also considered by Esposito to be rather unfounded: "

        "text": "Due to the enormous storage capacities for digital remembering, the old question of whether it is actually desirable to no longer forget has led to new discussion. In memory research, this is clearly denied and at the same time it is argued that remembering cannot be equated with storing and that furthermore the handling of memory is psychologically as well as socially dependent on forgetting (Ricœur 2004; Mayer-Schönberger 2011; Frick-Salzmann 2017) in order to select and prioritize in a meaningful way. Thus, despite technological change and digital storage and archiving possibilities, forgetting continues to be a central component of human and societal meaning-making and memory-cultural transmission (Assmann 2016). What is new is that the past is for the most part stored directly through its digital objectivation, is (more) publicly accessible, and can be retrieved and remembered again in a low-threshold way through user-friendly interfaces, instead of not being documented at all or only in archives and media that are difficult to access."

        "text": "Confronted with the volume of communication in today's societies and the indifferent storage of almost all communication on the Internet, it is therefore not surprising that debates about digital remembering have focused in particular on forgetting and its benefits. More than ever, it is true that \"[t]here is content available to society that no one thinks about, but that nevertheless is not 'forgotten'\" (Esposito 2013, 91). Aleida Assmann argued some time ago that while a machine could store, only humans could also remember (Assmann 2001, 15). It could be supplemented by saying that the machine can erase, but only humans can forget (Chun 2008). It has been shown that permanent storage becomes a problem especially when there are conflicts of interest about whether something should be accessible on the Internet in the long term and about the dangers of an Internet that can make everything stored from the past accessible at any time."

This right stems from a judgment requiring Google to delete links to websites containing personal data under certain circumstances (Singer and Beck 2019). However, the underlying fundamental problem of forgetting under conditions of the digital engages memory research even beyond this specific legal issue (Ghezzi et al. 2014; Tirosh 2017). Another example is the Facebook Memories feature (Migowski and Fernandes Araújo 2019; Humphreys 2020), which, according to Facebook's help section, cannot be disabled but \"[d]u can specify what you see under Memories by hiding people or data you do not want to be remembered\" (Meta 2022)."
