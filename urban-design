A smart guy, [[Paul Murrain]], suggested a progression in development with respect to risk: First the risk oblivious start something, then the risk aware improve it, finally the risk adverse block any further innovation. Oblivious ⇒ aware ⇒ adverse. An interesting progression, not unlike Wardley's horizontal axis."
