The history of learning is built in. The potential for others to transparently share and enhance opinions, evidence and suggestions is built in. Even the potential to visualize the current aggregated assessments while allowing drill down seems possible. One limitation/value is the requirement for transparency. In neighborhoods this sees a net positive."
