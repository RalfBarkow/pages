It is mainly written for students aged about 14-19 years, some parts for younger students. Most of the website uses Python as the teaching language. For OOP, I have created a chapter using Java with BlueJ/Greenfoot. There is also a chapter about functional programming with Python. However, we believe it would be much better to use a language that encourages functional thinking.\n\nThe website is developed using Kirby CMS (https://getkirby.com/ 2), which I am not very familiar with, as I am not involved in the technical aspects of the site. As an author, I write HTML code as static files. Almost every page on inf-schule corresponds to a single HTML file. Kirby creates the menu, generates permalinks, and so on.\n\nBecause of that, I am restricted in how I can use JavaScript. For example, I cannot include JS libraries in the head of the HTML file. Additionally, I am not very experienced in developing JS. I never liked JS very much, and it is not a programming language I would choose to teach. Choosing Elm as the programming language to teach FP has the side effect (who said FP doesn’t allow side effects :slight_smile: ) that I learn a language that I really like and that I can use to write small apps for inf-schule without having to improve my JS knowledge. The REPL plugin seems to depend on GitBook, so it appears to me that I cannot use it right away. If I had a JS file that one could include in any static webpage, it should also work for inf-schule.\n\nRegarding the question “Where do you want to execute the Elm code?”: I thought the REPL runs completely in the browser. Does it connect to any server to execute the code? [https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/include-online-repl/9027/5 discourse]"

Available from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3Xack9ufYkAn interactive diagram can be an effective way to communicate a mental model, because it can convey a way of seeing a problem or system. Currently, to create an interactive diagram one must write code to procedurally draw the diagram and respond appropriately to user input. Writing this code can take hours or days. Apparatus aims to reduce the time to create an interactive diagram from hours to minutes.\n\nApparatus combines the direct manipulation capabilities of a vector graphics editor with the dataflow capabilities of a spreadsheet. Through this hybridization, Apparatus supports both spatial and symbolic ways of working in tandem. Dataflow defines the state space of a diagram, algebra driving geometry. Dragging shapes moves through this state space, geometry driving algebra. Instead of function calls or object-oriented inheritance, Apparatus uses a “call by copying” pattern for diagram reuse. Reused diagrams do not need to be explicitly parameterized. Instead of loops, Apparatus uses spreads which allow any value to exist in a “superposition”. This allows shapes to be looped over implicitly. By decomposing shapes into paths of points, it also enables Apparatus to plot curves."

        "text": "An interactive diagram can be an effective way to communicate a mental model, because it can convey a way of seeing a problem or system. Currently, to create an interactive diagram one must write code to procedurally draw the diagram and respond appropriately to user input. Writing this code can take hours or days. Apparatus aims to reduce the time to create an interactive diagram from hours to minutes.\n\nApparatus combines the direct manipulation capabilities of a vector graphics editor with the dataflow capabilities of a spreadsheet. Through this hybridization, Apparatus supports both spatial and symbolic ways of working in tandem. Dataflow defines the state space of a diagram, [[Algebra Driving Geometry]]. Dragging shapes moves through this state space, geometry driving algebra. Instead of function calls or object-oriented inheritance, Apparatus uses a “call by copying” pattern for diagram reuse. Reused diagrams do not need to be explicitly parameterized. Instead of loops, Apparatus uses spreads which allow any value to exist in a “superposition”. This allows shapes to be looped over implicitly. By decomposing shapes into paths of points, it also enables Apparatus to plot curves."

We articulate a vision for computer programming that includes pen-based computing, a paradigm we term notational programming. Notational programming blurs contexts: certain typewritten variables can be referenced in handwritten notation and vice-versa. To illustrate this paradigm, we developed an extension, Notate, to computational notebooks which allows users to open drawing canvases within lines of code. As a case study, we explore quantum programming and designed a notation, Qaw, that extends quantum circuit notation with abstraction features, such as variable-sized wire bundles and recursion. Results from a usability study with novices suggest that users find our core interaction of implicit cross-context references intuitive, but suggests further improvements to debugging infrastructure, interface design, and recognition rates. Throughout, we discuss questions raised by the notational paradigm, including a shift from ‘recognition’ of notations to ‘reconfiguration’ of practices and values around programming, and from ‘sketching’ to writing and drawing, or what we call ‘notating.’\n"

We articulate a vision for computer programming that includes pen-based computing, a paradigm we term notational programming. Notational programming blurs contexts: certain typewritten variables can be referenced in handwritten notation and vice-versa. To illustrate this paradigm, we developed an extension, Notate, to computational notebooks which allows users to open drawing canvases within lines of code. As a case study, we explore quantum programming and designed a notation, Qaw, that extends quantum circuit notation with abstraction features, such as variable-sized wire bundles and recursion. Results from a usability study with novices suggest that users find our core interaction of implicit cross-context references intuitive, but suggests further improvements to debugging infrastructure, interface design, and recognition rates. Throughout, we discuss questions raised by the notational paradigm, including a shift from ‘recognition’ of notations to ‘reconfiguration’ of practices and values around programming, and from ‘sketching’ to writing and drawing, or what we call ‘notating.’\n"

It is mainly written for students aged about 14-19 years, some parts for younger students. Most of the website uses Python as the teaching language. For OOP, I have created a chapter using Java with BlueJ/Greenfoot. There is also a chapter about functional programming with Python. However, we believe it would be much better to use a language that encourages functional thinking.\n\nThe website is developed using Kirby CMS (https://getkirby.com/ 2), which I am not very familiar with, as I am not involved in the technical aspects of the site. As an author, I write HTML code as static files. Almost every page on inf-schule corresponds to a single HTML file. Kirby creates the menu, generates permalinks, and so on.\n\nBecause of that, I am restricted in how I can use JavaScript. For example, I cannot include JS libraries in the head of the HTML file. Additionally, I am not very experienced in developing JS. I never liked JS very much, and it is not a programming language I would choose to teach. Choosing Elm as the programming language to teach FP has the side effect (who said FP doesn’t allow side effects :slight_smile: ) that I learn a language that I really like and that I can use to write small apps for inf-schule without having to improve my JS knowledge. The REPL plugin seems to depend on GitBook, so it appears to me that I cannot use it right away. If I had a JS file that one could include in any static webpage, it should also work for inf-schule.\n\nRegarding the question “Where do you want to execute the Elm code?”: I thought the REPL runs completely in the browser. Does it connect to any server to execute the code?"
