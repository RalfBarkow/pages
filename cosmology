It has troubled scientists, philosophers, and theologians for at least two and a half thousand years. There might not be much for us to learn from the most ancient works, but some of the more general ideas have validity today. Take the Epicureans for example; they meant that the order we see around us today was once in early history complete chaos. This idea can very well be compared to the turbulence theory, which will be presented below. Aristotle, on the contrary, believed that order could not be created from disorder. Newton supported this idea by arguing against the vortex cosmogony of Descartes, on the ground that it would fail to reproduce the cosmic order displayed by Kepler's laws. These ideas are similar to the gravitational instability theory, which states that entropy increases with time. "
