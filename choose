        "text": "(2) Also socio-cultural evolution remains dependent on selection, thus must be able to presuppose a \"what from\" of selection. But its selection mechanism *can [[choose]] not only among the real, but also among the possible*. It does not presuppose that the selection field already exists, i.e. is already created by mutative variation and is then destroyed again or exceptionally preserved; but it presents in the form of sense at the same time a field of possible subsequent selections, i.e. real possibilities, among which one can choose without having to realize first everything that can be chosen. This avoids unnecessary production detours. At the same time, a considerable acceleration is achieved. The further course as well as the speed of socio-cultural evolution are therefore essentially determined by what real possibilities are at disposal (according to what we had explained above in chapter 1.5 about increasing the complexity of the possible).\n"
