        "text": "Another question is should our education systems be about chasing jobs? Getting a 'good job' has been the desired endgame of an education for decades. Our students were encouraged to work hard, get good grades,and go to university. This was to result in being rewarded by a career with a reputable firm, with good conditions and financial security. This has been the dominant proposition for a very long time."

        "text": "My Dad passed away recently. He slowly declined over years with the cruel theft Parkinson's Disease inflicts on the body. It was a devastating decline for a sportsman and journalist. In life Dad was a gentleman and a gentle man and to a large extent risk adverse. I felt his dreams were not realised and aspirations not met. I wonder what his contribution might have been."

In fact, in relation to not pursuing a number of options, including architecture, when I wore a younger man's clothes. I have attempted to 'prove' myself through career promotions and collecting qualifications. What was below the surface until recently was a nagging feeling of self doubt and unmet potential. I do feel that my small dent in the universe is happening now."
