      "text": "In the paradigm of [[Stochastic Computing]], arithmetic functions are computed on randomized bit streams. The method naturally and effectively tolerates very high clock skew. Exploiting this advantage, this paper introduces polysynchronous clocking, a design strategy in which clock domains are split at a very fine level. Each domain is synchronized by an inexpensive local clock. Alternatively, the skew requirements for a global clock distribution network can be relaxed. This allows for a higher working frequency and so lower latency. The benefits of both approaches are quantified. Polysynchronous clocking results in significant latency, area, and energy savings for wide variety of applications."
