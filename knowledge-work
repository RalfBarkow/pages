Additionally, instead of integrated systems for workplace learning or knowledge management that support a prescribed, comprehensive process of handling knowledge and learning in organisations in their entirety, we focus on loosely coupled arrangements of services supporting selected activities which are well aligned with the context of the work environment, i.e. the “spirit” [10], of the digital artefacts and tools available in the work environment and adopted by a community of knowledge workers that are jointly engaged in knowledge handling activities in an organisation. In this paper, so-called knowledge maturing activities (KM activities) are defined.

We employ a broad empirical study involving 126 European organisations. Collected data is analysed with a mixedmethod approach using quantitative and qualitative methods.
