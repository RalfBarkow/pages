Informal organization was mainly understood in terms of group psychology, i.e., as the spontaneous self-development of groups. This corresponded to widespread research interests in social psychology at that time. Furthermore, groups as bearers of informal organization had been observed and researched from the management's point of view. This brought into play another distinction that was only meaningful from this perspective, namely that of underperformance and overperformance. On the one hand, groups had to be expected to slow down performance to a level acceptable to them and to cooperate in covering up poor performance or mistakes; but on the other hand, given a good group climate, it was also possible to think in terms of additional performance, which could not have been ordered. Thus, one could hope and expect from the side of the researchers that the knowledge of the mechanisms of informal organization could be of help to the management in understanding the processes in the company and in the daily business of the management. Finally, since the famous Hawthorne experiments, the relevant research had taken place mainly in organizations of industrial production. There, groups were easy to discover because of the formal organization of work and their spatial (machine-related) coherence. But this also spared the question whether the extent to which formal organization leads to the formation of informal groups does not vary from type of organization to type of organization, so that the findings on informal organization can only be generalized to a very limited extent. During many years of work in public administration, [[Niklas Luhmann]] had encountered [[Coalition]]s and [[Network]]s of various kinds, but not groups in a sense that could be delimited on the basis of their self-understanding."

Roughly speaking, it offered the possibility of tracing the difference between formal and informal organization back to the differentiation of a social system \"organization\"; for one could imagine that the difference thus created imposed problems on the differentiated system which could not be solved by the means of formal organization alone, i.e. not by a departmental division and a hierarchy which concentrated external contacts (or at least: their regulation) at the top of the system if possible. Above all, the concrete work motivation of the members, but also the inconspicuous and relatively smooth solution of the problems, which today [[Transaction Cost Analysis]] discusses, can hardly be sufficiently guaranteed by formal regulations.

Everything else, buildings, machines, but also the people themselves and all that non-members negotiate among themselves, belongs to the environment of the system. Moreover, it is clear that membership is assumed by decisions and terminated by decisions. Thus, it is decisions by which the organization generates itself and demarcates itself from its environment in ongoing communication. Finally, the notion of role was meant to express that while roles establish membership in the organization and certain general expectations, the violation of which will lead to loss of membership in the long run, this still leaves much room for maneuver that can be filled by both formal and informal communication."

Although the relationship between cybernetics and self-reference had already been lively discussed in the large Macy conferences of the 1950s, and although \"self-organization\" was an established topic around 1960, the export of systems theory to disciplines outside the core group was still based on relatively simple models – above all the stabilization model of negative feedback or homeostasis and the input/output model, which treated the transformation of inputs into outputs as a matter of a simple mathematical calculus or an appropriately constructed machine. The fact that this could not work for mathematical reasons as soon as outputs were reintroduced into the system as inputs, i.e. reflexive loops were formed, only became known later in wider circles."

On the part of systems theory, there was at first only an attempt to provide within this theory for soothing distinctions, such as that of artificial and natural or that of mechanical and organic models, but the counter-models remained unclear and functioned only as placeholders for a complexity that could not yet be scientifically grasped. On these bases, the controversy could only be fought out ideologically, and eventually, after both sides had made their scent marks, lost its intellectual appeal. But this without the newer approaches to a theory of self-referential systems having been considered, let alone tried out as a theory of organization."

In this sense, systems theory established the system/environment distinction as the guiding concept of organizational sociology. At first, the environment was treated as a turbulent, overly complex external world on which the organization was dependent, be it in its information, be it in its resources. The information/resource distinction, in turn, led to a bifurcation that brought into view either problems of uncertainty or problems of power in the sense of resource control. "

So now the distinction system environment / society came into view, and contingency theory was supplemented by institutional theory, if not displaced from the prominent places of theory development. This corresponded to a conviction, spreading especially in business enterprises, that a company could not legitimize itself socially solely through its product, but that social factors and, most recently, ecological consequential problems of its production processes also played a role. For public administration, this corresponds to the insight that successful activity, especially in view of the expansion of tasks in the wake of the welfare state, cannot be legally enforced in many cases, but is dependent on the cooperation of those concerned.

Today, however, this is no longer done only by means of the distinction between environment and society with its correlate concepts of institution and culture. Recently, it has also been done by the so-called network analyses. Here the system / environment distinction is supplemented or, as the protagonists think, replaced by a plethora of system-to-system distinctions. It can be clearly seen that here further arguments against the classical model of hierarchical-centralized management are being raised. In the network, non-centralized information accrues, because here effects of changes can and must be assessed – effects on trust, limits of reasonableness, resilience, surviving gains and losses in a relationship; and in the realm of state and community organizations, for example: consequences of political changes. Above all, it seems to be accelerations and increases in the impact of structural changes that draw attention to this phenomenon. After all, there have always been weighty customer and supplier dependencies or dependencies on public financial sources or on political conspicuousness / inconspicuousness. The new topics of observation do not go beyond the framework of systems theory; and especially when central planning becomes more difficult, one must at least be able to determine whether one has to reckon with internal or external conditions and proceed accordingly in the organization or as in the market."

It lives from its opposition to the classical doctrine of optimal rationality, which for its part was based on the distinction between ends and means. The big names here are James March and Karl Weick. At the time of the publication of Functions and Consequences of Formal Organization, the trend was already visible, but had not attracted interest either in business administration (the exception being Horst AIbach) or in the sociology of organization. Herbert A. Simon had emphasized the limits of the information processing possibilities demanded by the principle of optimization, and had changed the theory of rational decision from an orientation towards the sole deciding entrepreneur to a theory of decisions of elaborating organizations. Following Simon, one already spoke of \"bounded rationality\". A two-stage model had been introduced, which worked with the assumption of decisions about decision premises. "

With this summary, it was possible to integrate systems theory, decision theory, and the theory of formal and informal organizations. A very consequential and successful book by Cyert and March on a behavioral theory of organizations had just been published. Nevertheless, the scope of this movement could not yet be estimated. Their concern was and is, as can be seen today, not only a critique of exaggerated rationality claims – as if management had to be brought back to the ground of empirical reality. Right down to the style of language, it is about the astonishment that it also works without rationality – and how it works."

Scientific discoveries become unilaterally flagged, for example, as informal organization or not-so-rational decision-making. Reconstructing distinctions neutralizes, in a sense, the joys of discovery and the punctuations at which discontinuities make themselves felt. One must abandon the hope of telling the history of science according to the \"A causes B\" causal model. Rather, it is a history of continuous discontinuity, a history of \"reaction to ...,\" a self-motivating history. But if one wants to tell history not as a history of facts, but as a history of observations, it must be noted that any designation of something thereby determined requires the distinction from something else - first, of course, the distinction from \"everything else,\" especially in the history of science, but also the distinction from the hitherto usual."

It then becomes more and more difficult to imagine how a comprehensive theory is still possible. Perhaps in much higher degrees of abstraction. Perhaps only in the ecumenical conciliation of a \"postmodern\" discourse.

As far as the world is concerned, we may share the philosophers' resignation. But organizations are, after all, a well-contourable, well-defined set of facts. The book reissued here had attempted such an integration at the state of knowledge at that time. With this ambition of bringing together systems theory and decision theory and with the attempt to get from there both the informal sides within the systems and the deviations from ideas of rational decision making into view, the book has, as far as he can see, found no successor. This may account for its continued relevance and justify the new edition, for which the publisher is to be thanked. If one wanted to undertake a similar project at the present state of research, one would not only have to include the transdisciplinary efforts to develop a general theory of self-referential, \"autopoietic\" systems, but, in connection with this, one would also have to dissolve and recompose the concept of decision. It is difficult to estimate how one can get from there back to descriptions of the realities of everyday work in organizations that are relatively close to the milieu and recognizable for \"members\"."

On these bases, the controversy could only be fought out ideologically, and eventually, after both sides had made their scent marks, lost its intellectual appeal.

So now the distinction system environment/society came into view, and contingency theory was supplemented by institutional theory, if not displaced from the prominent places of theory development. This corresponded to a conviction, spreading especially in business enterprises, that a company could not legitimize itself socially solely through its product, but that social factors and, most recently, ecological consequential problems of its production processes also played a role. For public administration, this corresponds to the insight that successful activity, especially in view of the expansion of tasks in the wake of the welfare state, cannot be legally enforced in many cases, but is dependent on the cooperation of those concerned. Of course, the old concept of institution can reflect this only very inadequately; but it at least responds to expanded conditions of acceptance of organizations in the society surrounding them. In these distinctions linked to distinctions, the insight gains of the old distinction of formal and informal organizations get out of sight without having been refuted or even devalued in any way. It is just that the spotlights of current interest tend to illuminate other areas, more the external relations of organizations. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)"

For public administration, this corresponds to the insight that successful activity, especially in view of the expansion of tasks in the wake of the welfare state, cannot be legally enforced in many cases, but is dependent on the cooperation of those concerned. Of course, the old concept of institution can reflect this only very inadequately; but it at least responds to expanded conditions of acceptance of organizations in the society surrounding them. In these distinctions linked to distinctions, the insight gains of the old distinction of formal and informal organizations get out of sight without having been refuted or even devalued in any way.

        "text": "In contrast, the view has become established, also and especially in organizational research, that systems cannot be regarded as artificial or natural wholes, but that the difference between system and environment must be assumed. In this sense, systems theory established the system/environment distinction as the guiding concept of organizational sociology. At first, the environment was treated as a turbulent, overly complex external world on which the organization was dependent, be it in its information, be it in its resources. The information/resource distinction, in turn, led to a bifurcation that brought into view either problems of uncertainty or problems of power in the sense of resource control. This so-called contingency theory was in turn criticized at the end of the 1970s with the accusation that it saw the environment of organizations as too unstructured, whereas in reality it was always a question of society, which had accepted certain cultural patterns and values and had thus always already limited its own complexity. So now the distinction system environment/society came into view, and contingency theory was supplemented by institutional theory, if not displaced from the prominent places of theory development.

        "text": "In contrast, the view has become established, also and especially in organizational research, that systems cannot be regarded as artificial or natural wholes, but that the difference between system and environment must be assumed. In this sense, systems theory established the system/environment distinction as the guiding concept of organizational sociology. At first, the environment was treated as a turbulent, overly complex external world on which the organization was dependent, be it in its information, be it in its resources. The information/resource distinction, in turn, led to a bifurcation that brought into view either problems of uncertainty or problems of power in the sense of resource control. "

So now the distinction system environment/society came into view, and contingency theory was supplemented by institutional theory, if not displaced from the prominent places of theory development.

        "text": "One must therefore describe \"the environment\" of the organization more precisely than the older contingency theory had done. Today, however, this is no longer done only by means of the distinction between environment and society with its correlate concepts of institution and culture. Recently, it has also been done by the so-called network analyses. Here the system / environment distinction is supplemented or, as the protagonists think, replaced by a plethora of system-to-system distinctions. It can be clearly seen that here further arguments against the classical model of hierarchical-centralized management are being raised. In the network, non-centralized information accrues, because here effects of changes can and must be assessed – effects on trust, limits of reasonableness, resilience, surviving gains and losses in a relationship; and in the realm of state and community organizations, for example: consequences of political changes. Above all, it seems to be accelerations and increases in the impact of structural changes that draw attention to this phenomenon. After all, there have always been weighty customer and supplier dependencies or dependencies on public financial sources or on political conspicuousness / inconspicuousness. The new topics of observation do not go beyond the framework of systems theory; and especially when central planning becomes more difficult, one must at least be able to determine whether one has to reckon with internal or external conditions and proceed accordingly in the organization or as in the market."

Roughly speaking, it offered the possibility of tracing the difference between formal and informal organization back to the differentiation of a social system \"organization\"; for one could imagine that the difference thus created imposed problems on the differentiated system which could not be solved by the means of formal organization alone, i.e. not by a departmental division and a hierarchy which concentrated external contacts (or at least: their regulation) at the top of the system if possible. Above all, the concrete work motivation of the members, but also the inconspicuous and relatively smooth solution of the problems, which today [[Transaction Cost Analysis]] discusses, can hardly be sufficiently guaranteed by formal regulations.

Even if one disregards the ongoing change of self-recommendation fashions in the management consulting literature, organizational science today is not the same as it was in 1964. But this need not mean that certain research perspectives have been refuted or otherwise rendered obsolete. For the most part, sciences do not develop according to the scientific-theoretical model of asserting, testing, and accepting or rejecting hypotheses. This would result in no history at all, but only a waste mountain of discarded attempts at knowledge. Rather, it seems to be the case that one works for a while with certain distinctions in order to work out what can be made visible with them, and when this begins to bore after some time, one moves on to other distinctions."

But if this is so: which distinctions were and are important for [[ Funktionen und Folgen formaler Organisation]] (Functions and Consequences of Formal Organization), which distinction policy was the leitmotif then, and what has changed since then?"

        "text": "The American discussion, to which one could look back at the beginning of the 1960s, had enriched the schema formal / informal organization with certain added options, but also burdened it. Informal organization was mainly understood in terms of group psychology, i.e., as the spontaneous self-development of groups. This corresponded to widespread research interests in social psychology at that time. Furthermore, groups as bearers of informal organization had been observed and researched from the management's point of view. This brought into play another distinction that was only meaningful from this perspective, namely that of underperformance and overperformance. On the one hand, groups had to be expected to slow down performance to a level acceptable to them and to cooperate in covering up poor performance or mistakes; but on the other hand, given a good group climate, it was also possible to think in terms of additional performance, which could not have been ordered. Thus, one could hope and expect from the side of the researchers that the knowledge of the mechanisms of informal organization could be of help to the management in understanding the processes in the company and in the daily business of the management. Finally, since the famous Hawthorne experiments, the relevant research had taken place mainly in organizations of industrial production. There, groups were easy to discover because of the formal organization of work and their spatial (machine-related) coherence. But this also spared the question whether the extent to which formal organization leads to the formation of informal groups does not vary from type of organization to type of organization, so that the findings on informal organization can only be generalized to a very limited extent. During many years of work in public administration, [[Niklas Luhmann]] had encountered [[Coalition]]s and [[Network]]s of various kinds, but not groups in a sense that could be delimited on the basis of their self-understanding."
