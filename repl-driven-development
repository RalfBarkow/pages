REPL-driven development, however, is not so much a strict set of practices and guidelines for development as it is a recognition that the REPL is a useful tool to leverage regardless of your development process. Even if you are already following a methodology like test-driven development, leveraging the REPL to speed your feedback leads to more productivity. This section covers the basics of working with the REPL in a Clojure project as well as how you can integrate a REPL with some tools you may already be familiar with."
