      "text": "If a particle occupies one node (i.e., it is contracted ), it can expand to an unoccupied adjacent node to occupy two nodes. If a particle occupies two nodes (i.e., it is expanded ), it can contract to one of these nodes to occupy only a single node. Performing movements via expansions and contractions has various advantages. For example, it would easily allow a particle to abort a movement if its movement is in conflict with other movements. A particle always knows whether it is contracted or expanded and this information will be available to neighboring particles. For an expanded particle, we denote the node the particle last expanded into as the head of the particle and call the other occupied node its tail. In a handover, two scenarios are possible: a) a contracted particle p can ”[[push]]” a neighboring expanded particle q and expand into the neighboring node previously occupied by q, forcing q to contract, or b) an expanded particle p can ”[[pull]]” a neighboring contracted particle q to a cell occupied by it thereby expanding that particle to that cell, which allows p to contract to its other cell. The ability to use a handover allows the system to stay connected while particles move (e.g., for particles moving in a worm-like fashion). Note that while expansions and contractions may represent the way particles physically move in space, they can also be interpreted as a particle ”looking ahead” and establishing new logical connections (by expanding) before it fully moves to a new position and severs the old connections it had (by contracting)."
