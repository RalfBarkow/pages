Its victims, however, will undoubtedly see it differently. And it is doubtful whether a left perspective is at all possible without regard to people living now. In any case, it is no good for analyzing current crises. This has been shown by the blatant miscalculations of all those who considered Putin's frequently proclaimed ethnic imperialism to be mere claptrap and, in their fixation on power blocs, were not the least bit interested in what was bothering the people in Ukraine. One could well have known - in the self-image of an \"expert\" one should even have known - that Putin's plans were not marked by the cool rationality that can be deciphered on the basis of geostrategic advantages and disadvantages. And if one had studied Ukraine in advance, read at least a few Ukrainian authors, such as Yuri Andrukhovych, Yevgenia Belorusets or Serhij Zhadan, one would hardly have succumbed to the ignorant illusion that the country could be regarded as a mere bargaining chip. Ukraine is not the post-Soviet terra incognita controlled by Nazi Nato henchmen that many on the left here have seen it as since the days of the Euromaidan. It is a country full of fractures and contradictions, but since the so-called Orange Revolution in 2004, a steadily growing majority of its society has been striving toward \"Western values. Anyone who has followed this development in recent years knows that it was not \"NATO aggression\" that provoked Putin's invasion, but the realization that this country, which he claims as part of the historic Russian empire, is continuing to lose to \"the West\" day by day, even without NATO or EU membership."

What currently appears as Putinism is therefore in truth only a changing camouflage for left-wing reactionary cynicism."

Ihre Opfer indes werden das zweifellos anders sehen. Und ob eine linke Perspektive ohne Rücksicht auf jetzt lebende Menschen überhaupt möglich ist, darf bezweifelt werden. Zur Analyse aktueller Krisen taugt sie jedenfalls nicht. Das haben die eklatanten Fehlprognosen all jener gezeigt, die ­Putins vielfach bekundeten völkischen Imperialismus für bloßes Gedöns ­hielten und sich in ihrer Fixierung auf Machtblöcke keinen Deut dafür interessierten, was die Menschen in der Ukraine umtreibt. Man hätte durchaus wissen können – im Selbstverständnis eines »Experten« sogar wissen müssen –, dass Putins Pläne nicht von jener kühlen Ra­tionalität gezeichnet waren, die man anhand geostra­tegischer Vor- und Nachteile entschlüsseln kann. Und hätte man sich vorab mal mit der Ukraine befasst, wenigstens ein paar ukrainische Autoren gelesen, Jurij Andruchowytsch etwa, Yevgenia Belorusets oder Serhij Zhadan, man wäre kaum der ignoranten Illusion erlegen, das Land als bloße Verhandlungsmasse betrachten zu können. Die Ukraine ist nicht die von nazistischen Nato-Freischärlern kontrollierte postsowjetische terra incognita, als die sie viele hiesige Linke seit den Tagen des Euromaidan ansehen. Sie ist ein Land voller Brüche und Widersprüche, dessen Gesellschaft jedoch seit der sogenannten Orangenen Revolution 2004 in stetig wachsender Mehrheit »west­lichen Werten« zustrebt. Wer diese Entwicklung in den vergangenen Jahren verfolgt hat, weiß, dass es keine »Nato-Aggression« war, die Putins Einmarsch provozierte, sondern die Erkenntnis, dieses von ihm als Teil des historischen russischen Imperiums beanspruchte Land auch ohne Nato- oder EU-Mitgliedschaft Tag für Tag weiter an »den Westen« zu verlieren."

What currently appears as Putinism is therefore in truth only a changing camouflage for left-wing reactionary cynicism."

        "text": "As a (post-)Marxist apocalyptic who is quite comfortable in the hated West and who expects the final crisis of capitalism over a good red wine, one probably understands the impending barbarism as a necessary phase on the way to a free society. Its victims, however, will undoubtedly see it differently. And it is doubtful whether a left perspective is at all possible without regard to people living now. In any case, it is no good for analyzing current crises. This has been shown by the blatant miscalculations of all those who considered Putin's frequently proclaimed ethnic imperialism to be mere claptrap and, in their fixation on power blocs, were not the least bit interested in what was bothering the people in Ukraine. One could well have known - in the self-image of an \"expert\" one should even have known - that Putin's plans were not marked by the cool rationality that can be deciphered on the basis of geostrategic advantages and disadvantages. And if one had studied Ukraine in advance, read at least a few Ukrainian authors, such as Yuri Andrukhovych, Yevgenia Belorusets or Serhij Zhadan, one would hardly have succumbed to the ignorant illusion that the country could be regarded as a mere bargaining chip. Ukraine is not the post-Soviet terra incognita controlled by Nazi Nato henchmen that many on the left here have seen it as since the days of the Euromaidan. It is a country full of fractures and contradictions, but since the so-called Orange Revolution in 2004, a steadily growing majority of its society has been striving toward \"Western values. Anyone who has followed this development in recent years knows that it was not \"NATO aggression\" that provoked Putin's invasion, but the realization that this country, which he claims as part of the historic Russian empire, is continuing to lose to \"the West\" day by day, even without NATO or EU membership."
