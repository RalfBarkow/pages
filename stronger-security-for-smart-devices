      "text": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers demonstrated two security techniques that block power and electromagnetic side-channel attacks targeting analog-to-digital (ADC) converters in smart devices. The countermeasures involve adding randomization to ADC conversion, which in one case uses a random number generator to decide when each capacitor switches, complicating the correlation of power supplies with output data. That method also keeps the comparator in constant operation, preventing hackers from ascertaining when each conversion stage begins and ends. The second technique employs two comparators and an algorithm to randomly establish two thresholds rather than one, creating millions of ways 76an ADC could reach a digital output."
