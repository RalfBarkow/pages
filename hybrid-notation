And of course we can conveniently move back and forth between a name and the form that the name identifies. We can also engage in symbolic abbreviations for both typographical and reading convenience. We’ll sometimes use natural numbers, for example, to stand in place of ensembles of units. It will be convenient to use the special symbol “5”, for example, to stand in place of the form ooooo. Sometimes however it is conceptually important to show these ensembles explicitly."
