The term \"guided tour\" has come into use, following the terminology used in NoteCards. […] \"Guided tours\" are mainly useful for supporting unattended users, preferably in learning environments, but also generally for orientation in complex hypertext bases. Also with \"guided tours\" the users of the system, as with all paths, are led through relevant, coherent parts of the hypertext base. According to Zellweger (1989), the special art of building guided tours is to write instructions (in the case of NoteCards in the form of scripts) that do not define deterministic paths, as in techniques of programmed instruction, but ones in which the sequences of links remain non-linear. Furthermore, it should be possible to leave the guided tours at any point. In the following, we will take a closer look at the concept of the \"guided tour\" realized in NoteCards as presented by Marshall/Irish (1989)."

However, the advantage of this orientation may have to be bought at the price of system dominance (danger of overload). Metainformation corresponds in some respects to the cohesive functions mentioned in sections 1.1 and 1.3; it establishes syntactic and semantic coherence between map units, which tend to be atomized. In syntactic terms, sequences are regulated or suggested; in semantic-argumentative terms, the individual units are placed in larger contexts of meaning. The meta-information in \"guided tours\" is an example of how context and coherence can be reconstructed in contextless environments. The possibilities offered are e.g. (graphical or tabular) tour overviews, reading instructions \"look down\", \"look up\") or short indicative overviews of what the next stop can bring. In NoteCards, arrow metaphors are mainly used to achieve referencing between different map types, e.g. between text and graphics, between meta-information and (actual) information, or between the same map types (also from meta-information to meta-information). Examples for the use of arrows can be found in Figure 2.3.4-9 and 10."

In Figures 2.3.4-9 and 10, the technique of \"persistent cards\" is used on the one hand, and the technique of \"persistent gestures\" on the other. In the first case, the thematic continuity in the sequence of a \"guided tour\" should be indicated by identical (or largely identical) screen design. Thus, the structure of Fig. 5 (Fig. 2.3.4-9), where the general definition of \"dangerous felony\" is given, is preserved in Fig. 6 (2.3.4-10), since in both the main theme remains constant and only one concrete example is given. \"Persistent gestures\" are used as stylistic devices and structuring aids in these two sections as well. The positive and negative arguments are separated by the cards marked with \"grey arc\". In Fig. 6 (2.3.4-10) it becomes clear that the majority of the arguments are concentrated on the left side."

They are in fact largely formal and surface-oriented, i.e., they do not provide any interpretation of the contents, and, moreover, they have to be created intellectually by the authors of the hypertext base. Thus, they are largely predetermined. However, as we have seen, it is extremely difficult to keep coherence and context stable in hypertext in general, since access to hypertext is systematically interactive and it is ultimately up to the user to decide which (even of the offered) direction(s) to take or how many windows or maps in NoteCards to keep open in parallel. The attempt to make structures and decision situations transparent by means of a multitude of meta-information cannot yet be assessed in terms of its acceptance or its confirmation, since there is still too little \"reading\" experience with these means. It is therefore not yet possible to make any reliable statements about the extent to which users are willing and able to follow paths or \"guided tours\" that require a high degree of control and guidance aids. However, it is already clear that this approach used by NoteCards requires careful and elaborate \"screen management\" based on ergonomic design techniques."

The term \"guided tour\" has come into use, following the terminology used in NoteCards. In the following presentation, we will use the English term in this case. \"Guided tours\" are mainly useful for supporting unattended users, preferably in learning environments, but also generally for orientation in complex hypertext bases. Also with \"guided tours\" the users of the system, as with all paths, are led through relevant, coherent parts of the hypertext base. According to Zellweger (1989), the special art of building guided tours is to write instructions (in the case of NoteCards in the form of scripts) that do not define deterministic paths, as in techniques of programmed instruction, but ones in which the sequences of links remain non-linear. Furthermore, it should be possible to leave the guided tours at any point. In the following, we will take a closer look at the concept of the \"guided tour\" realized in NoteCards as presented by Marshall/Irish (1989)."

However, the advantage of this orientation may have to be bought at the price of system dominance (danger of overload). Metainformation corresponds in some respects to the cohesive functions mentioned in sections 1.1 and 1.3; it establishes syntactic and semantic coherence between map units, which tend to be atomized.

In Figures 2.3.4-9 and 10, the technique of \"persistent cards\" is used on the one hand, and the technique of \"persistent gestures\" on the other. In the first case, the thematic continuity in the sequence of a \"guided tour\" should be indicated by identical (or largely identical) screen design. Thus, the structure of Fig. 5 (Fig. 2.3.4-9), where the general definition of \"dangerous felony\" is given, is preserved in Fig. 6 (2.3.4-10), since in both the main theme remains constant and only one concrete example is given. \"Persistent gestures\" are used as stylistic devices and structuring aids in these two sections as well. The positive and negative arguments are separated by the cards marked with \"grey arc\". In Fig. 6 (2.3.4-10) it becomes clear that the majority of the arguments are concentrated on the left side."

They are in fact largely formal and surface-oriented, i.e., they do not provide any interpretation of the contents, and, moreover, they have to be created intellectually by the authors of the hypertext base. Thus, they are largely predetermined. However, as we have seen, it is extremely difficult to keep coherence and context stable in hypertext in general, since access to hypertext is systematically interactive and it is ultimately up to the user to decide which (even of the offered) direction(s) to take or how many windows or maps in NoteCards to keep open in parallel. The attempt to make structures and decision situations transparent by means of a multitude of meta-information cannot yet be assessed in terms of its acceptance or its confirmation, since there is still too little \"reading\" experience with these means. It is therefore not yet possible to make any reliable statements about the extent to which users are willing and able to follow paths or \"guided tours\" that require a high degree of control and guidance aids. However, it is already clear that this approach used by NoteCards requires careful and elaborate \"screen management\" based on ergonomic design techniques."

        "text": "Of the many pathways offered by hypertext systems, the concept of controlled guided instruction has become particularly influential. The term \"guided tour\" has come into use, following the terminology used in NoteCards. In the following presentation, we will use the English term in this case. \"Guided tours\" are mainly useful for supporting unattended users, preferably in learning environments, but also generally for orientation in complex hypertext bases. Also with \"guided tours\" the users of the system, as with all paths, are led through relevant, coherent parts of the hypertext base. According to Zellweger (1989), the special art of building guided tours is to write instructions (in the case of NoteCards in the form of scripts) that do not define deterministic paths, as in techniques of programmed instruction, but ones in which the sequences of links remain non-linear. Furthermore, it should be possible to leave the guided tours at any point. In the following, we will take a closer look at the concept of the \"guided tour\" realized in NoteCards as presented by Marshall/Irish (1989)."
