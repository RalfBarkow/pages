The average response to the interview question lasted 90 minutes.\n* They noticed that time period of focus caused one dimension of the lay out and that internal vs external formed another dimension. What seemed unique in the business literature of the time was that there were five grouping of responses that referred to people rather than just environment or business processes, materials, and structures. That become the middle column, with environment placed on the right side and internal function placed on the left--which is obviously arbitrary and can be switched if useful for illustrating interactions between entities--though this is seldom if ever been done previously."
