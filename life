        "text": "Maturana must have followed all this with the greatest concern. He continued to give his lectures. At one point he devoted an entire semester to the question of a theory of the organism and later reported that at the end of that semester a student came up to him and told him that he now knew everything about the production of proteins from proteins, but still did not understand what \"life\" was. Maturana did not know the answer. He devoted his semester break to the question and found the answer in his concept of autopoiesis. Autopoiesis, self-generation, is understood as a process that extracts from the components of a living being, primarily cells and proteins, not only the components of the living being but also the network of generation of the components of the living being. [[Life]] is an unfolded tautology. It is a one-time invention that has been repeated in an infinite number of forms since life existed on Earth. Life, so the consequence from this consideration, cannot be explained from its origin, but only from its continuation. One can speculate about the processes that preceded the emergence of life from the primordial soup, but the crucial point is not its emergence but its reproduction. Life is its own (\"autos\") work (\"poiesis\")."
