Holling\" | 1996 | Engineering Within Ecological Constraints | National Academies at https://www.nap.edu/read/4919/chapter/4\n\nFrom a systems perspective, the question is where we draw the boundary. I appreciated the title of Ward's book \"The Wiki Way\", because it wasn't about \"The Wiki Technology\" exclusively. Thus, I approach the system boundary not just around the technology and artifacts, but want to include the human people who are involved with wiki. We might aim to have human systems with graceful extensibility ... but that's not usually the way we talk about human beings.\n\nWoods cites [[Elinor Ostrom]], but then doesn't really go into her work.  I had the opportunity to see this Nobel Prize winner before she passed away.  http://coevolving.com/commons/index.php/20110315-0830-ostrom-social-ecological-systems-approach-to-sustainability .
