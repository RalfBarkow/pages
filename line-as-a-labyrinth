What is at stake here is not only the transformation of the labyrinthine discourse from myth to narrative model, but the wholesale transformation of the narrative as well as narrative path in general. First, it can be stated that Kafka's labyrinth - geometrically or analytically speaking - is not a winding or tangled path and not an aberration, but not a path at all. This is its new historical and systematic dimension. When Kafka once spoke of there being perhaps a \"goal\" but \"no way\" - \"what we call way is hesitation\" - , this contains an elementary definition of the labyrinthine structure. According to this, the labyrinth is a series of intervals or spatia, or more precisely: it results from infnitesimal divisions, dividing sections into smaller ones and dese into smaller ones again. The labyrinth is an infinite interpolation process, an arbitrary continuation of the continuum. Labyrinthine is a line that stops at each of its points and changes direction, branching and thus becoming discontinuous. Since the nineteenth century, mathematicians have described this with some discomfort as functions that are discontinuous everywhere, as *nowhere differential functions* (Norbert Wiener) that settle into a \"monstrous oscillation\" and remain wholly unmanifest: The path or continuum is no longer, as with Aristotle, that which is indivisible and traversed in one go, from beginning to end; its line is rather scanned point by point and leads to a kind of permanent occupation with any interval, no matter how small."

      "text": "This fissuring or atomization of the continuum can be grasped with a paradox formulated by the mathematician Hermann Hankel in 1870, which looks like an illustration of Kafka's labyrinth. According to this paradox, a square of side length 1 is divided by horizontal and vertical parallels of equal distance into a grid of small squares. If one takes the path from the lower left corner of the square to the upper right corner, the distance covered – whether one chooses the baseline and the right side line or another course – is always = 2. If one now chooses a path which leads upwards in a staircase as close as possible to the diagonal and if one also lets the number of squares in the net grow to infinity, the infinitely stepped curve apparently coincides with the diagonal and then results in the absurdity: the distance covered by the staircase curve is still = 2, but at the same time=✓2, i.e. the path of the diagonal. In fact, however, the boundary curve of the staircase curve is of a completely different nature: While the tangent of the diagonal has the same value or angle for all its points, the tangent of the stepped boundary curve varies in each of its points in any interval between 0° and 90°. Thus, at none of its points can the boundary curve be assigned a particular direction. Its length is not only different from the path of the diagonal, but at each of its infinite points its course and direction itself are at stake (cf. fig. 3). This results in the labyrinth of a line that \"errs\" in all its points, branches out and interrupts the continuation of its path, a permanent dithering of the course. As little as the threshold space of Kafka's Schloß corresponds to a geometry of spatial extension, it obviously converges with the problems of modern calculus. And perhaps - besides Kafka and modern mathematics - only Paul Klee has attempted a graph for this labyrinth of lines (fig. 4)."
