What is at stake here is not only the transformation of the labyrinthine discourse from myth to narrative model, but the wholesale transformation of the narrative as well as narrative path in general. First, it can be stated that Kafka's labyrinth - geometrically or analytically speaking - is not a winding or tangled path and not an aberration, but no path at all.
