Why I didn't trial for that rugby league team for example? And why I invested so much time in postgraduate study and chasing promotions. There have been insights that I didn't expect, or want."

      "text": "The 'armoring up' that promotions to larger schools, collecting qualifications and 'being published' offered was to protect me from criticism from others and legitimise my voice. I appreciate I applied the industrial age mindset of control and engineering in my approach to school leadership many times. I was a knower. Paradoxically what remained below the surface was a nagging feeling of self doubt and unmet potential. This reflection has been a difficult, sometimes confronting, and it become a journey of unlearning and re-learning."

'to do'. I'll start with setting the context through the story about schooling."
