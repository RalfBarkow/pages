Why didn't I trial for that rugby league team? Become an architect? And why was I so invested in postgraduate study and chasing promotions? There have been insights that emerged that I didn't expect."

      "text": "I now realise that the motivation for 'armoring up' through promotions to larger schools, collecting qualifications and 'being published' was to protect me from criticism and legitimise my voice. I appreciate now that these so called ‘achievements’ led me to apply the industrial age mindset of control and engineering outcomes in my approach to school leadership. I used this strategy many times I suspect – it allowed me to be a self-important ‘knower'. That doesn't mean my intent was in some way ill-informed, self serving or corrupt. However I now accept that this approach was less effective than it should have been."

It's late in the 'second half' of my career, and while the result is uncertain, it’s indeed becoming important. Having the courage to reinvent myself has resulted in a new mindset about human potential, motivation and a new understanding about learning."

My story brings together a  career in education, mostly in schools, the recognition that being a Constructive Discontent is the precursor for creative breakthroughs,  and the essential need for us all to take action... 'to do'... to enable fast iterative cycles of learning. I'll start with setting the context through my story about schooling."
