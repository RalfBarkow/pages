I see that with this mindset I have at times also applied the industrial age approaches of control and engineering in my approach to school leadership. This reflection has been a difficult, sometimes confronting, journey to unlearning and re-learning. What was below the surface until recently was a nagging feeling of self doubt and unmet potential.

To use a sporting analogy; there is nothing less important than the score at half time. Its late in the 'second half' of my career, and the score is becoming important. The constructive discontent that I see myself as is alive and well. What I have accepted with others I have the [[Courage]] to walk the necessary path."

A boy in my class, for some unknow reason, pushed me, and then when I went to stand my ground punched me in the face. The implication of that 10 second event impacted me more than I recognised for a long time."
