Why I didn't trial for that rugby league team for example? And why I invested so much time in postgraduate study and chasing promotions. There have been insights that I didn't expect, or want."

      "text": "The motivation for 'armoring up' through promotions to larger schools, collecting qualifications and 'being published' was to protect me from criticism and legitimise my voice. I appreciate now that this allowed me, at times, to apply the industrial age mindset of control and engineering in my approach to school leadership. I did this many times I suspect. It allowed me to be 'a knower'. That doesn't mean my intent was in some way ill-informed, self serving or corrupt. But the method applied to get to the goal might have been less than effective. "

Its late in the 'second half' of my career, and while the result is uncertain, it is indeed becoming important. Having the courage to reinvent my self has resulted in a new mindset about human potential, motivation and a new understanding about learning."

My story brings together a  career in education, mostly in schools, the recognition that being a Constructive Discontent is the precursor for creative breakthroughs,  and the essential need for us all to take action... 'to do'... to enable fast iterative cycles of learning. I'll start with setting the context through my story about schooling."
