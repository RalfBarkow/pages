        "text": "I was born in 1987 to teenage parents living in Superior, Arizona. Both my mother’s people and father’s people trace their roots back to Mexico and to the Iberian peninsula before that. My maternal great-great grandfather worked in Superior’s copper smelter, as did my maternal and paternal great-grandfathers and grandfathers. My grandmothers were enterprising homemakers and raised large families. I grew up living with my parents and grandparents and received the blessings of being raised in a safe, healthy, loving, environment."
