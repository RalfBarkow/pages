There was a tendency I found worrying, for Robin to focus in his writing on forms (frequently, innovative post-Fordist forms; also, forms of innovative industrial and commercial practice) and not to write about either the activist *formations* that will produce transformation or the practice of **producing** the formations - the work and skill and craft tradition of animating, weaving, choreographing and being-in activist practices of making: the politics of production that is central for the practice of labour process theory-of-practice. At times I felt I was reading accounts of the *technics* of radical industrial-economic forms: Robin did *relish* post-Fordist inventiveness! Where was the aspiration of liberation, the cultivation of skill, the rehearsal of genres, the texture and movement of an activist life, the aesthetic of mutuality and open-heartedness, the capacity for instigating *movement* in the movements, the dance of knowing and organising; and the capability in that dance; and the *production* of that capability?\n\n\n"

But we are not Robin, and we don’t all have such capacity. Moreover, it’s my own belief - being a person of melancholic means rather than sanguine as Robin was - that such things are by no means to be taken for granted in humans (either the capacity or the generosity of spirit: people continually do stunningly dumb, lazy, self-deceiving, self-centred and primitive things) and that mundane *theory* of such desirable practice - the practice of radical organising - is a must. And thus, that theory of the practice of *producing* the radical life and vision and skill of the organiser is as necessary as (somewhat grand) theory of the practice of capitals or theory of the practice of classes in struggle or theory that might underpin a radical economic policy of a country or region or enterprise.\n\n\n"
