The problem with a deep seated dressage saddle with big knee rolls is that it is much less versatile. Fine if all you want to do is flatwork with long stirrup length. If you wanted to go for a gallop or pop a few fences it's possible in the Wintec 500 dressage saddle. You can put the stirrups up because there is no knee roll. But if I planned to do this regularly I'd get myself a decent GP - maybe another Wintec.",
