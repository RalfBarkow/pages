Educators who empowered me through deeply seeing me and hearing my voice. They didn’t pave the way for me but rather, they gave me opportunities. Many too bold and terrifying at first glance. The very act of offering, prompting a journey of self-discovery and awakening me to my truth and to a new narrative identity. "

When our perceived potential is illuminated by another we develop the courage to shift that potential which we realise. There's a transformative power. We all want our learners to flourish, to feel our belief as they journey. We must provide opportunities that illuminate their potential for them. It is then that they might boldly step into it."
