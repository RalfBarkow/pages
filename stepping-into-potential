Educators who empowered me through deeply seeing me and hearing my voice. They didn’t pave the way for me but rather, they gave me opportunities – many too bold and terrifying at first glance. The very act of offering, prompting a journey of self-discovery and awakening me to my truth and to a new narrative identity. "

When our perceived potential is illuminated by another we develop the courage to shift that potential which we realise. There's a transformative power. We all want our learners to flourish, to embrace our belief in them as they journey. We must provide opportunities that illuminate their potential – it’s then that they might boldly step into it."

Through chaos and courageously walking the unknown path, our realised potential is shifted, we find that it is endless. Our gift to ourselves and others is unearthing it. "
