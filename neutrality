If one of the five permanent members of the Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) or one of its allies, which were vetoed, committed an act of aggression, the permanent member could, by exercising its veto, prevent both the designation of the aggressor and the taking of measures to restore international peace and security.

In the absence of action by the Security Council, commentators in Germany therefore assumed the application of the law of neutrality and its violation by the arms deliveries to Ukraine.3)"

However, the Federal Republic did not invoke the right of collective self-defense with regard to the arms deliveries; in particular, it did not inform the Security Council about these arms deliveries. Under the second sentence of Article 51 of the UN Charter, however, measures taken by a state in the exercise of its right of self-defense must be reported immediately to the Security Council. In contrast, after the armed terrorist attack on the United States on September 11, 2001, and the armed attacks by the terrorist organization Islamic State on Iraq, France, and other states, the German government had immediately informed the Security Council of the measures taken in the context of collective self-defense. One reason for not invoking the collective right of self-defense is likely to be that this would make Germany a joint belligerent (\"co-belligerent\") with Ukraine against Russia."

Third states may only assert the responsibility of the lawbreaker, i.e. they may demand that the lawbreaker, among other things, put an end to the attack in violation of international law and make reparations to the injured state.\n\nThe taking of countermeasures by third states is highly controversial in international law.

For international law, it was irrelevant whether wars were waged for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all.

The underlying idea was that all parties to the treaty had an interest in sanctioning the aggressor. Neutrality was replaced by the new status of non-belligerence (\"non-belligerency\").

Discrimination between belligerents, he said, represented a return to the international law doctrine of the 17th and 18th centuries, which distinguished between just and unjust wars. From this distinction, the legal duty to discriminate against a state waging an unjust war, i.e., a war without a cause recognized by international law, was derived at that time. In the 20th century, the outlawing of war under international law led to all states having an interest in maintaining peace. Aggression, he said, constitutes a violation of international law against any state that entitles, but does not obligate, that state to support the attacked state by any means. Jackson stated verbatim, \"It can no longer be argued that the civilized world must behave in a strictly impartial manner both toward an aggressor ... and toward the victims of an unprovoked attack. We must not be indifferent between the worse and the better cause, nor must we treat the just and the unjust equally. ... A system of international law which cannot punish a lawbreaker and which also forbids other states to help the victim would be self-defeating and would not contribute even in the slightest way to the realization of mankind's hope for lasting peace.\""

This allows states to supply arms and other war material to other states within the framework of their general freedom of action. In the absence of a violation of international law, the supply of arms to the aggressor state cannot therefore be a reason for countermeasures and certainly not a reason for violent reprisals by the aggressor against the arms-supplying state.

Similarly, when Iraq invaded Kuwait during the Second Gulf War in August 1990, the Security Council condemned the Iraqi invasion as a breach of international peace and imposed sanctions on Iraq. In doing so, the Council made it explicitly clear that its decisions did not preclude support for the government of Kuwait. There was no room for impartiality toward the parties to the conflict in these cases-the law of neutrality did not apply."

As early as 1949, the U.S. international law scholar and later International Court of Justice judge Philip C. Jessup identified a \"gap\" in the UN's collective security system. If one of the five permanent members of the Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) or one of its allies, which were vetoed, committed an act of aggression, the permanent member could, by exercising its veto, prevent both the designation of the aggressor and the taking of measures to restore international peace and security. In this case, German international law doctrine2) in particular also assumed that the classical law of neutrality should continue to apply."

However, the Federal Republic did not invoke the right of collective self-defense with regard to the arms deliveries; in particular, it did not inform the Security Council about these arms deliveries. Under the second sentence of Article 51 of the UN Charter, however, measures taken by a state in the exercise of its right of self-defense must be reported immediately to the Security Council. In contrast, after the armed terrorist attack on the United States on September 11, 2001, and the armed attacks by the terrorist organization Islamic State on Iraq, France, and other states, the German government had immediately informed the Security Council of the measures taken in the context of collective self-defense. One reason for not invoking the collective right of self-defense is likely to be that this would make Germany a joint belligerent (\"co-belligerent\") with Ukraine against Russia."

These allow a violated state to respond to an act in violation of international law by temporarily failing to fulfill its obligations under international law - in this case, the duty of impartiality under the law of neutrality - in order to induce the lawbreaker to end the violation.\n\nRussia's aggression against Ukraine is undoubtedly an act in violation of international law; however, the state thereby violated is Ukraine, not Germany. Third states may only assert the responsibility of the lawbreaker, i.e. they may demand that the lawbreaker, among other things, put an end to the attack in violation of international law and make reparations to the injured state.\n\nThe taking of countermeasures by third states is highly controversial in international law. Even if one were to assume that in the present case any state other than the violated state would also be authorized to take countermeasures, neither Germany nor any other state has justified its arms deliveries to Ukraine as a countermeasure."

Classical neutrality law developed in the 19th century, i.e. at a time when states had an unrestricted right to wage war. For international law, it was irrelevant whether wars were waged for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all. All belligerents, whether aggressor or aggressed, were to be treated equally by neutrals - the neutrality obligations of abstention, impartiality, and interdiction extended equally to both parties.\n\nThis changed with the prohibition of war in international law in the first half of the 20th century. With war illegal under international law, no rights for the aggressor, in particular no right to non-discrimination, could arise from it - ex injuria jus non oritur."

This opened the way for financial or material support to the attacked state - including with war material. The underlying idea was that all parties to the treaty had an interest in sanctioning the aggressor. Neutrality was replaced by the new status of non-belligerence (\"non-belligerency\"). Contrary to a widespread view in the literature, non-lligerency is not an intermediate stage between neutrality and a state of war, but a legal status replacing neutrality."

The concept of nonbelligerence as a legal status distinct from neutrality was also taken up again at the Amsterdam meeting of the International Law Association in 1938 in a memorandum on \"Nonbelligerence and Neutrality\" presented by the German section. This stated that the new legal position was not strictly impartial toward the belligerents."

Direct participation in the war had not yet been communicated to the American population before the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941."

Discrimination between belligerents, he said, represented a return to the international law doctrine of the 17th and 18th centuries, which distinguished between just and unjust wars. From this distinction, the legal duty to discriminate against a state waging an unjust war, i.e., a war without a cause recognized by international law, was derived at that time. In the 20th century, the outlawing of war under international law led to all states having an interest in maintaining peace. Aggression, he said, constitutes a violation of international law against any state that entitles, but does not obligate, that state to support the attacked state by any means. Jackson stated verbatim, \"It can no longer be argued that the civilized world must behave in a strictly impartial manner both toward an aggressor ... and toward the victims of an unprovoked attack. We must not be indifferent between the worse and the better cause, nor must we treat the just and the unjust equally. ... A system of international law which cannot punish a lawbreaker and which also forbids other states to help the victim would be self-defeating and would not contribute even in the slightest way to the realization of mankind's hope for lasting peace.\""

If it is subsequently determined that there was no aggression in violation of international law, the unassisted belligerent may, if necessary, assert the state's responsibility under international law for an act in violation of international law."

For example, in the First Gulf War between Iran and Iraq in 1980-1988, both sides invoked the right of self-defense. A determination of the aggressor may also be omitted for alliance or other reasons. In such cases, states remain free to adopt a neutral stance. Hugo Grotius, the father of modern international law, had already argued in the early 17th century that states should treat all belligerents equally when it was doubtful whose cause was \"just.\""

Although Russia's exercise of its veto power prevented a Security Council determination of aggression, the General Assembly created a special residual procedure for just such a case back in 1950. Under its resolution No. 377(V), \"United for Peace,\" in cases where there appears to be a threat to or breach of the peace or aggression, and where the Security Council is unable, as a result of an exercise of the veto by a permanent member, to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the General Assembly may promptly consider the question and make appropriate recommendations to member states for collective action to maintain or restore international peace and security. If the General Assembly is not in session, it may convene within twenty-four hours at the request of the Security Council for a special emergency session. Unlike the question of the existence of aggression, the Security Council's recourse to the General Assembly is merely a procedural matter over which the permanent members have no veto power."

Unlike the Security Council, the General Assembly cannot make a legally binding determination of aggressor, but its resolutions are widely viewed as expressing the views of world opinion. In the international law literature, a two-thirds majority in the Genreal Assembly has been considered sufficient to put the individual determination of aggressor by individual states beyond doubt as to their bona fides. With 141 votes in favor of the resolution, this criterion is more than met."

This duty is likely to favor only the aggressor in the majority of cases anyway. The non-application of the law of neutrality has no disadvantages for the states not involved in the war. Relations between the non-belligerent and belligerent states continue to be governed by the law of peace. This allows states to supply arms and other war material to other states within the framework of their general freedom of action. In the absence of a violation of international law, the supply of arms to the aggressor state cannot therefore be a reason for countermeasures and certainly not a reason for violent reprisals by the aggressor against the arms-supplying state. The latter would in any case be opposed by the UN Charter's prohibition of the use of force. Measures of force are in principle permissible only in response to an armed attack. However, arms deliveries as such do not constitute such an attack."

        "text": "In view of the obvious Russian aggression against Ukraine, any invocation of the classic law of neutrality and the associated equal treatment of the warring parties would be tantamount to a legal and moral declaration of bankruptcy. To intervene directly in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict with one's own armed forces to defend Ukraine seems inadvisable because of the possibility of an escalation and expansion of the war. Supplying weapons to the illegally attacked state is thus the least that Germany and other states can do in view of the Security Council's inaction to maintain and restore international peace and security and to defend the international legal order. International law does not condemn states to stand idly by and watch aggression; on the contrary, a value-based international law that prohibits the use of force in interstate relations and sanctions the offense of aggression under international criminal law virtually demands support for the victim of aggression."
