        "text": "While Luhmann’s concept of [[Structural Coupling]] does connect minds and society, the concept of [[Operational Closure]] still subverts a traditional idealistic assumption and aspiration that is almost considered common sense even until today, namely that society either is or ought to be guided by human reason. Social [[Institution]]s are still often conceived of as grounded in human ideas. The law, for instance, can be understood as the result of the human endeavour to make society more just; similarly, the academic system can be understood as a social manifestation of the human desire for knowledge."
