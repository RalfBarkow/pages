If not, be sure to cool down with plenty of walk on a long rein in the arena. Or dismount and finish as you started with stretchy work on the lunge. Alternatively, this could be a good time for you and your horse to go for a walk together in the countryside. You could ride, but I think it’s nicer for you both to walk together.",
