The latter allows a great deal more -correct- inference, whereas '40% chair' has semantic issues (what does 40% chair mean to you?) and doesn't lead to any sort of meaningful inference. I'll certainly agree with your statement that it is hardly a big win. Its primary examples are prototype-words (tall, short, warm, cool, fat, thin), but even these have semantic issues (60% warm???) and may be better handled by bayesian logics (I'm 90% confident that Bob would say it's 'warm', and I'm his thermostat, so I'll say it's warm.)</i>",

I checked my handy-dandy dictionary and the primary definition read something like this: \"Having sense perception; conscious.\" I then looked up the word conscious: \"Having an awareness of one's environment and one's own existence, sensations, and thoughts.\" So sentience breaks down to being self-aware. It has been shown by scientists that a few species of primate(chimpanzees, bonobos, and orang-utans most notably) are in fact self-aware - I have read about it on multiple occasions and have seen it on television more than a few.

I checked my handy-dandy dictionary and the primary definition read something like this: \"Having sense perception; conscious.\" I then looked up the word conscious: \"Having an awareness of one's environment and one's own existence, sensations, and thoughts.\" So sentience breaks down to being self-aware. It has been shown by scientists that a few species of primate(chimpanzees, bonobos, and orang-utans most notably) are in fact self-aware - I have read about it on multiple occasions and have seen it on television more than a few. The science books you grew up reading in high school and college and such probably would not agree with me, but most of those are outdated.

An object was chosen and hidden somewhere in the room. Then a miniature version af the object was shown to the ape and then they placed it in the same place in the model. The ape was then sent in alone to find it and was able to find it with the same accuracy as a 4-year-old child. You have provoked some great thought in me as to the nature of this issue.

Could even be like a Wiki where the topology, weights, training would be arbitrarily specified and modified by many users over internet. Even if each person added a few neurons/connections and test inputs/outputs once a week, or [[Nn Vandals]] scrambled it, most would want to see it grow it would become more and more intelligent over time. Perl has AI::[[Neural Net]] modules available with the standard distribution for free it would be relatively easy to set up a cgi interface to create this (use mysql to store the topology and weights). Similar to [[Open Mind]] ([http://commonsense.media.mit.edu/cgi-bin/search.cgi commonsense.media.mit.edu]) but that implementation does not let you query yet and is not based on [[Neural Networks]] as far as I know. Users can input random data over internet but the architecture is controlled centrally. Another that is NN based is \"20 Questions\" [http://www.20q.net/index.html www.20q.net] but seems very basic.",

It involves seeding a relatively small net with values, then using quasi-realtime evaluation of inputs and neuron firing. Training would involve sending strings of characters (or other desired information) and a self-organizing learning mechanism. The learning algorithm would not only alter weights but connections and simulated cell growth(strategic addition of neurons). Decaying unused connections, strengthening commonly used ones, and sprouting new ones when localized activity seems to suggest it should happen. The web interface would be used to provide input from the masses. It seems to me that (only in theory) this is like the biological process in more ways than traditional forward and back propagation nets. I have know idea of various implementation details, even certain parts of the math. There is also an issue with continuous input being required to run the net. I don't know if it would even provide interesting results even because it relies on the ability of the input values to induce patterns in the net (of what variety I couldn't be sure). Haven't gotten very far in trying to implement anything of this nature as I completely break down when it comes to deciding on solid learning rules. -- [[Timothy Seguine]] ",

What you're assuming, unconsciously perhaps, is that designing the Bot to distinguish relevant and irrelevant web-pages returned from a search will somehow be an 'easy' problem... or that it will be wholly solved for you by Google such that you can borrow off the intelligence already invested into the network organization. It is not an 'easy' problem, and the search will never reach that level of organization unless Google both solves this problem first and offers an unambiguous ontology for the searching (Web 3.0 quality stuff... it might happen). This problem is far deeper than you're giving it credit for... deep enough that accomplishing the task is, by itself, a very significant accomplishment. What I see you doing is either waving your hands to make the problem go away or (giving less credit to you) a complete ignorance of problem. I ask again: how will you distinguish web-pages about 'apple' (the fruit) and 'apple' (the company) in a systematic manner that extends to a great many subjects other than the apple? Think about it.

That very success—and the slowness with which both the academic community and the general public have come to recognise it—has shown how little we understand our own intelligence, and its role in our lives and culture. Here I attempt to address this problem of understanding, exploiting a variety of scientific evidence, including social simulation. I begin by reviewing current progress in AI, which is profound but underestimated. I suggest this lack of recognition is due to the mistaken belief that intelligence implies agency. I next examine the related question of human uniqueness: why do only we have language and extensive built culture? I use models and data to show that the propensities to use culture, share information and behave altruistically are neither unique to humans nor inexplicable to biology, but rather our uniqueness hinges on the extent of our capacities for communication and memory. Finally, I apply the impact of AI on extending our intelligence to these theories, to predict—and observe—consequences of AI on human societies and individual human lives. I make and support policy recommendations based on these predictions.\n"

        "text": "> If [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) were achievable, what would the consequences be for human society? Perhaps surprisingly, the answer to this question is already at hand. We are achieving rapid and accelerating success in our quest to build AI. That very success—and the slowness with which both the academic community and the general public have come to recognise it—has shown how little we understand our own intelligence, and its role in our lives and culture. Here I attempt to address this problem of understanding, exploiting a variety of scientific evidence, including social simulation. I begin by reviewing current progress in AI, which is profound but underestimated. I suggest this lack of recognition is due to **the mistaken belief that intelligence implies [[Agency]]**. I next examine the related question of human uniqueness: why do only we have language and extensive built culture? I use models and data to show that the propensities to use culture, share information and behave altruistically are neither unique to humans nor inexplicable to biology, but rather our uniqueness hinges on the extent of our capacities for communication and memory. Finally, I apply the impact of AI on extending our intelligence to these theories, to predict—and observe—consequences of AI on human societies and individual human lives. I make and support policy recommendations based on these predictions.\n"
