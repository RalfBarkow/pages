Then evalaulating how far the reach is of the incident, and how that relates to your \"objective\" function.  For example, if a system fails, but the fall over works, and customers can't tell the difference, then the pressures are \"surge capacity\", money, engineering/IT resources etc.  Or if the reach does impact customers, then it impacts users, sales, etc.  Probably lots of insights to be gotten from spending some time exploring the CLD.\n",
