      "text": "Luhmann's first sentence in The Reality of the Mass Media, however, not only has what it takes to capture the attention of the mass media for a short period of time, but also challenges theoretical convictions and benefits from the fact that in scientific communication, while truth, plausibility, and knowledge gain are expected first, the community also appreciates \"ground breaking,\" paradigm shifts, or even particularly innovative or risky projects, to put it in the language of research funding. The phrase has what it takes because Luhmann uses it to radically dismiss the very common belief that what we \"know about the world in which we live\" comes from that space of our experience that Husserl called \"lifeworld\" (1982, p. 32). \"The world,\" in Husserl's phenomenology, \"is given pre-scientifically in everyday sensory experience subjectively-relatively. Each of us has its appearances, and to each they count as that which really exists\" (1982, p. 22). These experiences are \"subjectively-relatively given\", and from this Husserl concludes that one can be convinced that \"the really existing\" actually also exists objectively-absolutely, even if everyone experiences this being just differently (subjectively): \"Necessarily we believe in the world with the same things appearing to us only differently\" (Husserl 1982, p. 22). Jürgen Habermas has placed the concept of lifeworld in the center of his theory of communicative action and, among other things, with regard to the modern mass media, has expressed the concern that this lifeworld is being bureaucratized, destroyed, dissolved, alienated (Habermas 1981, p. 480 ff.). According to Habermas in a critique of Luhmann, one will \"hardly be able to do without the Husserlian [...] concept of lifeworld\" if one wants to take into account the basic fact of linguistic socialization. Participants in interaction cannot perform speech acts that have a coordinating effect without assuming that all participants have an intersubjectively shared lifeworld that runs toward the speech situation and is anchored in the center of the body. Each lifeworld, he argues, is central to the identity of those in the first person singular or plural of a society, as it reproduces the interpretive patterns that give meaning to human life\" (Stark 2009, p. 175). Carsten Stark points out that Habermas considers this lifeworld resource to be threatened by \"media-driven systemic communication\" (2009, p. 175), which is developing into a \"colonization of the lifeworld\" (Habermas 1981, p. 471 f.). And Habermas considers Luhmann's systems theory to be part of the problem because it \"no longer internally brackets culture, society, and person in the structures of the lifeworld\" (Habermas 1985, p. 441, Herv. i. Orig. ) and allows the \"intersubjectively shared lifeworld to slip through between system types that, like the mental and social systems, form environments for each other\" (Habermas 1985, p. 436).act in an understanding-oriented way, a totality of contexts of meaning and icing\" (Habermas 1985, p. 416). For Habermas, it is the primordial \"resource\" of cultural reproduction, social integration, and socialization (1985, p. 399 f.). Accordingly, what we consider to be a we at all, that knows something about our society and the world in which we live, is produced and reproduced lifeworld-wise. \"The lifeworld is essential for the existence […]"

      "text": "In 1993, Niklas Luhmann refers precisely to this theoretical context, which seems to him implausible and outdated. First, however, he concedes: \"In everyday life, one normally presupposes that the world is the way it is, and that disagreements are a result of different 'subjective' perspectives, experiences, memories.\" Surprisingly, according to Luhmann, \"the social sciences [... ] methodologically still be in search of 'the' reality and only allow for a historical, ethnic, or culturally conditioned relativism\"-instead of pursuing the question of \"the construction of the reality of the modern world and its social system\"; a question that leads Luhmann to the mass media, since the \"system of science\" by no means exclusively and bindingly \"guarantees for society the coming into being of reality\" and because \"knowledge of the world\" is produced and reproduced with great resonance in the \"system of mass media\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 138 f.). The crucial sociological question, therefore, is not \"whether what the media report is true or not true,\" or \"whether it is half true or half not true because it is 'manipulated'\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 15). It is: by what operations is the reality of the mass media constructed as \"what appears as reality to them and through them to others\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 14). This can still be an imposition today. This also seems understandable when it comes, for example, to a critique of the media dissemination of those 'alternative facts' for which the spokespersons and communications directors of the Trump administration have quickly become famous and infamous. Whether it rained at the inauguration or the sun shone can be clearly established, and a fact does not allow for an alternative, but corresponds to reality or fails \"against reality\" (Habermas 1971a, p. 219 f.). The Danish philosophers Vincent F. Hendricks and Mads Vestergaard are as certain as Habermas: \"Be that as it may, facts are facts. Statements regarding factual matters are either true or false\" (Hendricks and Vestergaard 2019, p. 52). "

The mass media's current efforts at so-called fact-checking shares this view. Assuming that publicity is possible without manipulation, Habermas promotes a \"critical publicity\" that does not degrade mass media to a \"vehicle of controlled journalistic influence\" (Habermas 1990, p. 356 f.)."

      "text": "Luhmann's volte-face against Habermas and Husserl is thus still relevant and provocative. His argument against the eternal repetition of the question of how \"the mass media distort reality by the way they present it\" is that this question would presuppose an \"ontological, existing, objectively accessible, construction-free cognizable reality\" along the lines of the \"old essence cosmos\" instead of assuming that every reality is always the reality of an observer and that the epistemologically appropriate and heuristically rewarding question is rather: \"How do mass media construct reality?\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 20) - a question, by the way, that would also be illuminating for the dissemination of 'alternative facts', because this is also how reality is constructed and knowledge is created that can be assumed in others. To assume that there is media access to the world as it factually is, however, would not even be necessary for such an approach. Luhmann, who is always observing his observations, is clear about this: Those who \"cling to notions such as 'objective truth' or psychologically 'binding' consensus will not be able to accept this analysis and will accuse the media of superficiality, if not manipulation. If, on the other hand, one takes seriously the [...] operative closedness of autopoietic systems, one sees: There is no other way\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 198).\n"

His argument against the eternal repetition of the question of how \"the mass media distort reality by the way they present it\" is that this question would presuppose an \"ontological, existing, objectively accessible, construction-free cognizable reality\" along the lines of the \"old essence cosmos\" instead of assuming that every reality is always the reality of an observer and that the epistemologically appropriate and heuristically rewarding question is rather: \"How do mass media construct reality?\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 20) - a question, by the way, that would also be illuminating for the dissemination of 'alternative facts', because this is also how reality is constructed and knowledge is created that can be assumed in others. To assume that there is media access to the world as it factually is, however, would not even be necessary for such an approach. Luhmann, who is always observing his observations, is clear about this: Those who \"cling to notions such as 'objective truth' or psychologically 'binding' consensus will not be able to accept this analysis and will accuse the media of superficiality, if not manipulation. If, on the other hand, one takes seriously the [...] operative closedness of autopoietic systems, one sees: There is no other way\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 198)."
