        "text": "If, according to the dialectic, to [[determine]] limits already implies to exceed them, then the consciousness of one's own mortality always presupposes the thought of immortality. But this thought, for its part, would have to be understood as a hypostasized expression of an existential judgment. Thus even the commonplace that one lives only once is to be seen through as a threat or descendant of the death drive. And the \"weak messianic force\" of which Benjamin speaks in the Theses On the Concept of History, which cannot be a consolation, which rather denies it, would consist in persistently pointing out death as the first point in the index falsi - index of those relations in which, according to Marx, \"man is a degraded, a subjugated, an abandoned, a contemptible being.\" For all relations are to be overturned, in which the death of man gets a meaning."
