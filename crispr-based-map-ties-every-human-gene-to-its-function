The Perturb-seq map was derived from CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, which introduces genetic changes in cells, then applies single-cell RNA sequencing to record data about RNAs yielded by a given change. The researchers scaled up the technique to encompass the full human genome; MIT's Jonathan Weissman used human blood cancer cell lines and noncancerous retinal cells to conduct [[Perturb-seq]] across 2.5 million-plus cells, and constructed a map linking genotypes to phenotypes.
