        "text": "yeah um the individual versus the collective mind versus body machines versus manual me versus others differentiation versus integration and big business and government versus neighborhoods all these things really really truly need to be rebalanced and our idea at relocalizing creativity is that we start to look and [[See the System]]s that we're a part of and we participate in doing that actively um we have a tool called a causal Loop diagram or the word that I've now converted it to is a community Loop drawing which essentially allows people to be able to capture their understanding and make explicit their understanding of the way that that their system works their system being their neighborhood and therefore how to optimize it where the leverage points are in that system really really important to be able to do that and to go out and do the experiments and communities to start learning from the system itself and we do that by having conversations what we call campfire conversations cfire conversations and cave drawings yeah go it sounds like it's going backwards but it's not it's very much aided by modern thinking and technology and it's about us all being able to share our understanding because when we pull our understanding we become much more powerful and we're aiming to take that as I said to absolutely every neighborhood in the world um and you're going to hear from one of them later in the next panel uh"
