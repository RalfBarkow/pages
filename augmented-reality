This collaboration provides a “shared truth” — what you see is exactly what I see, I see you perform an action as you do it, and we both see exactly the same dynamic transformation of this shared information space. When you express an idea, the computer, a full participant in this conversation, instantly makes it real for both of us enabling us to critique and negotiate the meaning of it. This shared virtual world will be as live, dynamic, pervasive, and visceral as the physical. Augmented Reality is not just the next wave of collaboration and computing, it is a fundamental shift in how we will engage with our world and each other, and how we will understand and solve the huge problems we face as a species. AR will replace your PC, your phone, your tablet. It will be an always on and always on you supercomputer — it will amplify our intentions and ideas enabling all of us to create and explore new universes together. In this talk, David Smith will introduce the Croquet programming platform for live collaboration, built by some of best known researchers in the history of computer science, and also touch on the core cognitive psychology first principles on which it is based."
