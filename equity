Equality involves treating everyone exactly the same, and as a result has no impact on the uneven positions from which different people start. Equity, in contrast, is sensitive to the different positions of participants and so is potentially transformative of power relations. Existing author order protocols favor equality. Our own protocols foreground equity and are shaped by a shared commitment to consensus, care work, and acknowledgement of social location. We consider each of these in turn below."
