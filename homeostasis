      "text": "Homeostasis is a process whereby critical variables are held within acceptable limits by self regulatory processes. The standard example of homeostasis is the maintenance of body temperature at a constant of 98.6° F. in an environment in which temperature varies considerably. If the self-regulatory processes fail, the system or organism goes into a state of catastrophe. If the temperature control processes in the human body fail, the result is a state of catastrophe called hyper or hypothermia, which rapidly threatens the body's viability. It is perhaps a measure of the lack of common understanding of this process that rescue workers have such a difficult time convincing people that they must take emergency measures at the first sign of hypothermia. It is characteristic of homeostasis that the processes usually involve complex coordination among different parts of the system to achieve this steady state. Living systems, including both organisms and organizations, generally indude many control devices and processes to maintain the stability of their essential variables.\n"
