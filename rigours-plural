The crucial thing about the schema, though, is that it recognises that no practice of knowing and organising is in fact conducted without there being a dance, into and out of and across the quadrants, above- and below-the-line, left-side and right-side; and that there is then also a pivotal family of ‘meta-rigours’ to do with the skilful performing and choreographing of *the dance*. I would say these choreographic capabilities tend to be quite rare: a formation (or a person) is rather likely to make a home in one or other quadrant: “every carpenter thinks that wood is the greatest thing”; equally, a person whose familiar tool is a hammer may treat everything as if it were a nail. Very many people love to be in the storytelling quadrant (in a pretty slack kind of way); we certainly are narrative animals, there is always ‘something ongoing’ that warrants story-sharing. It’s my view that these insights and choreographic principles of the dance of knowing are pivotal in the construction and conduct of any skilful, systematic practice of formacion.\n\n"

        "text": "---\n\nNext: [[Notes on code]] - The digital as a hybrid material-cultural and cultural-aesthetic landscape\n‘The Golemic’ (see xxx above, §1 landscape) is a particularly pivotal field within the dance of knowing and capability, and warrants a couple of notes here given the centrality of the digital in Robin’s perspective on possibilities for a living economy (a post-post Fordist period? ::\\[Murray, Gilbert & Goffin 2014 xxx]::. First, there’s the place of *formalisation* in the dance of knowing, and its important relationship with the material landscape, §1; and second, there’s the question of the particular rigour that attaches to code (software code), which connects the labour-power/labour-process perspective with the aesthetic landscape §3.\n\nOver 35 years’ engagement I’ve come to see  *the digital* as a radically new historical form of materiality, bringing its own particular relations of production. This kind of materiality is constituted *by writing* - that is, as production in the  §2cultural landscape, under the distinctive but extremist rigour of radical formalisation - of *scripts* and (software) *code*. Particular kinds of machines organised by code - popularly ‘computers’, or quaintly, Turing machines - enable the construction of radically extended material systems of self-acting digital machinery, which may do actual heavy lifting (eg flying a helicopter, controlling traffic, cutting metal), through digital media and digital networks, through an emergent ‘internet of things’ and through capabilities lumped together as ‘AI’, such as pattern recognition in ‘wild’ (that is, otherwise incomprehensible, chaotic) corpora of ‘big’ digital data. These are developments of historic significance, much explored since the cultural studies ’cyborg’ debates of the 80s and 90s for example; but with regard to class power and history-making this is much less well trodden. See, though ::\\[Wark xxx; Moody, *New terrain* xxxx; Haraway xxx Cyborg manifesto xxx]::.\n\nWith code - extremely formalised conceptualisation - we’re into the construction of symbol-machines (a long-standing aspiration for rule-based systems such as juridical systems and, from the C15, of the Christian Church ::\\[Illich xxxx]::); and with ‘the golemic’ we’re into gross material machinery. So: writing - a practice of the cultural landscape, §2 - now can organise and direct large and complex dynamic constellations of  material stuff (in the §1 material landscape). It does seem to me that this is a historically new capability, and not simply an epiphenomenon of the latest marque of capitalism - although of course The Capitalisms are hard at work attempting to domesticate the digital, in the present wave of ‘creative destruction’ in the emergent techno-economic paradigm: “move fast, and break things”.\n\nThis capability now has moved well beyond Herb Simon’s early post-Fordist ‘the Artificial’ ::\\[Simon, ‘sciences of the artificial’ xxx]:: and, to put an appropriately emotive aesthetic edge on this, we can think of this still-emergent terrain as *‘the Golemic’*. Golems in mythology - notably the Golem of Prague - are beings of clay that are rendered animated and forceful, but muscle-headed, by placing in their mouth a scroll of religious text (classically, the Torah). The challenge of creating tools *of this kind, for conviviality*, is a radically new one, and an entire post-Fordist repertoire of technics, structures of feeling and cultural formations is emergent (and contested). In recent years, for example, in participant-observer mode, I’ve been hanging-out in free-software, P2P (peer-to-peer), geek circles, and observe an anarcho-libertarian structure of feeling which is not at all easily aligned with the *associationist socialist* structures of feeling that underlie the kind of tradition that I recognise Robin and myself to be working within. There is urgently radical stuff here that spans the material, cultural and aesthetic landscapes and rigours . . all grist for the college mill!\n\nI’m not speaking here of the political economy of *digital goods*, and the problematic (contradictory, post-Fordist, sure-to-fail) attempt to enforce enclosure and commoditisation on digital media; I’m speaking more specifically of the aesthetic affiliations of formations that invest identity in digital means.\n\nWith rigours in general - the ‘look and feel’ of the disciplined or undisciplined relationship that a practice has with its objects - we’re into *structures of feeling*: that is, concerns of landscape §3, the aesthetic landscape. Thus, while the form of formations - the organisation of labour power - is central in the landscape of the dance of knowing, the labour powers themselves (as capacity for actual *performances*) are constituted in the aesthetic landscape, as capacities of judgement and commitment, affiliation and distinction, recognition and naming, attention and self-control. The curriculum of the Faculty of formaciòn work weaves together threads in both landscapes. This is unsurprising: ‘culture’ in general usage is a word that invokes to both the explicit, aware organisation of collective practices, understanding the world and communicating understandings (which is the way in which I am here specialising ‘culture': to signify *labour power*) and also to *the aesthetics* of practice: the ‘feel’ that people have about what ‘we’ are and cannot abide and do and *never* do and want and aspire to and cleave to and dread; to dreams and devils, what is beautiful and alive, and what is diabolical and deadly."
