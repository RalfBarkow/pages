It used to be that the groupthink was restricted to outright religious worship of [[Ward Cunningham]]. And it definitely was religious worship since you couldn't even satirize said worship. [You also weren't allowed to point out that C2 with its totalitarian communist politico-economic model was bound to fail since it could never scale.] But by the mid-00s the corrosive groupthink had spread like a virus, at least in part due to Ward's utterly moronic decision to legitimize it by having a shadowy group of unaccountable tyrants called \"stewards\". That's when C2 jumped the shark for me. And I don't think Ward will ever regain my respect for making that pro-tyrannical decision. \"Yeah totalitarian communism didn't work, so let's try fascism.\" Cause it's not like we learned anything from early 20th century European history now, is it? -- [[Richard Kulisz]]</i>",

Years ago we had a better relationship where we let him speak his mind and we took him seriously, because he was trying to be serious. But now, I'm not sure what he is doing; he is even proud to not read other people's statements with sincerity, integrity, and charity, but rather prefers to brush them off and abuse others. No wiki can function without decorum and mutual respect and sincerity. They are not set up technically to facilitate shouting matches since there is no sanctity of the individual. We are responsible for each other's texts, so we must treat them (and each other) with the respect we wish for ourselves.

Ultimately, the assumption (re: [[Assume Good Faith]]) is that you will still work together after the conflicting view is incorporated into a decision. However, if that common goal is not true here, then either the relationship between the factions must be terminated or the frame has to change away from it being a professional association.

Extreme Programming reiterates those practices as well, if you notice. The point is not that <i>all</i> information belongs to everyone, simply that everyone on the <i>team</i> has equal access to the collective property. The team, however, controls access to its membership. This paradigm has broken down now that the sense of <i>team</i> has dissolved post-XP, when the team leaders vacated, and Wiki is busy attracting people based on its reputation rather than its social network.

However, I recently realized that no one, not even Ward, wants to do this, which is why I give up and want to walk away, since I don't understand nor care for the new model. Another option is to shut down the site, either as a [[Fish Bowl]] or just offline it. I'm mildly in favour of taking it off the 'net, as there is a responsibility to preserve the integrity of older contributor's reputations. Another option is to change the structure of the medium, probably moving closer to something like a more traditional programming discussion site in one direction or Neowiki in the other. Another option is to devolve Wiki into an 'experiment' in seeing whether or not the people here can resolve the conflicts socially (impossible), and I think is totally irresponsible given how many people's reputations are going to be destroyed in the process. [[Meta Baby]] at least was upfront about its purpose. A final option, the status quo, is that superficial technical conflicts are patched over with small technical patches, but the underlying social infrastructure continues to decentralized as contributors devolve into individuals <i>contending</i> for control (rather than <i>working together</i> towards a <i>common</i> goal). That social model is probably what you prefer and would support with Neowiki as a better medium, given your comments of that. In that environment, a serious discussion about the [[Right To Dissent]] would be more valid, I think, since the adversarialness would disrupt a constructive process of dissent. In the 'professional team' frame that probably most of your interlocutors work within, however, the [[Right To Dissent]] seems ridiculous since it would be a 'firable' offence in a business setting.

That's when C2 jumped the shark for me.

The [[Right To Dissent]] that I am familiar with is about process, not about a particular viewpoint, as I am mostly interested in ensuring a functioning process rather than a particular conclusion, per se. With respect to the process, even Conservatives present a dissenting view in Canada, even if it is not as dissenting (in some sort of Hamiltonian distance kind of way, I guess) than your view. A better example, perhaps, may be Falun Gong dissents. ",

What you are talking about is likely very confusing to most of the audience here, who are here rather for a very narrow reason, which is to improve their programming chops. Not many have read anything about what you are talking about on this page, for instance. My own personal interest is tangential and limited to what you have to bear being a university student in his mid-20s. Also w.r.t.

Dissenting in a professional discussion forum (my level of expertise and interest) means negotiating a better outcome evaluated against your 'walk away point' and/or BATNA (Best alternative to a negotiated agreement). Ultimately, the assumption (re: [[Assume Good Faith]]) is that you will still work together after the conflicting view is incorporated into a decision. However, if that common goal is not true here, then either the relationship between the factions must be terminated or the frame has to change away from it being a professional association. It's clear that the ongoing larger conflict here is the bobble between these polarities. This conflict has been going on here for five years, which is another reason to give up on it and start something fresh, new, and stridently moving forward.",

If you consider the original goals of Wiki, it was to facilitate a small group of people from OOSPLA and PLoP (the Hillside group) to build a Pattern language, all of whom had experience in the Smalltalk/OOP world where sharing ownership over the codebase was the best practice. Extreme Programming reiterates those practices as well, if you notice. The point is not that <i>all</i> information belongs to everyone, simply that everyone on the <i>team</i> has equal access to the collective property. The team, however, controls access to its membership. This paradigm has broken down now that the sense of <i>team</i> has dissolved post-XP, when the team leaders vacated, and Wiki is busy attracting people based on its reputation rather than its social network. The structure of the medium, as you have noticed and you criticize w.r.t 'neowiki' (?), insufficiently matches the current social structure. Hence, there are egregious conflicts.",

Alternatively, as Helmut suggests, you can return to the old social model, which is something I would have preferred. However, I recently realized that no one, not even Ward, wants to do this, which is why I give up and want to walk away, since I don't understand nor care for the new model. Another option is to shut down the site, either as a [[Fish Bowl]] or just offline it. I'm mildly in favour of taking it off the 'net, as there is a responsibility to preserve the integrity of older contributor's reputations. Another option is to change the structure of the medium, probably moving closer to something like a more traditional programming discussion site in one direction or Neowiki in the other. Another option is to devolve Wiki into an 'experiment' in seeing whether or not the people here can resolve the conflicts socially (impossible), and I think is totally irresponsible given how many people's reputations are going to be destroyed in the process. [[Meta Baby]] at least was upfront about its purpose. A final option, the status quo, is that superficial technical conflicts are patched over with small technical patches, but the underlying social infrastructure continues to decentralized as contributors devolve into individuals <i>contending</i> for control (rather than <i>working together</i> towards a <i>common</i> goal). That social model is probably what you prefer and would support with Neowiki as a better medium, given your comments of that. In that environment, a serious discussion about the [[Right To Dissent]] would be more valid, I think, since the adversarialness would disrupt a constructive process of dissent. In the 'professional team' frame that probably most of your interlocutors work within, however, the [[Right To Dissent]] seems ridiculous since it would be a 'firable' offence in a business setting. Consequently, they do not really have any idea how to respond. ",

It worked and it was shut down precisely <i>because</i> it worked (threatened the existence of the Central Bank). The people in power don't really have any incentive to moralize economics and so they only do so in those places small enough that the people in power don't have that much power.
