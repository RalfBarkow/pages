A building that is loved by its users because they feel it to be ‘friendly’ will be taken care of and survive normal wear and tear. A blank wall can be interesting if it shows visual texture, but not if that makes it hostile to touch. For example, using smooth slabs of natural materials such as colored marble and travertine creates an intimate bonding with the user up close. (A famous example is the Barcelona Pavilion by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, 1929). This effect can be explained by the new patterns [[Biophilic Urbanism]] and [[Fractal Pattern]], from the fossil microorganisms that comprise the rock. In contradistinction, both tactile and visual senses perceive brutalist concrete as hostile, especially if it maintains the texture of the casting forms. Users could scrape their skin from rubbing against it. Its typical gray color triggers subconscious associations with death (decomposing bodies, putrefied food) and pathologies of the eye-brain system that reduce our vision to grayscale (cerebral achromatopsia from a stroke).
