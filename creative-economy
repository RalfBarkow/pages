Copyrights, patents, and trademarks are important tools for protecting the intellectual property rights of creators and innovators, and for ensuring that they can reap the benefits of their creative and innovative work.\n\nOverall, the creative economy is an important and growing sector of the global economy, with significant potential for job creation, economic growth, and cultural and social development."
