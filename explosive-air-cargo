The Siemens Group was and is significantly involved in equipping and re-equipping the Rosatom plants so that they halfway comply with the safety and operating regulations of the EU. The connection is even closer in the case of uranium enrichment. Urenco operates a uranium enrichment plant in Gronau (Westphalia) that sources an estimated 20 percent of its uranium from Russia and has long disposed of its waste (depleted uranium) discreetly in Siberia. Reportedly, the company now wants to stop shipments \"in both directions.\""

The anti-nuclear citizens' initiatives of the Emsland region are demanding that the German Minister of Economics, Robert Habeck, veto the planned joint venture, but he claims that the application has been withdrawn."

        "text": "After all, a cross-party group of MEPs tabled a resolution in the European Parliament at the end of February to call on EU member states to end all nuclear cooperation with Russia. Admittedly, in early April, all that was decided was that \"the use of services from Rosatom should be phased out.\" There is nothing to suggest that the EU Commission might back down from its historic misguided decision to include nuclear energy as \"sustainable\" in its taxonomy. Now it must take note that it is sustainability by Putin's grace."
