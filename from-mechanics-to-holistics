According to the mechanistic model, the whole is equal to the sum of its parts and therefore. we would expect a skin cell to contain all the information about itself, a hone cell to have information only about hone, and a blood cell to know only about blood. This is not the case. Every part, contains not only information about itself, but about every other factor constituting that entire body. Our skin cells contain information about our bones, our hair, our blood and every other part of us. That is, the genetic structure functions holistically."
