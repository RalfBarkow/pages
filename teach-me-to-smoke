Every detail must be explained to them by programmers, from the fact that you can't arbitrarily set the balance of someone else's bank account, to what to do when you can't open a file properly.  You must tell the program whether to tell the user to pick another file, give up, load a default template, or read an EOF and pretend that was the file.
