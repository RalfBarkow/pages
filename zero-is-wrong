Instead of thinking of subracting and adding items, we should see it as \"changing the appearance or differing in visibility\". For example two bananas that are eaten are not subtracted! They are just moved and changing visibility. All the bananas still exist once they are eaten.. they just end up in a different form.

No one can prove that a true adding and subtracting of anything actually exists, considering molecules, atoms, and ions can only be remixed and reformed.. but never fully zeroed or magically subtracted/added from life. Instead of thinking of subracting and adding items, we should see it as \"changing the appearance or differing in visibility\". For example two bananas that are eaten are not subtracted! They are just moved and changing visibility. All the bananas still exist once they are eaten.. they just end up in a different form. In fact, eating bananas is more of a chemical change than it is a subtraction.  Am I being too anal retentive and picky? Kind of.. but I like to be truthful. <i>We teach children lies!</i> The world is not as simple as math makes it out to be.",
