In recent years, the latter have aligned themselves according to entrepreneurial criteria in the interest of competition. The community of teachers and learners has also been torn apart by this. The digital phase illustrates this once again, without having conjured it up itself. Even if the call for an early restoration of presence is unmistakable, the crisis of teaching will not dissolve in such a call. Moreover, further covetousness has arisen on the part of the teachers and the university itself, which will be difficult to recapture. But students want at least one thing: on-site teaching as a social sounding board. It is not particularly reassuring, but it is probably a reality: demanding teaching formats that respect students as subjects are not even a prerequisite for this."
