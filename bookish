(Latex calls this the depth.) It took a while, but I figured out how to not only compute the depth below baseline but also how to get it back into this Java program via the latex log file. You can see how all of this is done here: [https://github.com/parrt/bookish/blob/master/src/us/parr/bookish/translate/Translator.java#L302 Translator.visitEqn()]."
