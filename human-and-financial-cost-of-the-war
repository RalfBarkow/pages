In all these areas, war, famine and disease inflicted severe losses on local populations- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years'_War#Human_and_financial_cost_of_the_war wikipedia]"

Since experience shows two to three times that number either died or were incapacitated by disease, that would suggest total military casualties ranged from 1.3 to 1.8 million dead or otherwise rendered unfit for service."

He concluded \"about 40% of the rural population fell victim to the war and epidemics; in the cities,...33%\". There were wide regional variations; in the [[Duchy of Württemberg]], the number of inhabitants fell by nearly 60%."
