He helps groups find zero-dollar solutions to million-dollar problems regarding facilities and furnishings as the world’s first and perhaps only furniture whisperer- capable of coaxing the best potential out of the unruliest school furnishing the world has on offer.  He is fortunate to be able to coach school leaders and educators in deeper learning practices where young people create evidence of their learning journeys and share them with the world."
