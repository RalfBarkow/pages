According to a survey, 59 percent of parents worry about the consequences of media use on their children's development. The media are also increasingly pointing out the risks of [[Screen Use]] for children and young people: It is increasingly common to read that excessive digital consumption leads to autism and hyperactivity in young children and makes teenagers addicted and violent. Raphaël Hitier spoke with renowned scientists and doctors to find out what is actually true about these hypotheses. He documents groundbreaking studies on the effects of media consumption on the brains of children and teenagers. Neurologists and addiction experts from the U.S., Sweden, France, China and Switzerland explain how cartoons, social networks and video games affect neural and psychological development. Is the digital generation really a sick generation?"
