DOI 10.1515/opis-2019-0006. \nAbstract\n            The new Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (ACRL, 2016) highlights the ability to synthesize ideas from multiple sources of information as one of the key knowledge practices. There is little generalizable empirical research based on cognitive science principles to guide information literacy instruction practice. The present study examined the effectiveness of elaborative interrogation instructional strategy on integration and transformation of ideas from multiple sources of information. 86 participants took part in the study via Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. The experiment involved reading five texts on the topic of climate change and responding to embedded elaborative interrogation prompts (treatment groups only), and writing a synthesis paragraph on the topic. Two one-way ANCOVAs were employed to test the hypotheses which indicated that elaborative interrogation prompts did not significantly improve performance on transformation and integration measures. This study contributes to the growing body of literature addressing information literacy instruction based on the new Framework and provides a promising long-term cross-disciplinary research partnership in terms of linking evidencebased guidance for instruction based on cognitive science principles to information literacy knowledge practices in the new Framework.\n\nFAROOQ, Omer and MAHER, Monica, 2021.

DOI 10.1002/acp.2350070306. \nAbstract\n            In two experiments, Canadian children in grades 6 and 7 processed facts about Canada and the U. S. under instructions to: (a) explain why the facts were true (elaborative interrogation); (b) read the facts with elaborations provided (provided elaborations); or (c) read the facts to remember (reading control). In Experiment 1, recall of Canadian facts was higher in the elaborative‐interrogation condition than in the elaboration‐provided condition. In Experiment 2 (Canadian and US facts), there were no significant differences in recall. Although only one comparison reached statistical significance, recall was descriptively greatest in the elaborative‐interrogation condition in both experiments with both Canadian and US facts. Across both experiments the average effect size of elaborative interrogation was 0.40 SD compared to the reading‐control and 0.56 SD compared to the elaboration‐provided condition. The quality of children’s explanation in the elaborative‐interrogation condition was related to probability of recall. Inclusion of prior knowledge in the children’s explanations was a better predictor of recall than was the adequacy of explanations.\n\nTEDJAATMADJA, Herwindy Maria and RENANDYA, Willy, 2012.

It may be, however, that both how information is organised and familiarity impact on the potency of the strategy.\n            Aims: We examined the influence of presentation structures (i.e., organisation of information) on the effectiveness of an elaboration strategy.\n            Samples: All participants were undergraduates (78 females, 67 males) enrolled in a first‐year psychology course. Fifteen students participated in Experiment One, 42 students in Experiment Two, and 88 students in Experiment Three.\n            Methods: In Experiment One, preference for conceptual organisation was assessed. In Experiments Two and Three, students answered ‘why’ questions when different presentation structures were used.\n            Results: Students’ preferred method of organisation did not match the imposed structure found in past research, suggesting that students may have been restricted in their ability to process the information distinctively. Students who were presented with the information in a random order achieved the largest memory scores.\n            Conclusions: When students have to reconstruct as well as encode the information, these added task demands provide an added benefit for learning.\n\nWILLOUGHBY, Teena, WOOD, Eileen, MCDERMOTT, Catherine and MCLAREN, Jennifer, 2000.

DOI 10.1002/acp.2350080104. \nAbstract\n            Previous studies have promoted the use of elaborative interrogation (a “why”‐questioning strategy) for the acquisition of factual information. One assumption in these studies is that prior knowledge influences when students will be able to use the strategy, with greater prior knowledge leading to higher recall performance. In the studies reviewed here, the effect of prior knowledge on strategy effectiveness was investigated. Specifically, students’ performances were compared for materials about which they possessed substantial prior knowledge, little prior knowledge, inconsistent prior knowledge, or shared prior knowledge. In general, the data support the use of elaborative interrogation when studying alone or in dyads especially when learners possess some relevant prior knowledge about the new information.\n\nWOLOSHYN, Vera Ella, 1991.

DOI 10.1515/opis-2019-0006. \nAbstract\n            The new Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (ACRL, 2016) highlights the ability to synthesize ideas from multiple sources of information as one of the key knowledge practices. There is little generalizable empirical research based on cognitive science principles to guide information literacy instruction practice. The present study examined the effectiveness of elaborative interrogation instructional strategy on integration and transformation of ideas from multiple sources of information. 86 participants took part in the study via Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. The experiment involved reading five texts on the topic of climate change and responding to embedded elaborative interrogation prompts (treatment groups only), and writing a synthesis paragraph on the topic. Two one-way ANCOVAs were employed to test the hypotheses which indicated that elaborative interrogation prompts did not significantly improve performance on transformation and integration measures. This study contributes to the growing body of literature addressing information literacy instruction based on the new Framework and provides a promising long-term cross-disciplinary research partnership in terms of linking evidencebased guidance for instruction based on cognitive science principles to information literacy knowledge practices in the new Framework.\n\nFAROOQ, Omer and MAHER, Monica, 2021.

S. under instructions to: (a) explain why the facts were true (elaborative interrogation); (b) read the facts with elaborations provided (provided elaborations); or (c) read the facts to remember (reading control). In Experiment 1, recall of Canadian facts was higher in the elaborative‐interrogation condition than in the elaboration‐provided condition. In Experiment 2 (Canadian and US facts), there were no significant differences in recall. Although only one comparison reached statistical significance, recall was descriptively greatest in the elaborative‐interrogation condition in both experiments with both Canadian and US facts. Across both experiments the average effect size of elaborative interrogation was 0.40 SD compared to the reading‐control and 0.56 SD compared to the elaboration‐provided condition. The quality of children’s explanation in the elaborative‐interrogation condition was related to probability of recall. Inclusion of prior knowledge in the children’s explanations was a better predictor of recall than was the adequacy of explanations.\n\nTEDJAATMADJA, Herwindy Maria and RENANDYA, Willy, 2012.

DOI 10.1348/000709903762869914. \nBackground: Researchers examining the effectiveness of an elaboration strategy (answering ‘why’) for learning new information have been concerned with the familiarity of the materials and how that affects learning. It may be, however, that both how information is organised and familiarity impact on the potency of the strategy.\n            Aims: We examined the influence of presentation structures (i.e., organisation of information) on the effectiveness of an elaboration strategy.\n            Samples: All participants were undergraduates (78 females, 67 males) enrolled in a first‐year psychology course. Fifteen students participated in Experiment One, 42 students in Experiment Two, and 88 students in Experiment Three.\n            Methods: In Experiment One, preference for conceptual organisation was assessed. In Experiments Two and Three, students answered ‘why’ questions when different presentation structures were used.\n            Results: Students’ preferred method of organisation did not match the imposed structure found in past research, suggesting that students may have been restricted in their ability to process the information distinctively. Students who were presented with the information in a random order achieved the largest memory scores.\n            Conclusions: When students have to reconstruct as well as encode the information, these added task demands provide an added benefit for learning.\n\nWILLOUGHBY, Teena, WOOD, Eileen, MCDERMOTT, Catherine and MCLAREN, Jennifer, 2000.

DOI 10.1002/acp.2350080104. \nAbstract\n            Previous studies have promoted the use of elaborative interrogation (a “why”‐questioning strategy) for the acquisition of factual information. One assumption in these studies is that prior knowledge influences when students will be able to use the strategy, with greater prior knowledge leading to higher recall performance. In the studies reviewed here, the effect of prior knowledge on strategy effectiveness was investigated. Specifically, students’ performances were compared for materials about which they possessed substantial prior knowledge, little prior knowledge, inconsistent prior knowledge, or shared prior knowledge. In general, the data support the use of elaborative interrogation when studying alone or in dyads especially when learners possess some relevant prior knowledge about the new information.\n\nWOLOSHYN, Vera Ella, 1991.
