However, the structure, the beauty aesthetics simplicity clarity and expressiveness of the source code is \"obviously\" part of the secondary goal - setting up for the next game. If you know there's no next game, write the crap and publish it and chuck the source as fast as possible. If you know there'll be a second game, attend to the cost of revisiting the code. If you're not sure, hedge your bet in whichever way you feel up to (\"ya rolls yer dice and ya takes yer chances\") -- [[Alistair Cockburn]]",
