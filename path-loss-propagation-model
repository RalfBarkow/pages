The mentioned groups of the propagation model had contributed to the successful estimation of signal propagation loss for effective design of wireless communication systems. Among the numerous path loss models that exit, the empirical path loss propagation models have been widely used to predict the behavior of radio signals as they propagate throughout a particular environment and location. These models have enjoyed much attention from researchers because of their ease of use and simplicity, and the implementation of these empirical models requires less computational efforts. However, they failed to fully take into consideration the physical composition of the target environment, making them vulnerable to high prediction errors when applied in an environment different from which it was built for [4]."

      "text": "Their inability in getting detailed information about the propagating environment leads to the adoption of intelligent algorithms to predict path loss, including the artificial neural networks (ANNs) and fuzzy systems (FSs). These methods learn and adapt to any changes in the environment, thus providing a better prediction when compared with the traditional models. Nature-inspired computational methodologies, also known as computational intelligent (CI), such as the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and ant colony (AC), provide a solution to the complex propagation environments where the traditional models failed [5]. In particular, these CI methods integrate neural networks, fuzzy logic, and other natural inspired algorithms to optimize the path loss, thus reducing the errors and improving the prediction accuracy."
