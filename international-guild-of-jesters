In [[Diego Velázquez]]'s painting [[Las Meninas]] two dwarfs are included: [[Maria Bárbola]], a female dwarf from [[Germany]] with [[hydrocephalus]], and [[:es:Nicolasito Pertusato]] from [[Italy]]. Mari Bárbola can also be seen in a later portrait of [[Margarita Teresa of Spain]] in mourning by [[Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo]]. There are other paintings by Velázquez that include court dwarves such as [[Prince Balthasar Charles With a Dwarf]]."
