Whereas the importance of computers as research tools is evident to everyone, the impact of the digital revolution on the representation of scientific knowledge is not yet widely recognized. An ever increasing part of today’s scientific knowledge is expressed, published, and archived exclusively in the form of software and electronic datasets. In this essay, I compare these digital scientific notations to the the traditional scientific notations that have been used for centuries, showing how the digital notations optimized for computerized processing are often an obstacle to scientific communication and to creative work by human scientists. I analyze the causes and propose guidelines for the design of more human-friendly digital scientific notations."

Whereas the importance of computers as research tools is evident to everyone, the impact of the digital revolution on the representation of scientific knowledge is not yet widely recognized. An ever increasing part of today’s scientific knowledge is expressed, published, and archived exclusively in the form of software and electronic datasets. In this essay, I compare these digital scientific notations to the the traditional scientific notations that have been used for centuries, showing how the digital notations optimized for computerized processing are often an obstacle to scientific communication and to creative work by human scientists. I analyze the causes and propose guidelines for the design of more human-friendly digital scientific notations."

In other words, every four lines end in one of the following formats: AABB, ABAB, or ABBA. Additionally, rhyming line pairs will match in meter. In other words, when two lines share meter when the lines have the same number of syllables. Meter also encompasses the arrangement of stressed and unstressed syllables."

While it is true that there have been some attempts to reproduce the model's capabilities by other researchers and organizations, it is not accurate to say that all of these attempts have failed.\n\nIt is important to note that GPT-3 is a highly complex and resource-intensive model that requires significant computational power and expertise to develop and train. Therefore, reproducing its capabilities is a challenging task that may not be feasible for many organizations.\n\nThat being said, there have been some successful attempts to reproduce GPT-3's capabilities to some extent, with varying degrees of accuracy and effectiveness. For example, there have been several open-source models and projects that aim to replicate some of GPT-3's capabilities, such as Hugging Face's \"Transformers\" library and EleutherAI's \"GPT-Neo\" models. While these models may not match the exact performance and capabilities of GPT-3, they do represent important progress in the field of natural language processing and show that it is possible to build powerful language models outside of OpenAI's research team.\n\n\n"

Under this criteria, GPT-3 and PaLM (540B) are successful, but both of the models are not public, while all of the public models (e.g. OPT-175B, and BLOOM-176B) are “failures”, to some extent. But still, we can learn many lessons from such “failures”. Note that if we have tried different settings for many times, the public community could probably eventually reproduce GPT-3. But till now, the expense is still too high to train even another version of OPT-175B. Because training one pass of such a large model requires running at least for 2 months on ~1000 80G A100 GPUs."
