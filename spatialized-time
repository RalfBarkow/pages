The predominant notion seems to be the essentially spatial notion of an encompassing time that surrounds the precisely defined area of daily life from the [[Outside]]. It is a notion that involves neither transcendence nor reference to an otherworldly dimension, although it presupposes a cosmology that includes the (temporally and spatially) absent – and therefore has a stability beyond the ongoing event. The distinctions with which this notion of time is expressed are themselves spatial. First and foremost, it is the proximity/distance distinction that separates a familiar realm, which includes the past that one remembers and a future that one can control through present behavior, from an unfamiliar realm that is lost in an indeterminable distance. A similar structure can be found in the ancient Egyptian distinction between this world and the other world or in the Mesopotamian distinction between that which is in front (the past) and that which remains behind (the future).\n"

Although it is not absolutely unlimited in the abstract, this limit can never be reached. The hereafter is neither nothingness nor a transcendent realm, but it is nevertheless something that remains hidden, a \"natural mystery\". Underlying the distinctions that constitute time is the open/hidden distinction, which expresses the relationship between the present and the realm of the absent – an immanent, always intangible, uncertain and essentially threatening realm."

The debate about languages that supposedly do not have time – and the associated peoples, among whom the Hopi Indians researched by Whorf should be mentioned first and foremost – is well known. Subsequent research has shown that in reality only one [[Autonomous Dimension of Time]] is missing and not the ability to refer to distinctions of the kind before/after. In the languages of the peoples in question, the temporal categories are expressed by aspect-related distinctions such as continuous/interrupted, perfective/imperfective, punctual/continuous, inchoative/resultative, and so on. Distinctions of this kind are also found in more abstract semantics associated with languages whose verb systems realize a combination of aspect and \"tense\" (the past/future distinction). They therefore have verb forms such as the Italian imperfect, the English continuous form, the gerund, the inchoative and resultative forms of the Slavic languages and many others that do not denote a past or future tense, but distinctions of a different kind. Both the imperfect and the perfect are past forms, but the imperfect expresses the continuity of an action, as does the \"-ing\" form in English in all three time dimensions or the French constructions of the type \"etre en train de...\". Other forms, especially in the rich aspect system of Slavic languages, express the fact that an action is started or finished or leads to a result. Another example is the past tense in many European languages. The difference compared to languages without an alphabet therefore does not correspond to the tense/aspect distinction, but rather relates to the fact that the latter apparently do not know any autonomous distinctions from tense."

They therefore have verb forms such as the Italian imperfect, the English continuous form, the gerund, the inchoative and resultative forms of the Slavic languages and many others that do not denote a past or future tense, but distinctions of a different kind. Both the imperfect and the perfect are past forms, but the imperfect expresses the continuity of an action, as does the \"-ing\" form in English in all three time dimensions or the French constructions of the type \"etre en train de...\". Other forms, especially in the rich aspect system of Slavic languages, express the fact that an action is started or finished or leads to a result. Another example is the past tense in many European languages. The difference compared to languages without an alphabet therefore does not correspond to the re-rrs/aspect distinction, but rather relates to the fact that the latter apparently do not know any autonomous distinctions from tense."

        "text": "In these circumstances, only temporal distinctions such as the past/future distinction are missing: a semantic peculiarity that can be assumed to be reflected in the lexical system of spoken languages in scriptless societies (and vice versa). The debate about languages that supposedly do not have time – and the associated peoples, among whom the Hopi Indians researched by Whorf should be mentioned first and foremost – is well known. Subsequent research has shown that in reality only one [[Autonomous Dimension of Time]] is missing and not the ability to refer to distinctions of the kind before/after. In the languages of the peoples in question, the temporal categories are expressed by aspect-related distinctions such as continuous/interrupted, perfective/imperfective, punctual/continuous, inchoative/resultative, and so on. Distinctions of this kind are also found in more abstract semantics associated with languages whose verb systems realize a combination of aspect and \"tense\" (the past/future distinction). They therefore have verb forms such as the Italian imperfect, the English continuous form, the gerund, the inchoative and resultative forms of the Slavic languages and many others that do not denote a past or future tense, but distinctions of a different kind.
