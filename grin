([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PÃ©ter_Gervai wikipedia on me])\n\nI have started learning programming with a [[ZX-81]] stenciled illegal manual, a math notepad, and without any computer. In a few months (and after a lot of BASIC programs on paper) I met with a real ZX81 (which was later upgraded to the way more state-of-the-art ZX81 + 1 kb RAM extender!). Had a [[Commodore VIC-20]] for a while. Then a [[Commodore 116]]. \n\nIn the meantime I won an [[Enterprise 128]] on a programming contest, then it was gone, too."
