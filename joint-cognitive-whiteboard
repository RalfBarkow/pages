A group of software engineers gathered around a whiteboard are a joint cognitive system. The scrawls on the board are spatial cues for building a shared model of a complex system.\n\nMy co-workers and I were wrestling with an authentication problem... we're implementing a thing that'll run in a browser and go through graphql queries to get to a few different internal apis. Authentication is always difficult. This problem is complicated by options about which domain names we use for the different components (because identity starts with cookies in browsers & browser security depends on domain-certificate pairs, among other things), where the name spaces are under different administrative domains (different teams control the different names), different teams control different apis."
