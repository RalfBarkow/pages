It’s called ‘orientation attention’, and it operates quickly, saving energy, as the brain is not required to develop a full understanding of your surroundings.\n\nThe other system is called ‘discover attention’. This operates more slowly, as the brain collects information from our memory to obtain a full understanding of the scene.\n\nAn example of the two systems in operation can be seen when you walk down the street. The orientation system allows you to easily move in and out of the path of other people, and stops you from falling over or walking into a lamppost. But when your eye catches sight of something interesting in a shop window, you switch over to the discover system to get the full picture.\n\nThe object you’re looking at might seem familiar, but has a different shape or colour. How long you spend looking at the object, depends on how much sense it makes to you and the number of other things you’re thinking about at that time.
