Variable names aren't comments. If you think the variable needs more than the name you call it, then put the extra description in a comment. Why is it that almost all Mathematical formulas just use a, b, c or x, y, and z as variable names? Because the point is the relationship between them rather than what they are. Sometimes a table is given to explain what each of the variables mean. Almost all variables are local to a function, a table or an object. In all those cases, you only have to have unique names within that scope which doesn't require more than a single word. The more typing you do, the more chance of spelling the variable wrong. Long variable names also detract from the readability of a program and the longer names, in general, don't add any more explicit meaning than smaller variable names. I think there is a place for 1 character variable names but I am mostly saying that variables should be 1 word in size. I don't believe for 1 second that large variable names make debugging code easier. It is just not true. Having a good data dictionary and reusing the same variable names in different contexts makes program code easier to work with and less error prone. Encoding the variable type as a postfix or prefix of the variable name is also bad. If you don't know what type of variable it is <i>don't touch it</i>. -- [[David Clarkd]]",

Variable names aren't comments. If you think the variable needs more than the name you call it, then put the extra description in a comment. Why is it that almost all Mathematical formulas just use a, b, c or x, y, and z as variable names? Because the point is the relationship between them rather than what they are. Sometimes a table is given to explain what each of the variables mean. Almost all variables are local to a function, a table or an object. In all those cases, you only have to have unique names within that scope which doesn't require more than a single word. The more typing you do, the more chance of spelling the variable wrong. Long variable names also detract from the readability of a program and the longer names, in general, don't add any more explicit meaning than smaller variable names. I think there is a place for 1 character variable names but I am mostly saying that variables should be 1 word in size. I don't believe for 1 second that large variable names make debugging code easier. It is just not true. Having a good data dictionary and reusing the same variable names in different contexts makes program code easier to work with and less error prone. Encoding the variable type as a postfix or prefix of the variable name is also bad. If you don't know what type of variable it is <i>don't touch it</i>. -- [[David Clarkd]]",
