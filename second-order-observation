That means that what we articulate about the ‘observations’ as objects of our study also applies to the articulation itself. Second-order observation is simultaneously first-order observation, and takes place, therefore, within the framework of a difference. Thus, it is not a privileged position of observation, poised above other observations. The conditions that apply to first-order observation apply to second-order observations as well. The theory of observation encompasses itself, so to speak. The difference through which second-order observation observes is the difference indication/difference. Therefore, an observation can be formalized as the unity of the difference (see Figure 1.2)."
