If you look at the television set (by typing \"look tv\"), you might see that it has dials and an antenna, and that you can turn it on by typing \"turn on tv\". However, if you type \"@list tv:\"turn\", you see <i>the code</i> for that verb. In fact, if you type \"@dump tv\", you see the code for the entire object. Supposing you are the owner of the TV, you can invoke an editor on the spot and immediately change its code, or add new verbs (\"smash tv\"). As soon as you commit your code changes, the behavior of the object is updated. Meanwhile, 100+ other users are milling about chatting, playing with objects, and creating new objects, all through textual commands like \"look at jessica\", \"wave jessica\", \"take robot from bookcase\", \"throw robot at xie\", etc. However, <i>everything</i> on the MOO is implemented as an object in the VR database, including rooms, doors, players, pez, the sky, and so on. The owners of those objects can alter them at will, and essential objects, such as the generic player class that everyone inherits from, are owned by the equivalent of \"root\". In fact, the MOO server itself implements a small VM, complete with cooperative multitasking and the equivalent of a database, and the verbs on objects are programmed in a [[Java Script]]-esque language. Like Smalltalk code, MOO code doesn't make too much sense in isolation, since all MOO objects inherit from other objects, and a verb on a given object almost always calls verbs on other objects in order to do things. For example, if the TV blares out a message when it turns on, the code might look like \"if(!this.on) { player:tell(\"The TV blares, 'News at 11.'\"); }\", where \"tell\" is a verb on the player who turned it on. Even the code that processes user logins is in-MOO; the MOO server itself only establishes the network connections. Thus, it is possible to completely change the way the MOO authenticates users without patching the server. There is also no law that says a MOO has to have any \"rooms\" -- it's conceivable that MOO could be used as a shell for a web RPG or as a means of cataloguing zoo animals.",

If you look at the television set (by typing \"look tv\"), you might see that it has dials and an antenna, and that you can turn it on by typing \"turn on tv\". However, if you type \"@list tv:\"turn\", you see <i>the code</i> for that verb. In fact, if you type \"@dump tv\", you see the code for the entire object. Supposing you are the owner of the TV, you can invoke an editor on the spot and immediately change its code, or add new verbs (\"smash tv\"). As soon as you commit your code changes, the behavior of the object is updated. Meanwhile, 100+ other users are milling about chatting, playing with objects, and creating new objects, all through textual commands like \"look at jessica\", \"wave jessica\", \"take robot from bookcase\", \"throw robot at xie\", etc. However, <i>everything</i> on the MOO is implemented as an object in the VR database, including rooms, doors, players, pez, the sky, and so on. The owners of those objects can alter them at will, and essential objects, such as the generic player class that everyone inherits from, are owned by the equivalent of \"root\". In fact, the MOO server itself implements a small VM, complete with cooperative multitasking and the equivalent of a database, and the verbs on objects are programmed in a [[Java Script]]-esque language. Like Smalltalk code, MOO code doesn't make too much sense in isolation, since all MOO objects inherit from other objects, and a verb on a given object almost always calls verbs on other objects in order to do things. For example, if the TV blares out a message when it turns on, the code might look like \"if(!this.on) { player:tell(\"The TV blares, 'News at 11.'\"); }\", where \"tell\" is a verb on the player who turned it on. Even the code that processes user logins is in-MOO; the MOO server itself only establishes the network connections. Thus, it is possible to completely change the way the MOO authenticates users without patching the server. There is also no law that says a MOO has to have any \"rooms\" -- it's conceivable that MOO could be used as a shell for a web RPG or as a means of cataloguing zoo animals.",

The reason [[Open Croquet]] seems to have been hard for the people posting above to understand is because it's so abstract. It's a framework for building cooperative, 3D spaces. Theoretically, you could reimplement Second Life on top of Croquet, or rather, multiple [[Second Life]]s that could talk to each other. ",
