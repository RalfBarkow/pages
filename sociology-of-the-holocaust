        "text": "[…] Der moderne Genozid verfolgt ein höheres Ziel. Die Beseitigung des Gegners ist ein Mittel zum Zweck, eine Notwendigkeit, die sich aus der übergeordneten Zielsetzung ergibt: Dieses Ziel ist die Vision einer besseren, von Grund auf gewandelten Gesellschaft. Der moderne Genozid ist ein Element des »Social Engineering«, mit dem eine soziale Ordnung realisiert werden soll, die dem Entwurf einer perfekten Gesellschaft entspricht. Die Planer und Lenker des modernen Genozids fassen die Gesellschaft als Objekt zielstrebiger Vorausberechnung auf, das mehr als isolierte gestalterische Eingriffe und Reparaturen erfordert. Das Ziel ist ehrgeiziger und radikaler: Es gilt, die Gesellschaft neu zu erschaffen, um sie in ein übergreifendes, an wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen orientiertes Schema zu zwingen. Eine neue Gesellschaft soll entstehen, die ihrem »dahinvegetierenden« Pendant »objektiv« überlegen ist. Natürlich hat dieser Gesellschaftsentwurf eine ästhetische Dimension - die bevorstehende ideale Welt kann nur am Maßstab des Schönen an sich gemessen werden. Eine neue Welt, die einem perfekten Kunstwerk gleicht, das (...) weder durch Hinzufügen, durch Weglassen noch durch Ändern verbessert werden kann« (Bauman, a.a.O., $.106). Ein Handeln in diesem Sinne orientiert sich an Abstraktionen, an Idealen, die es so in der Realität gar nicht gibt, an Vorstellungen, wie sie ihre höchste Ausprägung in den Denkfiguren abendländischer Wissenschaft erfahren haben."
