There continues to be much fighting over who controls this role.  To me it is clear that this role must be an integral part of neighborhoods themselves. Adoption of this role in neighborhoods would have made practicing medicine much more emotionally rewarding and less frustrating for doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. It would have saved Medicare billions of dollars over 15 years in my county alone. It was simple to understand and simple to implement. \n"
