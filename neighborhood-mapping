Without a graph visualization tool (nodes and connections) we cannot share and  understand complex systems. Without a GIS tool we cannot visualize where the systems components are located nor their geographic patterns of interactions. Without a property graph database we cannot afford the cost of writing queries to discover patterns in the data.\nBetter results: We can't pursue different outcomes if we can't see alternative routes. Routes are paths between places and things. We easily see facilities and buildings—things. We naturally think about entities: people, groups, and businesses.\nIn this project we begin to add, to literally draw in, the relationships—real connections as well as needed as yet missing connections. Once we have added a relationship we can add properties to the relationship, to put some flesh on it. Then we find or create pathways–linked parts--connections, that get us to our goals.\nDEVELOPING A TRANSFORMATIVE INSTRUMENT\nWe are building a 21st Century equivalent of Leeuwenhoek's microscope, in this case a socio-scope, that allows us to see what is normally invisible to us—the collective us. We are highlighting the relationships between us. In Leeuwenhoek's case it was a matter of seeing things that were too small for an unaided eye. In our case it's seeing relationships--dynamic, changing, \"abstract\", relationships that move and transform things. Relationships (connections) provide information, provide motive power, provide money, etc. We surface the pathways for people, projects, and things to be transformed–moved, changed, rearranged, improved. \nSELF-ORGANIZING (ORGANIZE, OR BE ORGANIZED)\nTraditionally, we deal with one another through stories and sometimes we create specialized drawings of our stories—graphs. We draw pictures of  things connected with lines, indicating relationships and therefore change. Our “relational” database technology has been really bad at representing complex relationships—complex sets of changing connections among things. Until recently, our best attempts at representing changing relationships have been difficult to visualize and efforts have often been proprietary and not shared beyond the walls of the enterprise. Our future will be determined by enterprises of enterprises; furthermore, self-organizing enterprises of enterprises.

We want self-organizing to have an at least equal likelihood of success as does top-down, hierarchical organizing. Command and control style hierarchies may provide tight control but at the cost of limited diversity and creative potential. Robust networks have greater potential for diversity and creativity but can dissolve in confusion and non-aligned effort. Once we know the secrete to network design and to subnetwork viability we are set to perform an interesting balancing act—democracy / autocracy and self-control / being controlled. We can move beyond the difficult compromise, commonly brokered with money: ‘your freedom for my money’—kind of soft gun to our heads.\nPurposeful self-organizing usually happens only when the relationships are understood or at least discoverable. We are going to begin representing relevant neighborhood and community purposes and relationships in ways that are understandable and public.\nThe goal is to enable self organizing at all scales within a county or region. BUT neighborhood self-organizing is understood to be primary simply because life is experienced and lived in neighborhoods where we face one another.\nSTAGES AND PHASES\nThis new platform's functionality will unfold in three stages:\n1) visual tools for discovery and diagnosis,\n2) visual tools for design and development, and\n3) visual tools for managing and operating day-to-day.\nTECHNOLOGY\nWe will use iterative design and deployment to allow the platform to evolve with our users–so that it is useful and used at every stage of development.

We could also partner with Vera Institute and help with Criminal Justice Reform—de-incarcerations the population safely. There are 117 Cooperative Community Banks in Brazil that are interested as well.\nTRANSATLANTIC—INVITING MALIK TO SHARE\nAfter getting the Linkage Map visualization platform stable and in use, we will begin development of the diagnosis, design, and operations functions. The transition from visualizing previously invisible parts and relationships of networks to diagnostics will be the development of a Viable System Model capability–the ability for purposeful actors to determine whether their shared venture can succeed over time (viability, sustainability). Once an on-line survey with VSM visualization exists and is used, programs, projects or businesses could be further explored with Malik methods and tools (Beer’s VSM, Vester’s Sensitivity Model, Beer and Leonard’s Syntigration) as needed. Of course any other network analysis and visualization tools are potentially available, based upon the fact that Neo4j, a \"property graph data base\" is the underlying data base. The importance of Malik tools is their ability to make social sense of massive complexity that is inherent in neighborhoods and communities and between institutions. One of the critical needs is to discover the leverage points in dynamic networks and answer some critical questions about the system: What can really change things for the better? What will likely make things worse? What is too dangerous to mess with? What will resist any attempt to change it? What is inherently unstable? Vester’s Sensitivity Model helps us surface these answers elegantly.\n\n####TURNING THE LIGHTS ON\nWe can't see the things that affect our health and our businesses the most.\nOur attention tends to go toward the things we can see. The common expression \"our focus\" is clearly a visual metaphor. If the things that make the most difference are frequently invisible, so it is important to make them visible. That's what linkage mapping does.\nMost humans are comfortable juggling 3 to 7 things at a time. The world that effects our businesses and our lives is much larger than that. One of the challenges we have is making the large network of relationships manageable.\nOur customers and clients often depend on the interactions beyond our individual businesses. Customers, clients, and suppliers prefer to work with those who can manage the necessary web of relationships.\nThis network or web must be able to manage the flow of people, materials, and information between institutions and individuals. We must be able to see the usually invisible connections and we must be able to manage them. Also purposes must be identified  which guide the parts of the web to navigate and to self-organize.\nPROCESSES AND POLITICS \nIn addition to these obvious and mechanical flows there is the aspect of networks that make them look and act a lot more like a family or a garden than a machine. Machine-like relationships need to be dealt with mechanically and family-like relationships require a different approach. So our problem-solving will fall into two broad categories: processes and politics. Processes turn on mechanics, politics turn on purposes. Ultimately our map of connections needs to be able to represent both processes and purpose determined networks. There are food networks. There are education networks. There are health networks. There are justice networks and incarceration networks. Purpose is the center or the defining and driving force of dynamic social networks. State the purpose, draw the network—make it visible. Make its structure viable. Make it more effective. Make it more efficient. Purposeful, visible, viable, effective, efficient—in that order, with those nesting priorities.\nWe must not continue like the man looking for his keys in the lamp light when he actually drop them in the dark. We must shed light on the hidden parts and relationship to find our cherished futures.\nThis now visible network of relationships must be able to accommodate process improvement and lean methods, political negotiations, and customer navigation.\nThese networks must be displayed on recognizable geographical maps. They must be able to show the status of relationships programs projects and processes. Sectors networks, such as education, health and justice present some of the most powerful opportunity for innovations. Beyond that, there will be linkages across sector boundaries.\nSURVEYS\nThe platform must be able to integrate survey data with the network and display it visually on maps.\nGEOSPATIAL MAPS—FOR UNDERSTANDING AND NAVIGATING\nIt must be able to accommodate geographical maps, logic maps, and process maps.\nThe platform must be able to display relevant connections for any user. A mother would likely have different connections than a hospital CEO or an insurance company CEO.\nIn the final analysis these are navigation maps, to trace your path through a maze. Also so we can design new paths. They provide the information so that one can navigate whatever level or layer of the map that's relevant to your purpose.\nSimply put, those that can manage networks in support of customers needs will survive and those that cannot will go out of business. In a massively connected world, visualizing and managing relationships between institutions is the difference between survival and failure. It is a very good survival tool and strategy. Being overwhelmed by the number of connections, by complexity, is not a good survival strategy. There is a middle way.\nThe best methodology and the political skills in the world can't help if you haven't seen the critical connections. Going forward, what you don't see will kill you. Strategies for interaction will produce better results than isolation and protectionism.\nThese maps let you see the missing opportunities and have those missing conversation. They dramatically expand the playing field and those who can step onto that field and up to that challenge will win. Once you have a shared connection map and a few new skills you can navigate complexity and create meaningful patterns out of chaos. This approach will be less frustrating, more interesting, and more profitable.\n####TOOLS FOR COMMUNITY ORGANIZING, PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT\nCommunity level linkage maps are a critical navigation, planning, and strategic prioritization tools for all wellbeing related institutions in the community or region. Selected strategies can be depicted on the linkage map and tactics can even be followed and monitored or superimposed on the linkage map. Any particular institution can see the opportunities, threats and potential partnerships on this map and can therefore create their strategic plans from it.\n\nShared Feb. 9, 2019 by\n_Author: Marc Pierson, protected by Community Commons—Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_\n(img)\n"

Once we have added a relationship we can add properties to the relationship, to put some flesh on it. Then we find or create pathways–linked parts--connections, that get us to our goals.\nDEVELOPING A TRANSFORMATIVE INSTRUMENT\nWe are building a 21st Century equivalent of Leeuwenhoek's microscope, in this case a socio-scope, that allows us to see what is normally invisible to us—the collective us. We are highlighting the relationships between us. In Leeuwenhoek's case it was a matter of seeing things that were too small for an unaided eye. In our case it's seeing relationships--dynamic, changing, \"abstract\", relationships that move and transform things. Relationships (connections) provide information, provide motive power, provide money, etc. We surface the pathways for people, projects, and things to be transformed–moved, changed, rearranged, improved. \nSELF-ORGANIZING (ORGANIZE, OR BE ORGANIZED)\nTraditionally, we deal with one another through stories and sometimes we create specialized drawings of our stories—graphs. We draw pictures of  things connected with lines, indicating relationships and therefore change. Our “relational” database technology has been really bad at representing complex relationships—complex sets of changing connections among things. Until recently, our best attempts at representing changing relationships have been difficult to visualize and efforts have often been proprietary and not shared beyond the walls of the enterprise. Our future will be determined by enterprises of enterprises; furthermore, self-organizing enterprises of enterprises. Our key purpose here is to make self-organizing easy—at any scale, but particularly at local scale. We want self-organizing to have an at least equal likelihood of success as does top-down, hierarchical organizing. Command and control style hierarchies may provide tight control but at the cost of limited diversity and creative potential. Robust networks have greater potential for diversity and creativity but can dissolve in confusion and non-aligned effort. Once we know the secrete to network design and to subnetwork viability we are set to perform an interesting balancing act—democracy / autocracy and self-control / being controlled. We can move beyond the difficult compromise, commonly brokered with money: ‘your freedom for my money’—kind of soft gun to our heads.\nPurposeful self-organizing usually happens only when the relationships are understood or at least discoverable. We are going to begin representing relevant neighborhood and community purposes and relationships in ways that are understandable and public.\nThe goal is to enable self organizing at all scales within a county or region. BUT neighborhood self-organizing is understood to be primary simply because life is experienced and lived in neighborhoods where we face one another.\nSTAGES AND PHASES\nThis new platform's functionality will unfold in three stages:\n1) visual tools for discovery and diagnosis,\n2) visual tools for design and development, and\n3) visual tools for managing and operating day-to-day.\nTECHNOLOGY\nWe will use iterative design and deployment to allow the platform to evolve with our users–so that it is useful and used at every stage of development. (SCRUM--Agile methods). Scrum and commitment based management are built into our approach. This very document is written in the largest Scrum-Agile platform on earth—Atlasian’s Confluence and Jira.\nMy initial goal (for the discovery and diagnostic phase) is to create a Geospatial Linkage Map Platform and use it for a single region--Whatcom County, WA (Once operational I will add other regions as they show interest.\nAfter looking at KeyLines, Linkurious, and Tom Sawyer Perspectives for as the front end and APIs, I have concluded that Tom Sawyer Perspectives is the most versatile and best suited to satisfy a diverse set of end users. We will begin with a hosted instance of Neo4j Enterprise. We will start the web hosting from my http://community4health.com/ WordPress site. We will use Atlasssian's Confluence and JIRA to manage communication and development efforts.\nI will begin by creating Excel or Google Sheets CVS files for key entities and relationships in Whatcom County, to include the program participants involved with all the local foundations, the public health department, the school districts, and importantly the Bellingham Neighborhood Associations.

        "text": "####TURNING THE LIGHTS ON\nWe can't see the things that affect our health and our businesses the most.\nOur attention tends to go toward the things we can see. The common expression \"our focus\" is clearly a visual metaphor. If the things that make the most difference are frequently invisible, so it is important to make them visible. That's what linkage mapping does.\nMost humans are comfortable juggling 3 to 7 things at a time. The world that effects our businesses and our lives is much larger than that. One of the challenges we have is making the large network of relationships manageable.\nOur customers and clients often depend on the interactions beyond our individual businesses. Customers, clients, and suppliers prefer to work with those who can manage the necessary web of relationships.\nThis network or web must be able to manage the flow of people, materials, and information between institutions and individuals. We must be able to see the usually invisible connections and we must be able to manage them. Also purposes must be identified  which guide the parts of the web to navigate and to self-organize.\nPROCESSES AND POLITICS \nIn addition to these obvious and mechanical flows there is the aspect of networks that make them look and act a lot more like a family or a garden than a machine. Machine-like relationships need to be dealt with mechanically and family-like relationships require a different approach. So our problem-solving will fall into two broad categories: processes and politics. Processes turn on mechanics, politics turn on purposes. Ultimately our map of connections needs to be able to represent both processes and purpose determined networks. There are food networks. There are education networks. There are health networks. There are justice networks and incarceration networks. Purpose is the center or the defining and driving force of dynamic social networks. State the purpose, draw the network—make it visible. Make its structure viable. Make it more effective. Make it more efficient. Purposeful, visible, viable, effective, efficient—in that order, with those nesting priorities.\nWe must not continue like the man looking for his keys in the lamp light when he actually drop them in the dark. We must shed light on the hidden parts and relationship to find our cherished futures.\nThis now visible network of relationships must be able to accommodate process improvement and lean methods, political negotiations, and customer navigation.\nThese networks must be displayed on recognizable geographical maps. They must be able to show the status of relationships programs projects and processes. Sectors networks, such as education, health and justice present some of the most powerful opportunity for innovations. Beyond that, there will be linkages across sector boundaries.\nSURVEYS\nThe platform must be able to integrate survey data with the network and display it visually on maps.\nGEOSPATIAL MAPS—FOR UNDERSTANDING AND NAVIGATING\nIt must be able to accommodate geographical maps, logic maps, and process maps.\nThe platform must be able to display relevant connections for any user. A mother would likely have different connections than a hospital CEO or an insurance company CEO.\nIn the final analysis these are navigation maps, to trace your path through a maze. Also so we can design new paths. They provide the information so that one can navigate whatever level or layer of the map that's relevant to your purpose.\nSimply put, those that can manage networks in support of customers needs will survive and those that cannot will go out of business. In a massively connected world, visualizing and managing relationships between institutions is the difference between survival and failure. It is a very good survival tool and strategy. Being overwhelmed by the number of connections, by complexity, is not a good survival strategy. There is a middle way.\nThe best methodology and the political skills in the world can't help if you haven't seen the critical connections. Going forward, what you don't see will kill you. Strategies for interaction will produce better results than isolation and protectionism.\nThese maps let you see the missing opportunities and have those missing conversation. They dramatically expand the playing field and those who can step onto that field and up to that challenge will win. Once you have a shared connection map and a few new skills you can navigate complexity and create meaningful patterns out of chaos. This approach will be less frustrating, more interesting, and more profitable.\n####TOOLS FOR COMMUNITY ORGANIZING, PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT\nCommunity level linkage maps are a critical navigation, planning, and strategic prioritization tools for all wellbeing related institutions in the community or region. Selected strategies can be depicted on the linkage map and tactics can even be followed and monitored or superimposed on the linkage map. Any particular institution can see the opportunities, threats and potential partnerships on this map and can therefore create their strategic plans from it.\n\nShared Feb. 9, 2019 by\n_Author: Marc Pierson, protected by Community Commons—Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_\n(img)\n"

The common expression \"our focus\" is clearly a visual metaphor. If the things that make the most difference are frequently invisible, so it is important to make them visible. That's what linkage mapping does.\nMost humans are comfortable juggling 3 to 7 things at a time. The world that effects our businesses and our lives is much larger than that. One of the challenges we have is making the large network of relationships manageable.\nOur customers and clients often depend on the interactions beyond our individual businesses. Customers, clients, and suppliers prefer to work with those who can manage the necessary web of relationships.\nThis network or web must be able to manage the flow of people, materials, and information between institutions and individuals. We must be able to see the usually invisible connections and we must be able to manage them. Also purposes must be identified  which guide the parts of the web to navigate and to self-organize.\nPROCESSES AND POLITICS \nIn addition to these obvious and mechanical flows there is the aspect of networks that make them look and act a lot more like a family or a garden than a machine. Machine-like relationships need to be dealt with mechanically and family-like relationships require a different approach. So our problem-solving will fall into two broad categories: processes and politics. Processes turn on mechanics, politics turn on purposes. Ultimately our map of connections needs to be able to represent both processes and purpose determined networks. There are food networks. There are education networks. There are health networks. There are justice networks and incarceration networks. Purpose is the center or the defining and driving force of dynamic social networks. State the purpose, draw the network—make it visible. Make its structure viable. Make it more effective. Make it more efficient. Purposeful, visible, viable, effective, efficient—in that order, with those nesting priorities.\nWe must not continue like the man looking for his keys in the lamp light when he actually drop them in the dark. We must shed light on the hidden parts and relationship to find our cherished futures.\nThis now visible network of relationships must be able to accommodate process improvement and lean methods, political negotiations, and customer navigation.\nThese networks must be displayed on recognizable geographical maps. They must be able to show the status of relationships programs projects and processes. Sectors networks, such as education, health and justice present some of the most powerful opportunity for innovations. Beyond that, there will be linkages across sector boundaries.\nSURVEYS\nThe platform must be able to integrate survey data with the network and display it visually on maps.\nGEOSPATIAL MAPS—FOR UNDERSTANDING AND NAVIGATING\nIt must be able to accommodate geographical maps, logic maps, and process maps.\nThe platform must be able to display relevant connections for any user. A mother would likely have different connections than a hospital CEO or an insurance company CEO.\nIn the final analysis these are navigation maps, to trace your path through a maze. Also so we can design new paths. They provide the information so that one can navigate whatever level or layer of the map that's relevant to your purpose.\nSimply put, those that can manage networks in support of customers needs will survive and those that cannot will go out of business. In a massively connected world, visualizing and managing relationships between institutions is the difference between survival and failure. It is a very good survival tool and strategy. Being overwhelmed by the number of connections, by complexity, is not a good survival strategy. There is a middle way.\nThe best methodology and the political skills in the world can't help if you haven't seen the critical connections. Going forward, what you don't see will kill you. Strategies for interaction will produce better results than isolation and protectionism.\nThese maps let you see the missing opportunities and have those missing conversation. They dramatically expand the playing field and those who can step onto that field and up to that challenge will win. Once you have a shared connection map and a few new skills you can navigate complexity and create meaningful patterns out of chaos. This approach will be less frustrating, more interesting, and more profitable.\n####TOOLS FOR COMMUNITY ORGANIZING, PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT\nCommunity level linkage maps are a critical navigation, planning, and strategic prioritization tools for all wellbeing related institutions in the community or region. Selected strategies can be depicted on the linkage map and tactics can even be followed and monitored or superimposed on the linkage map. Any particular institution can see the opportunities, threats and potential partnerships on this map and can therefore create their strategic plans from it.\n\nShared Feb. 9, 2019 by\n_Author: Marc Pierson, protected by Community Commons—Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)_\n(img)\n"

In my particular case, it is expanding from household cooperation to neighborhood scale cooperation. Also we need to be able to cooperate more often and faster. Without a graph visualization tool (nodes, connections, and pathways) we cannot share and  understand complex systems. Without a GIS tool we cannot visualize where the systems components are located nor their geographic patterns of interactions. Without a property graph database we cannot afford the cost of writing queries to discover patterns in the data."
