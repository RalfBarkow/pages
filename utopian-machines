Leibniz advanced the idea, reminiscent of Plato, that the principles of all branches of knowledge either were or participated in “truths of reason,” a realm which encompassed rational theology, metaphysics, logic, and pure mathematics. The veracity of a concept was to be demonstrated by analyzing it into its simple components, or predicates, and 1 ien seeing whether these components and their relations gave an adequate, noncontradictory account of it, and if the concept was a “mixed truth,” i.e., at once a truth of reason and a truth of fact-as the principles of the sciences would be-the criteria of veracity would have to include observation and experimentation. Indeed, testing truths of the mixed variety would serve as a guide to making observations and designing experiments.* Once matters of fact were agreed upon, disputes ranging from those in metaphysics through those in the sciences to those in jurisprudence would be resolved not by fruitless, and often acrimonious, debate, but by the injunction “Let’s calculate!”; for at the heart of the Universal Characteristic lay the assumption that its logical operations could be performed by the rules and signs of a new arithmetic that Leibniz tried to invent intermittently over the course of his life."

      "text": "Mathematics relies on numbers. These need not be decentary. Already in the 1690s Leibniz found a way to translate ordinary numbers into the binary notation of 0’s and 1’s. It stands to reason that a philosopher who formally posed the question of why something exists rather than nothing should be fascinated by a notation that symbolizes in the starkest and simplest way the antinomy between being and nothingness. That the system could serve as an ideal code for expressing and manipulating ideas became apparent to him through the mediation of a member of the Jesuits’ China Mission, Fr. Joachim Bouvet. Leibniz had shared his understanding of the binary system in a letter to Bouvet after the Jesuit had persuaded him that the hexagrams of the [[I Ching]] were a simple and natural representation of the principles of all the sciences as well as of a perfect metaphysics that the Chinese had forgotten before the advent of Confucius. Bouvet in his reply perceived a connection between the binary system and the hexagrams, and he included a woodcut of a hexagramic arrangement attributed to Fu-Hsi, the mythical founder of ancient Chinese culture. Leibniz, convinced, interpreted the broken lines in these hexagrams as 0’s and the full lines as 1’s. Leibniz believed that they summarized metaphysical and scientific principles, and he was certain Fu-Hsi had nothing less in mind than biblical creation when he invented the trigrams from which the hexagrams were formed. Soon Leibniz was elaborating upon these views in an essay for the French Academy of the Sciences and in a discourse on the natural theology of the Chinese. That he was wrong about Fu-Hsi in particular and Chinese hexagrams in general pales before the fact that he used binary numbers to express some of the concepts meant to be manipulated by the Universal Characteristic.
