        "text": "However, Kant had already lost the desire for such division games and saw here only a cognitive technique. But substitutes are not easy to obtain. Kant prefers the concept of interaction, which points ahead to later theories of circular self-reference; but formulated as a causal concept, this solution hides a paradox, because causality presupposes time and therefore excludes time-stable identity of causes and effects with the possibility of a reaction of the effects on the causes. Remained is the suggestion to pass from [[what-questions]] to how-questions (with Kant: as a question about the conditions of possibility), but the transcendental dissolution of the circle of cognition, which has to presuppose itself, hardly finds approval today; because it had to prove what had to be renounced, namely the essence cosmos and the cognizability of the thing in itself, as an achievement of consciousness."
