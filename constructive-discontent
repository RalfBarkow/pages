I often have a healthy feeling of dissatisfaction with how things are, that things could be better, and have the a desire to do something about the situation. This is especially true in relation to schools. I now understand that this feeling is the precursor to important creative breakthroughs, and I tell my story because I feel humanity needs some of these now more than ever."

One of me being dissatisfied, frustrated, even angry, about some aspect of what I saw as an imposed but misplaced education agenda, or some practices in the school I was leading that weren't about learning. This dissatisfaction has motivated me to do act, and to seek solutions and new approaches. "

This was often sparked by [[Colliding Ideas]] collected from various sources, perhaps a conference, a connection between research and an opportunity presented by a particular school context, and the joy of [[Eureka Moments]] when I saw something for the first time. In recent years this disposition has also brought me to more carefully consider my 'why'."

This fueled in me a drive to innovate and while what I achieved may not have been overly bold or disruptive, at the core was to have my school do more for the students, to have learning come alive. While what I was doing was 'tinkering' with schooling, I know the impacts of these innovations were important for my students - especially those a standard deviation or more from the mean. The students disengaged from boredom, and those disengaged by frustration."

I have an impatience with the dogged persistence of a schooling system tenaciously holding on to old ways and its all encompassing conviction this is the right thing to do. I believe we need a new narrative for schooling, if not a new narrative for humanity. And I realise that what I've been learning recently, although it has challenged me and how I view the world, is offering a meaningful way forward. "

Another, although its part of who I am, in my DNA, meant I didn't develop the confidence to pursue my dreams. And the third was the contradictions contained in the societal expectations of a boy in a western industrial time. This is my story."
