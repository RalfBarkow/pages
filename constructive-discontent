I often have a healthy feeling of dissatisfaction with how things are, that things could be better, and I have the a desire to do something about the situation. I now understand that this feeling is the precursor to important creative breakthroughs, and tell my story to share some recent and life changing learnings."

One of me being dissatisfied, frustrated, even angry, about some aspect of what I saw as an imposed but misplaced education agenda, or some practices in the school I was leading that weren't about learning. This dissatisfaction has motivated me to do act, and to seek solutions and new approaches. "

In hindsight what I achieved may not have been overly bold or disruptive innovations, but at the core was to have my school do more for the students, to have learning come alive. I concede what while what I was doing was 'tinkering' with schooling, I know the impacts of these innovations were important for least some of my students - those a standard deviation or more from the mean. The students disengaged from boredom and those disengaged by frustration. "

      "text": "While people around me seemed happy with how things were, most of the staff and many of my contemporaries included, I could see an opportunity to challenge accepted practice. This was often sparked by [[Colliding Ideas]] collected from various sources, perhaps a conference, a connection between research and an opportunity presented by a particular school context, and the joy of the [[Eureka moment]] when I saw something for the first time. In recent years this disposition has also brought me to more carefully consider my 'why'."

I have an impatience with the dogged persistence of a schooling system tenaciously holding on to old ways and its all encompassing conviction this is the right thing to do. I believe we need a new narrative for schooling, if not a new narrative for humanity. And I realise that what I've been learning recently, although it has challenged me and how I view the world, is offering a meaningful way forward. This is my story."

Grouping by the number of years a student has been in a school (i.e. their grade level) defeats some, and bores others.  In addition, the students in the bottom 10% of the cohort never read as well as the top 10% - even at the completion of schooling. This research has long term consequences for the individual and society."
