      "text": "I'm a constructive discontent. My close friends have accused me of wearing the 'black hat' too often. I often have a healthy feeling of dissatisfaction with how things are, that things could be better, and have the desire to do something about the situation. This conviction is especially true in relation to schools. I now understand that this feeling is the precursor to important creative breakthroughs, and I tell my story because I feel humanity needs some of these now more than ever."

One of me being dissatisfied, frustrated, even angry, about some aspect of what I saw as an imposed but misplaced education agenda, or some practices in the school I was leading that wasn't about learning. This dissatisfaction has motivated me to act, and to seek solutions and new approaches. "

      "text": "While people around me seemed happy with how things were, many of my contemporaries included, I could see an opportunity to challenge accepted practice. This intention was often sparked by [[Colliding Ideas]] collected from various sources, perhaps a conference, a connection between research and an opportunity presented by a particular school context, and the joy of [[Eureka Moments]] when I saw something for the first time. In recent years this disposition has also brought me to more carefully consider my 'why'."

      "text": "The frustration and anger I felt was not driven by malice, but rather a compelling belief that things should, and could, 'be better' - a virtuous anger. This fueled in me a drive to innovate and while what I achieved may not have been overly bold or disruptive, at the core was to have my school better meet the needs of each of the students, to have learning come alive for them. While what I was doing was 'tinkering' with schooling, I know the impacts of these innovations were important for my students - especially those who might not be seen as the ‘good’ student - those disengaged from boredom, and those disengaged by frustration."

I have an impatience with the dogged persistence of a schooling system tenaciously holding on to old ways and its all-encompassing conviction this is the right thing to do. I believe we need a new narrative for schooling, if not a new narrative for humanity. And I realise that what I've been learning recently, although it has challenged me and how I view the world, is offering a meaningful way forward. "

Another, although its part of who I am, in my DNA, meant I didn't develop the confidence to pursue my dreams. And the third was the contradictions contained in the societal expectations of a boy in a western industrial time. This is my story."

I often have a healthy feeling of dissatisfaction with how things are, that things could be better, and have the desire to do something about the situation. This conviction is especially true in relation to schools. I now understand that this feeling is the precursor to important creative breakthroughs, and I tell my story because I feel humanity needs some of these now more than ever."

I have an impatience with the dogged persistence of a schooling system tenaciously holding on to old ways and its all-encompassing conviction this is the right thing to do. I believe we need a new narrative for schooling, if not a new narrative for humanity. And I realise that what I've been learning recently, although it has challenged me and how I view the world, is offering a meaningful way forward. "
