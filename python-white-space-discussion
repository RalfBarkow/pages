If I was already going to write my code that way, then why does Python force me to? If I need to be forced to write readable code, is Python's whitespace going to keep me from engaging in [[Three Star Programming]]? Is there really a benefit, then? -- [[Dave Fayram]]",

As for said C coder never making said mistake, umm, hello!  I've been coding in C since 1985, and I still make the aforementioned mistake, particularly when I'm time-stressed.  What sucks is that I never find out about it until runtime.  (Here's a quick tip to solve that problem though: always pair an if with an else, like this:  if(condition) thenDo1() andDo2() else;.  The \"dangling else\" in this case will appear outside of the lexical scope of the if statement, and thus, is a syntax error.  But, I digress).  I see you also recommend a different approach -- whereby the coder <b>forces himself</b> to always use { and }.  Hmmm, this is like a machine language coder <b>forcing himself</b> to properly observe types in his code.  It can be done, but ... WHY?!  The computer is so much more effective at ensuring and automating the process.  So please don't make incorrect, blanket statements about the superiority of C coders over everyone else.
