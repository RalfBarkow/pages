        "text": "The invention of the electronic calculation machines has improved this cognition technique again enormously. Above all, it has made it possible to simulate time sequences; and in the resulting theory of dynamic systems, it has led to the fact that the researcher can surprise himself already by his own models. Even in simulation, systems behave in ways that the designer of these models cannot predict. The unpredictability is included, so to speak. And then, of course, it can no longer be surprising that the real systems also behave unpredictably. Model calculation and reality now converge, it seems, in the [[Prediction of Unpredictability]].\n\n"
