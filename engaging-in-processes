The entertainment industry thrives on the fact that market successes can also be made unavailable, not by money and not by technology: a book, a movie, a song can have been reviewed and rejected by all the major publishers and still become a global hit, and conversely it can flop even though millions have been invested in advertising. Sports and especially commercial soccer would become completely uninteresting if success could simply be bought and technically calculated.\n"

The entertainment industry thrives on the fact that market successes can also be made unavailable, not by money and not by technology: a book, a movie, a song can have been reviewed and rejected by all the major publishers and still become a global hit, and conversely it can flop even though millions have been invested in advertising. As already stated in the introduction, sports and especially commercial soccer would become completely uninteresting if success could simply be bought and technically calculated.\n"
