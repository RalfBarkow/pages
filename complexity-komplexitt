Since the world is conceived as a unity of the difference between system and environment, complexity is also relative to this difference and is dependent on the observation of this difference through meaning-constituting systems. Complexity (including that of the environment) exists only when it is observed by a system. The relevance of observation for the construction of complexity is particularly emphasized in the concept of hypercomplexity, which means that complexity also includes the consequences of its observation. Hypercomplexity is the result of a second-order observation [→[[Operation/Observation]]], i.e., the result of including the observing system in the observation: a society, for instance, is hypercomplex if it observes the consequences of its observations on its environment.\n"

In a (social) system, it is not possible to actualize everything in the operations (in the communication) at the same time, for the reason that complexity is structured according to a perspective of compatibility with the environment.\n"

A system can increase its complexity in connection with an increase in the complexity of its environment—not because it conforms to the environmental complexity, but because it operates autonomously on the basis of its own structures. The increase in complexity in a system triggers an increase in complexity in the systems observing it, because their environments become more complex. Under these conditions, an evolution of the system is possible; however, this evolution is not a simple increase in complexity, but rather a change in structure.\n"

The increase in complexity—i.e., in the relations between the elements—entails limits to the widening of the system: no system can withstand an arbitrary and undefined increase in its complexity. Thus, limits are drawn within the system, which generate subsystems. The form of differentiation among subsystems determines the limits of complexity that can be attained in the system. The changes in the level of complexity can trigger changes in the system form of differentiation. Changing the system differentiation criteria has decisive consequences for the level of complexity that the system can tolerate. This is particularly important for the system of society; today’s society, for instance, generates far greater complexity than earlier societies due to its forms of differentiation [→[[Differentiation of Society]]].

        "text": "However, the concepts of complexity and differentiation can be linked together. The increase in complexity—i.e., in the relations between the elements—entails limits to the widening of the system: no system can withstand an arbitrary and undefined increase in its complexity. Thus, limits are drawn within the system, which generate subsystems. The form of differentiation among subsystems determines the limits of complexity that can be attained in the system. The changes in the level of complexity can trigger changes in the system form of differentiation. Changing the system differentiation criteria has decisive consequences for the level of complexity that the system can tolerate. This is particularly important for the system of society; today’s society, for instance, generates far greater complexity than earlier societies due to its forms of differentiation [→[[Differentiation of Society]]].
