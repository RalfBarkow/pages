Product Quantization (PQ) search and its derivatives are popular and successful methods for large-scale approximated nearest neighbor search. In this paper, we review the fundamental algorithm of this class of algorithms and provide executable sample codes. We then provide a comprehensive survey of the recent PQ-based methods.\n"
