The MLO in Khorog has service centers in adjacent districts; similarly the MLOs in Shamsiddin Shohin, Fayzabad and Ishkashim have service centers in nearby districts, with plans for MLO [[Darvoz]] to also expand its footprint. The unprecedented consolidation of these MLOs in mid-2016 further strengthened their roots in communities and set the stage for them to offer even more deposit and saving options. Together these financial services have the potential to reach nearly 1 million people who live in these districts who didn’t have that access and reliability before."
