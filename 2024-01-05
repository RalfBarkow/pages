The last time he submitted something to PLoP was 25 years ago. He has found that the whole process of shepherding and workshopping has been very valuable in improving the quality of the patterns.\n\nHe plans to reach out to the community soon to see if anyone is willing to review the draft before they submit it. The deadline is in February.\n\nSee the \"Glamorous Toolkit User Meeting 2023\" video for context: https://youtu.be/90WbS30lo1Q?t=617\n\nI am considering attending the EuroPLoP conference and would be happy if we could participate in the review proposed by Oscar."

Rethinking Artificial Intelligence: Algorithmic Bias and Ethical Issues| The Realienation of the Commons: Wikidata and the Ethics of “Free” Data. International Journal of Communication. Online. 26 December 2023. Vol. 18, no. 0, p. 19. Available from: https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/20807 [Accessed 5 January 2024]. \nWikipedia’s founding in 2001, accompanied by the techno-optimism of Web 2.0 and the ambitious agenda for free knowledge, inspired countless volunteers to contribute. The success of the encyclopedia both inspired and provided evidence of the power of “wikinomics,” “crowd-sourcing,” and “commons-based peer production.” In many ways, Wikipedia, and its parent company Wikimedia, can be viewed as the standard-bearers of Web 2.0’s early promises for a free and open Web. However, the introduction of Wikipedia’s sister project Wikidata and its movement away from “share alike” licensing has dramatically shifted the relationship between editors and complicated Wikimedia’s ethics as it relates to the digital commons. This article investigates concerns surrounding what we term the “re-alienation of the commons,” especially as it relates to Google and other search engine companies’ reliance on data emerging from free/libre and open-source (FOSS/FLOSS) Web movements of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Taking a Marxist approach, this article explores the labor relationship of editors to Wikimedia projects and how this “realienation” threatens this relationship, as well as the future of the community.

It mostly discusses a claim, due to [[Andy Clark]], that words are not [[Label]]s for concepts. Rather, words come first and concepts accrete around them. As a resolute, concepts are messy. Which is fine, because they don't need to be tidy."

The success of the encyclopedia both inspired and provided evidence of the power of “wikinomics,” “crowd-sourcing,” and “commons-based peer production.” In many ways, Wikipedia, and its parent company Wikimedia, can be viewed as the standard-bearers of Web 2.0’s early promises for a free and open Web. However, the introduction of Wikipedia’s sister project Wikidata and its movement away from “share alike” licensing has dramatically shifted the relationship between editors and complicated Wikimedia’s ethics as it relates to the digital commons. This article investigates concerns surrounding what we term the “re-alienation of the commons,” especially as it relates to Google and other search engine companies’ reliance on data emerging from free/libre and open-source (FOSS/FLOSS) Web movements of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Taking a Marxist approach, this article explores the labor relationship of editors to Wikimedia projects and how this “realienation” threatens this relationship, as well as the future of the community.\n"
