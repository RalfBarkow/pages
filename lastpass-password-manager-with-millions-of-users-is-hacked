LastPass' Karim Toubba said a developer account had been breached, allowing an unauthorized party to access the company's development environment. The unusual activity was detected two weeks ago, prompting an investigation. Toubba said the company is working with a cybersecurity and forensics firm and has rolled out additional security measures. LastPass stores encrypted login information that users can access online with a master password, but they cannot see customers' data."
