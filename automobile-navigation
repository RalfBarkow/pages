That we find our way outside the latter with the same self-evidence as within it: we succeed better and better by letting others perform our own orientation services. \"Where am I?\" - We let others tell us and show us. \"How do I get to my destination?\" - We let others find the way and lead us there. We delegate self-localization and destination finding, not to other people, although of course there is that too, but to technical devices: to the Global Positioning System and to individual navigation systems that record its performance and convert it into leadership knowledge.\n\nThrough the navigation devices in the various vehicles with which we move, we tie this knowledge back to our familiar living environment. Because of its individuality, the car plays a prominent role in this process: it is itself part of my living environment, a mobile piece of it; in this, it is very similar to myself. Automobile navigation thus means: Connection of a system that guides us, as if everywhere were our lifeworld, to this lifeworld itself. - This is the theme that [[Manfred Sommer]] will unfold in the following five chapters.\n\nIn the 12th chapter, I recall how the geographic grid functions as a name-giver and guide. By looking at the globe as a whole, the previous considerations on cartography and digital maps are globalized, so to speak. The result makes it understandable how we can name and find places with the help of a world-spanning coordinate system. As abstract as this geometric system looks: it is nevertheless anchored with its origin in terrestrial conditions and finds as a constitutive element entrance into all satellite-bound navigation systems.\n\n"
