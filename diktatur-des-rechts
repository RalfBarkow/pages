        "text": "In retrospect, this dictatorship of the law was to be understood as the \"subordination of the judiciary to politics\" and as a massive encroachment by Putin on the constitutionally guaranteed legal order. \"In fact,\" writes [[Caroline von Gall]], \"Putin's assumption of office was a turning point for the development of the rule of law.\" Whereas under Yeltsin fundamental postulates of a constitutional order had been anchored, including the monopoly on judges, the prohibition of courts of exception, the right of access to the courts, and the subsidiarity of the courts, under Putin the practice of so-called \"telephone justice,\" the massive influence of the executive branch on the process of finding justice, began.36 The president's right to \"determine the personnel composition of the Federation Council\" through the governors of the regions also undermines the system of checks and balances provided for in the constitution: \"This also has an effect, for example, on the appointment of the chief judges as well as the procurator general, who are to be proposed by the president and appointed by the Federation Council. \"37 This leads to a massive instrumentalization of the law, which is also reflected in show trials,38 as could be observed, for example, in the trial of oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky. This goes hand in hand with the \"imitation of a liberal-democratic and constitutional system, \"39 so that Putin formally \"left the institutions and fundamental provisions of the constitution untouched; formally, democracy and the separation of powers were preserved as a hallmark and achievement of the post-Soviet order. One has tried to characterize this ambiguity with the term 'para-constitutionalism'. What is meant is obvious: that outward appearances were maintained, but the powers of the regular organs were undermined by transferring them to new bodies created by the president and dependent on him."
