The microprocessors are embedded in the circuit design of the logic board which is itself an entangled network of components."

At the physical layer we can look at tangles of wires and talk about coax vs twisted-pair vs fiber—oh, or interference between various radio waves. The paths of the wires themselves are a network. Circuits in the network cards are a network. The routers maintain a distributed model of the physical network in the form of routing tables through the use of complex protocols. In the OSI model I've only mentioned layers 1, 2 & 3. Layer 4 is where you find TCP & UDP."
