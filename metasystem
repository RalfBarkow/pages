The explicit employment of a metasystem allows questions which are not decidable between competing systems or within the boundaries of a system to be discussed in a language (or metalanguage) of a higher order.\n"

The actors in the Metasystem structure lose their intimate contact with the Operations System. They shift their stance, viewing the Operations System primarily as sources of material and energy for the Metasystem. The Metasystem has lost its Operations system and has begun treating it as captive part of the environment--an [[Enclosure]].\n"
