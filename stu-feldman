The \"make\" program is a build automation tool that uses a [[Directed Acyclic Graph]] (DAG) to determine which source files need to be recompiled, based on their dependencies. The program is widely used in software development, and is a standard tool on Unix-based systems. Feldman's algorithm for the \"make\" program is considered a seminal development in the field of software engineering and is still widely used today."
