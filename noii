These connections proved to be important for the next marker."

This was an outstanding learning experience for all involved with highlights being the school visits in Vancouver Island North, Cowichan, Delta, Vancouver and West Vancouver districts. This study tour included members of the leadership team from Griffin State School, including the principal Vicki Baker. This was not the first time Vicki and I had shared learning experiences but the trust established as a result of this shared experience was to become the foundation for some powerful future work. I continue to learn so much from Vicki's leadership in a wonderful school."

Both countries have small populations for their land area with the majority of the population centred in a few major cities. This also means many schools are located in small communities in rural and remote areas. Both countries have First Nations with rich histories that go back well before colonial settlement. And both have the complexity of dealing with the disadvantage and discrimination that their colonial past brought to the First Nations.\n"

This was an outstanding learning experience for all involved with highlights being the school visits in Vancouver Island North, Cowichan, Delta, Vancouver and West Vancouver districts. This study tour included members of the leadership team from Griffin State School, including the principal Vicki Baker. This was not the first time Vicki and I had shared learning experiences but the trust established as a result of this shared experience was to become the foundation for some powerful work. I continue to learn so much from Vicki's leadership in a wonderful school."

Both countries have small populations for their land area with the majority of the population centred in a few major cities. This also means many schools are located in small communities in rural and remote areas. Both countries have First Nations with rich histories that go back well before colonial settlement. And both have the complexity of dealing with the disadvantage and discrimination that their colonial past brought to the First Nations.\n"
