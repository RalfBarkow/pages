'Learning First' had just released the report 'Beyond PD: Professional Learning in High Performing Systems' (Jensen, Sonnemann, Roberts-Hull & Hunter, 2016). This report had identified British Columbia as the highest performing English speaking jurisdiction in the PISA rakings (first for reading, second for mathematics and third for science, above the Canadian average and well ahead of Australia) and had attributed this high performance to the collaboration and professional learning approaches in the province, highlighting the Networks of Inquiry and Innovation (NOII).

The first was me being invited to the NOII Symposium in Vancouver in May 2016.

These connections proved to be important for the next marker."

This was an outstanding learning experience for all involved. This study tour included members of the leadership team from Griffin State School, including the principal Vicki Baker. This was not the first time Vicki and I had shared learning experiences but the trust established as a result of this shared experience was to become the foundation for some powerful future work. I continue to learn so much from Vicki's leadership in her wonderful school."

Both countries have small populations for their land area with the majority of the population centred in a few major cities. This also means many schools are located in small communities in rural and remote areas. Both countries have First Nations with rich histories that go back well before colonial settlement. And both have the complexity of dealing with the disadvantage and discrimination that their colonial past brought to the First Nations.\n"

Both countries have small populations for their land area with the majority of the population centred in a few major cities. This also means many schools are located in small communities in rural and remote areas. Both countries have First Nations with rich histories that go back well before colonial settlement. And both have the complexity of dealing with the disadvantage and discrimination that their colonial past brought to the First Nations.\n"
