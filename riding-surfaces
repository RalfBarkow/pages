Other than maintaining concentration, the main problem with using a field is the damage to the surface that lunging creates. This can be minimised by never lunging in the same place but some damage is still inevitable. A fenced circular lunge ring defines the limit of the circle and therefore acts as an ‘outside aid’. However, it is difficult in a lunge ring to create straight lines or to move the circle. My preference is to lunge in an arena. In that way it is possible to use an end of the arena for control (only one open side), or to move the circle to the centre (completely open) when I have the horse’s attention.",
