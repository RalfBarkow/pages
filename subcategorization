We hone in on one particular use of the term subcategorization, as relates to properties of individual exponents (morphs); see e.g. Lieber 1980; Kiparsky 1982; Selkirk 1982; Inkelas 1990; Paster 2006; Yu 2007; Bye and Svenonius 2012; McPherson 2019. Our goal is to show that, even at this fine level of granularity, subcategorization must be bifurcated into two separate and universally ordered mechanisms."
