      "text": "Despite the progress in text comprehension, the NLP expert still sees weaknesses with Bert. Referring to MIT's \"Global Sentiment\" studies, he says there is the problem that tweets can be neutral, or that Twitter users express multiple, split sentiments. The system doesn't recognize ambiguity or irony well, he said. \"I lose anything in between, anything multi-faceted,\" Reimers said. Apart from that, he said, it is questionable to what extent the evaluation of tweets really provides a representative picture of sentiment. \"My grandparents are not on Twitter,\" the computer scientist clarifies the bias. Users of the social medium tend to be young, extroverted and inclined to more extreme opinions."

Unclear about session management, auth, etc...\nI feel like there are a lot of pieces parts lying around but doing the integration is still overly complicated.  I want to just tell a textfield to be sync'd to the back end with a callback block or something.  I am looking for a development experience (nearly) indistinguishable from a conventional GUI.  [[Willow]] looked promising but I found the programming ponderous.\nStill plodding along with jQuery and I find it unreasonably difficult to compose the Pharoized [[jQuery]] incantation to sync a form element to my in memory model."
