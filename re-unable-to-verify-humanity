      "text": "Recently ACM TechNews foregrounded an article from the Associated Press, &#8220;Voting experts warn of 'Serious Threats' for 2024 from election equipment software breaches'', by Christina A. Cassidy. The article reported on a letter sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly.  I coordinated the letter which was signed by over a dozen computer and election security experts, including several members of ACM.  The letter reiterated a call to the federal agencies to investigate what has been unearthed, (through civil litigation and intrepid reporting), to be a coordinated and integrated plot by attorneys and allies of Donald Trump to unlawfully obtain copies of voting system software and share them with a network of extremists and election deniers. Records obtained through discovery in private lawsuits and public records requests have revealed that the schemes to access and obtain copies of the voting software used in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Colorado involved and were funded by many of the same people that were working together to overturn the 2020 presidential election.  Though some states' law enforcement authorities have pursued investigations and charges for those involved in their own states voting system breaches, there is nothing to suggest that federal authorities are investigating the coordination between states, despite an abundance of evidence showing that the conspiracy spanned state lines, and that it was part of the larger plot to keep Trump in power. Moreover, there appears to be no federal investigation to determine how extensively the voting software has been shared, and what the recipients may plan to do with it in the future, hence the calls for federal action.  Computer security experts have warned that unauthorized copies of the voting system software in the wild increases threats against elections. Again  hence the call for a federal investigation. Computer scientists have cautioned that bad actors could load the voting software onto their own devices to create replicas of voting machines in order to probe them for vulnerabilities that could be exploited with minimal physical access, for instance by a poll worker or maintenance staff. Bad actors could also decompile the software and examine it for weaknesses in order to create malware that could be used to corrupt election results. The software could also be used to fabricate evidence in support of false claims and election has been stolen, or in disinformation campaigns. We've already seen this last tactic; at last winter's CPAC, there was a presentation given that purported to examine software taken from Coffee County, Georgia, arguing that the software showed that the election in Georgia had been stolen.  In the election security community, there's long been widespread support for open-source voting system software, and opposition to vendors restrictions to keep voting software proprietary. Some of the most significant revelations regarding voting system security have been the result of security reviews that were not sanctioned by the vendors. At first glance, the support for open source voting software may seem to be at odds with a vociferous call to federal agents to investigate the operatives that took voting software in multiple states, but that doesn't account for several key and crucial differences.  Unlike academic and security researchers that have analyzed voting software in order to identify and publicize security risks in support of more secure systems, the Trump allies that participated in the coordinated scheme to take voting system software did so for a partisan objective to keep Donald Trump in power, according to their own emails and texts. They did not attempt to assess the software and publicize their findings to make elections better; they sought to keep the operations and analyses secret so they could upend an election and discredit democracy. The software was shared, but only among like-minded Trump supporters. It has not been posted publicly, unlike open-sourced systems.  Open-sourced voting systems would greatly improve election system security by enabling public scrutiny of the software code, surfacing bugs more quickly and thoroughly, and by increasing transparency into the systems that count votes. This is not what has occurred with the voting system breaches.  We should still pursue open-sourced voting systems, but that shouldn't preclude calling for a vigorous and immediate investigation into the voting system breaches and misappropriation of software by Trump allies and election deniers. We can do both. We must do both.  Susan Greenhalgh is the senior advisor for election security at Free Speech For People"
