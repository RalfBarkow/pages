ISBN 978-1-00-060394-1. TK5105.15“This collection approaches the task of accounting for the networked image from the perspective of cultural practitioners engaged in making, curating, teaching, exhibiting, archiving, and preserving born digital objects. The volume signals a passage of time, from the digital to networked image and a corresponding cultural shift from the digital to the post-digital. It seeks to make sense of specific cultural consequences of this rapid succession of technological changes and bring the story up to date. The outcome of ten years of ground-breaking research at The Centre for the Study of the Networked Image (CSNI) in London, it investigates radical changes in the meanings and values of hybridized media in socio-technical networks and speaks to the creeping automation of culture through applications of AI, social media platforms and the financialization of data. It raises critical questions about the Internet’s relationship to computational capitalism and its new forms of digital labour. Contributions cross the disciplines of media and cultural studies, art history, art practice, photographic theory, User design, animation, museology, and computer science. Using research-based practices at the forefront of determining how cultural value is communicated and shared in online cultures - the book will appeal to anyone interested and engaged in critical practice”--\n"
