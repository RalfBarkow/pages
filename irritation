Second, you have to build the concept of information again like a concept of form, that is, as a concept with two sides. On the one hand, there is a surprise, but on the other hand, the surprise exists only because one had expected something and because one delimits a range of possibilities within which then the information can say this and not that. If an acquaintance comes with a new car, there is a certain range of possibilities what kind of car it can be. One will not expect a deck chair when he says he comes with a new car. "

If one says the same thing over and over again, the meaning remains unchanged, but the information disappears altogether or is limited to the fact that someone apparently sees a point in saying the same thing over and over again, and this is surprising because one normally expects each sentence to be followed by another sentence and not the same one, just as a record can have a groove error and then always repeat itself – but then one would at least have the interpretation of a record error in contrast to the normal functioning of a record."

The equilibrium does not have to be maintained by a return to the previous state, but it can develop dynamically, for example, in terms of ideas of progress or in terms of functional equivalents.

However, an exact match would be too unstable to gain any kind of stability. Thus, socialist systems keep goods scarce, while capitalist systems keep buyers scarce; in either case, it is an imbalance that is itself stable.

Man fragt zurück, man thematisiert eine Störung. Man warnt andere, übersetzt also das, was im System verbal formuliert werden kann, obwohl es in der Umwelt nicht als Wort auftaucht, in einen Systemprozess, der keine Resultate garantieren kann, aber doch Möglichkeiten bietet, das System in Gang zu setzen und in Gang zu halten. Der Begriff Störung wird vom Gleichgewichtsmodell abgelöst und wird zur Beschreibung von etwas übernommen, was man eher als Informationsverarbeitungsprozess bezeichnen könnte. Obwohl ich auf diesem Gebiet nicht gut informiert bin, vermute ich, dass heute auch in der Ökonomie eine solche Umsetzung von Gleichgewichtsmodellen auf Informationsverarbeitungsmodelle stattfindet. Der gemeinsame Nenner dieser Theorietransformationsprozesse ist die Frage, wie ein System auf das reagiert, was es als Störung empfindet, obwohl es in der Umwelt natürlich keine Störung ist: durch Wiederherstellung des Gleichgewichtes, durch das Finden eines anderen Gleichgewichtes oder durch Informationsverarbeitungsprozesse, die auf die Kapazität des Systems abgestimmt sind."

One warns others, thus translating what can be verbally formulated in the system, even though it does not appear as a word in the environment, into a system process that cannot guarantee results, but does offer ways to get the system going and keep it going.

Moreover, the semantic side of the term, and thus the question of what information can select from, remained unresolved. If one keeps these two aspects in mind and wants to express them in the form of a concept of information, this would mean, first, that information is always an event, i.e. precisely not something that is constantly present. Bielefeld University, for example, is not information; even if you come here every day, you do not always activate new information according to the pattern: it is still there, and tomorrow you will be surprised again that it is still there. Bielefeld University is a structure that has no informational value, that has meaning - after all, you have a certain idea of why you come here - but it does not yield any new information. So you have to distinguish sense or even structural, relative invariants from the surprise effect of information. Second, you have to build the concept of information again like a concept of form, that is, as a concept with two sides. On the one hand, there is a surprise, but on the other hand, the surprise exists only because one had expected something and because one delimits a range of possibilities within which then the information can say this and not that.

For example, one spoke of genetic information and treated structures as informative in this term, so that, for example, genetic codes contain information according to the linguistic usage of biologists, although they are structures and not events. Moreover, the semantic side of the term, and thus the question of what information can select from, remained unresolved. If one keeps these two aspects in mind and wants to express them in the form of a concept of information, this would mean, first, that information is always an event, i.e. precisely not something that is constantly present. Bielefeld University, for example, is not information; even if you come here every day, you do not always activate new information according to the pattern: it is still there, and tomorrow you will be surprised again that it is still there. Bielefeld University is a structure that has no informational value, that has meaning - after all, you have a certain idea of why you come here - but it does not yield any new information. So you have to distinguish sense or even structural, relative invariants from the surprise effect of information. Second, you have to build the concept of information again like a concept of form, that is, as a concept with two sides. On the one hand, there is a surprise, but on the other hand, the surprise exists only because one had expected something and because one delimits a range of possibilities within which then the information can say this and not that. If an acquaintance comes with a new car, there is a certain range of possibilities what kind of car it can be. One will not expect a deck chair when he says he comes with a new car.
