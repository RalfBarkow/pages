      "text": "A test designed by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's Marcel Grimmer and colleagues found that facial recognition algorithms start running into difficulty identifying people after they have aged five years. The researchers used open-source alternatives to face recognition tools used by police and smartphone manufacturers, as well as AI-generated images of 50,000 humans aged synthetically. Grimmer said the tools' accuracy declined continuously from the point the reference image was captured. The algorithms used to age faces synthetically from reference images also proved more effective when the target was between 20 and 40 years, compared to children and older adults. The implication is that new photos may be needed more often to maintain accuracy and security."
