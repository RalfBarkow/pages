        "text": "Matrix defines APIs for synchronising extensible JSON objects known as \"events\" between compatible clients, servers and services. Clients are typically messaging/VoIP applications or IoT devices/hubs and communicate by synchronising communication history with their \"homeserver\" using the \"Client-Server API\". Each homeserver stores the communication history and account information for all of its clients, and shares data with the wider Matrix ecosystem by synchronising communication history with other homeservers and their clients.\nClients typically communicate with each other by emitting events in the context of a virtual \"room\". Room data is replicated across all of the homeservers whose users are participating in a given room. As such, no single homeserver has control or ownership over a given room. Homeservers model communication history as a partially ordered graph of events known as the room's \"event graph\", which is synchronised with eventual consistency between the participating servers using the \"Server-Server API\". This process of synchronising shared conversation history between homeservers run by different parties is called \"Federation\". Matrix optimises for the the Availability and Partitioned properties of CAP theorem at the expense of Consistency.\nFor example, for client A to send a message to client B, client A performs an HTTP PUT of the required JSON event on its homeserver (HS) using the client-server API. A's HS appends this event to its copy of the room's event graph, signing the message in the context of the graph for integrity. A's HS then replicates the message to B's HS by performing an HTTP PUT using the server-server API. B's HS authenticates the request, validates the event's signature, authorises the event's contents and then adds it to its copy of the room's event graph. Client B then receives the message from his homeserver via a long-lived GET request."
