Examples of such computer-aided research are the analysis of experimental data or the simulation of phenomena based on theoretical models. With the rapid increase of computational power, scientific software has integrated more and more complex scientific knowledge in a black-box fashion. As a consequence, its users do not know, and do not even have a chance of finding out, which assumptions and approximations their computations are based on. This black-box nature of scientific software has made the verification of much computer-aided research close to impossible. The present work starts with an analysis of this situation from the point of view of human-computer interaction in scientific research. It identifies the key role of digital scientific notations at the human-computer interface, reviews the most popular ones in use today, and describes a proof-of-concept implementation of Leibniz, a language designed as a verifiable digital scientific notation for models formulated as mathematical equations.\n"

      "text": "The first few decades of computer-aided research have been marked by the development and application of new computational techniques. They have permitted the exploration of ever more complex systems with ever better precision, but also lead to completely new styles of scientific enquiry based on analyzing large amounts of data by statistical methods. However, the initial enthusiasm about the new possibilities offered by computer-aided research has been dampened in recent years as scientists began to realize that the new technology also brings new kinds of problems. Errors in software, or in the way software is applied, are the most obvious one (Merali, 2010; Soergel, 2014). A more subtle problem is the widespread non-reproducibility of computational results, in spite of the fact that computations, as defined by Turing in 1937 (Turing, 1937), are fully deterministic (Claerbout & Karrenbach, 1992; Stodden et al., 2016). As a consequence, more and more scientific journals require authors to submit, or publish otherwise, the code and data for computational work described in submitted articles, a recent example being Nature (Nature Editors, 2018)."

      "text": "But perhaps the most insidious effect of the use of computers is that scientists are losing control over their models and methods, which are increasingly absorbed by software and thereby opacified, to the point of disappearing from scientific discourse (Hinsen, 2014). As I will discuss in ‘Informal and formal reasoning in scientific discourse’, the consequence is that automated computations are much less verifiable than the manually performed computations of the past. Although limits to reproducibility and verifiability have always been a part of scientific research when dealing with observations, these limits are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those introduced by computer-aided research (Hinsen, 2018)."

Not only population growth, but economic growth. Growth has costs as well as benefits, and we typically don’t count the costs — among which are poverty and hunger, environmental destruction, etc. — the whole list of problems we are trying to solve with growth! What is needed is much slower growth, much different kinds of growth, and in some cases no growth or negative growth."

The less of it there is, the better off the city is — even the low-income folks in the city. This model came out at a time when national policy dictated massive low-income housing projects, and Forrester was derided. Now those projects are being torn down in city after city."

Or if they are, we intuitively use them backward, systematically worsening whatever problems we are trying to solve.\n\nThe systems analysts I know have come up with no quick or easy formulas for finding leverage points. When we study a system, we usually learn where leverage points are. But a new system we’ve never encountered? Well, our counterintuitions aren’t that well developed. Give us a few months or years and we’ll figure it out. And we know from bitter experience that, because of counterintuitiveness, when we do discover the system’s leverage points, hardly anybody will believe us.\n\nVery frustrating, especially for those of us who yearn not just to understand complex systems, but to make the world work better."

The more I listened, the more I began to simmer inside. “This is a HUGE NEW SYSTEM people are inventing!” I said to myself. “They haven’t the SLIGHTEST IDEA how this complex structure will behave,” myself said back to me. “It’s almost certainly an example of cranking the system in the wrong direction — it’s aimed at growth, growth at any price!! And the control measures these nice, liberal folks are talking about to combat it — small parameter adjustments, weak negative feedback loops — are PUNY!!!”"

Or if they are, we intuitively use them backward, systematically worsening whatever problems we are trying to solve.\n\nThe systems analysts I know have come up with no quick or easy formulas for finding leverage points. When we study a system, we usually learn where leverage points are. But a new system we’ve never encountered? Well, our counterintuitions aren’t that well developed. Give us a few months or years and we’ll figure it out. And we know from bitter experience that, because of counterintuitiveness, when we do discover the system’s leverage points, hardly anybody will believe us.\n\nVery frustrating, especially for those of us who yearn not just to understand complex systems, but to make the world work better."

The more I listened, the more I began to simmer inside. “This is a HUGE NEW SYSTEM people are inventing!” I said to myself. “They haven’t the SLIGHTEST IDEA how this complex structure will behave,” myself said back to me. “It’s almost certainly an example of cranking the system in the wrong direction — it’s aimed at growth, growth at any price!! And the control measures these nice, liberal folks are talking about to combat it — small parameter adjustments, weak negative feedback loops — are PUNY!!!”"
