        "text": "> v) _It is convenient to employ common-sense concepts as bases for comparison for parallel fields of evidence among world theories_. \n\n> Dubitanda definitions of a group of facts are the best test definitions for the comparison of parallel danda definitions in different world theories. [....]\n\n> If we want to compare the views of the two men, we can do no better than compare their different interpretations of what may be called the \"same\" fact. Yet the fact is never literally the same, because, if it were, the description or interpretation would be just the same, which never happens if the categories are really different.  [p. 102]\n\n> [....]\n\nAs a maxim of method, then, we find that there is no better way of entering upon the study of a field of fact than through common sense. Let the subject be perception, physical body, personal freedom, the law of gravitation, legal right, aesthetic beauty, myself, identity, space, yellow, saltiness, anger, air, action, truthâ€”whatever you will, the essay or the book will most profitably begin with the common-sense meanings of these terms and then proceed to refinements of interpretation which can be compared with one another on the basis of their mutual points of origin.
