The affirmative character of Lyotard’s aesthetics is already expressed in the title of a German collection of his writings: Essays zu einer affirmativen Ästhetik (1982), which also contains a translation of his essay “La peinture comme dispositif libidinal.” Although the terms culture and aesthetics carry different meanings, Gumbrecht and Lyotard use both terms to discuss basically the same idea."
