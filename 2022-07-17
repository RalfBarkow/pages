      "text": "This theory is relatively new. It was developed in the 1940s on the basis of technical considerations as to how systems, system states and also outputs of systems could be kept stable under variable environmental conditions. The answer to this question lay in the well-known feedback model, i.e. in the idea that there was an apparatus which could measure certain distances, i.e. information from the environment, in relation to a desirable system state and switch on or switch off the mechanics of the system depending on whether the distance provided satisfactory or unsatisfactory measured values. You know this from the example of the thermostat; in the literature this example is also always given as a \"paradigm\" in the original sense, that is, as an example, as a prototype. But there were many other tasks in the 1940s that people tried to solve with corresponding models, not least in war technology, for example. Whereas in the past, when you had to shoot at aircraft with anti-aircraft guns, you had to deal with a mechanical device, with a ring through which you had to look and orient the guns, depending on how you had to hold forward and so on, this was now automated so that the distance could be measured and converted in each case and you could increase the accuracy independently of the gunner's eye. This was one of the tasks at that time. However, it was immediately recognized that there was a general principle underlying this, which is also used in biology, for example, when it is a question of keeping the blood temperature or the sugar content of the blood constant. So there are devices that are not constantly in operation, but only come into operation when certain defects, certain distances, certain differences assume a value that is too large."

      "text": "So why is this model so significant? First of all, it is generalizable. That is one point. The attraction was to keep trying it out in new areas. Second, it was possible to believe that in this way one could reformulate the old teleology, that is, the old theory of purpose. With teleology, one had had in the old European framework the idea that there are certain purposes which attract causal processes, which thus enter into the process as cause itself, although they are future states. This had already been abandoned in the early modern period and replaced by mental causes, that is, it was now imagined that purposes are current, present conceptions of future states conditioned by past experiences, and that these conceptions, because they are now already there, can mechanically trigger certain motor activities. In the ductus of this, if you will, mechanization of teleological causalities, cybernetics was now able to explain somewhat more precisely than before how it is possible or what apparatures are presupposed if one wants to keep certain system states stable. The hope was not only directed to generalization per se, but also to the reconstruction of a classical stream of thought with modern, let us say, technical means. Finally, that was the reason for the name, control ideas were added. Cybernetes is the helmsman of a ship, and one could well imagine that if one wants to keep a ship on a straight course, one has to correct the conditions of wind and waves, i.e. counter-steer or re-steer if necessary, in order to keep the course. Cybernetes is the helmsman, and cybernetics is the science of the art of steering technical, perhaps also psychological, in any case also social systems."

      "text": "The transition from first-order cybernetics to second-order cybernetics becomes visible in the now famous thermostat example. Second-order cybernetics argues that here the controlled (heater) and the controller (thermostat) control each other reciprocally and that through this reciprocal control the clear distinction between controller and controlled becomes impossible. The clear distinction is replaced by a \"control of control\" (Esposito 2005, 295). In the final analysis, this means that both the establishment and deconstruction of the controlled/controller distinction are attributional phenomena. An observer observes a behavior and then retroactively marks one position as the controlled and the other as the controller (Glanville 1988, 205); thus, the concept of 'control of control' is also an epiphenomenon of the observation process and the resulting \"bindings are not a priori given data but a posteriori [observer] inferred consequences\" (Esposito 2005, 295).\n\nWith second-order cybernetics, \"observation [...] is understood as an ultimate or guiding concept that is always presupposed\" (Fuchs 2004, 11) and thus one can speak of a super-epistemitude of the concept of observation. The two basic formulas are, \"Everything that is said is said by an observer\" (Maturana 2002, 24) and, \"Everything said is said to an observer\" (Foerster 1993a, 85). All qualities and properties of things, objects, systems, etc. are thus not the qualities and properties of things, objects, and systems, but those of their description by the observer observing them (Esposito 2005, 298), more radically, \"the observer is the world\" (ibid., 296), and thus it is not the reality of the world that is relevant, but the \"reflexivity of observation\" (ibid., 293). This epistemological position ties second-order cybernetics very closely to the epistemology of constructivism (Foerster is in this sense both cyberneticist and constructivist (Foerster 1981, 1993b u. 2003))."

        "text": "The transition from first-order cybernetics to second-order cybernetics becomes visible in the now famous thermostat example. Second-order cybernetics argues that here the controlled (heater) and the controller (thermostat) control each other reciprocally and that through this reciprocal control the clear distinction between controller and controlled becomes impossible. The clear distinction is replaced by a \"control of control\" (Esposito 2005, 295). In the final analysis, this means that both the establishment and deconstruction of the controlled/controller distinction are attributional phenomena. An observer observes a behavior and then retroactively marks one position as the controlled and the other as the controller (Glanville 1988, 205); thus, the concept of 'control of control' is also an epiphenomenon of the observation process and the resulting \"bindings are not a priori given data but a posteriori [observer] inferred consequences\" (Esposito 2005, 295).\n\nWith second-order cybernetics, \"observation [...] is understood as an ultimate or guiding concept that is always presupposed\" (Fuchs 2004, 11) and thus one can speak of a super-epistemitude of the concept of observation. The two basic formulas are, \"Everything that is said is said by an observer\" (Maturana 2002, 24) and, \"Everything said is said to an observer\" (Foerster 1993a, 85). All qualities and properties of things, objects, systems, etc. are thus not the qualities and properties of things, objects, and systems, but those of their description by the observer observing them (Esposito 2005, 298), more radically, \"the observer is the world\" (ibid., 296), and thus it is not the reality of the world that is relevant, but the \"reflexivity of observation\" (ibid., 293). This epistemological position ties second-order cybernetics very closely to the epistemology of constructivism (Foerster is in this sense both cyberneticist and constructivist (Foerster 1981, 1993b u. 2003)).

        "text": "So why is this model so significant? First of all, it is generalizable. That is one point. The attraction was to keep trying it out in new areas. Second, it was possible to believe that in this way one could reformulate the old teleology, that is, the old theory of purpose. With teleology, one had had in the old European framework the idea that there are certain purposes which attract causal processes, which thus enter into the process as cause itself, although they are future states. This had already been abandoned in the early modern period and replaced by mental causes, that is, it was now imagined that purposes are current, present conceptions of future states conditioned by past experiences, and that these conceptions, because they are now already there, can mechanically trigger certain motor activities. In the ductus of this, if you will, mechanization of teleological causalities, cybernetics was now able to explain somewhat more precisely than before how it is possible or what apparatures are presupposed if one wants to keep certain system states stable. The hope was not only directed to generalization per se, but also to the reconstruction of a classical stream of thought with modern, let us say, technical means. Finally, that was the reason for the name, control ideas were added. Cybernetes is the helmsman of a ship, and one could well imagine that if one wants to keep a ship on a straight course, one has to correct the conditions of wind and waves, i.e. counter-steer or re-steer if necessary, in order to keep the course. Cybernetes is the helmsman, and cybernetics is the science of the art of steering technical, perhaps also psychological, in any case also social systems."
