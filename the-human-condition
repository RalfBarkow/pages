Yet the same phenomenon is blamed with equal right for the hardly less demonstrable increase in human despair or the specifically modern nihilism which has spread to ever larger sections of the population, their most significant aspect perhaps being that they no longer spare the scientists themselves, whose well-founded optimism could still, in the nineteenth century, stand up against the equally justifiable pessimism of thinkers and poets. The modern astrophysical world view, which began with Galileo, and its challenge to the adequacy of the senses to reveal reality, have left us a universe of whose qualities we know no more than the way they affect our measuring instruments, and—in the words of Eddington—\"the former have as much resemblance to the latter as a telephone number has to a subscriber.\" (As quoted by J.

Heisenberg's point is that the observed object has no existence independent of the observing subject: \"Durch die Art der Beobachtung wird entschieden, welche Züge der Natur bestimmt werden und welche wir durch unsere Beobachtungen verwischen\" (Wandlungen in den Grundlagen der Naturwissenschaft [1949], p. 67)."

All events were considered to be subject to a universally valid law in the fullest sense of the word, which means, among other things, valid beyond the reach of human sense experience (even of the sense experiences made with the help of the finest instruments), valid beyond the reach of human memory and the appearance of mankind on earth, valid even beyond the coming into existence of organic life and the earth herself.

It was rather the discovery, due to the new instrument, that Copernicus' image of \"the virile man standing in the sun … overlooking the planets\" was much more than an image or a gesture, was in fact an indication of the astounding human capacity to think in terms of the universe while remaining on the earth, and the perhaps even more astounding human ability to use cosmic laws as guiding principles for terrestrial action. Compared with the earth alienation underlying the whole development of natural science in the modern age, the withdrawal from terrestrial proximity contained in the discovery of the globe as a whole and the world alienation produced in the twofold process of expropriation and wealth accumulation are of minor significance."

It was rather the discovery, due to the new instrument, that Copernicus' image of \"the virile man standing in the sun . . . overlooking the planets\"19 was much more than an image or a gesture, was in fact an indication of the astounding human capacity to think in terms of the universe while remaining on the earth, and the perhaps even more astounding human ability to use cosmic laws as guiding principles for terrestrial action. Compared with the earth alienation underlying the whole development of natural science in the modern age, the withdrawal from terrestrial proximity contained in the discovery of the globe as a whole and the world alienation produced in the twofold process of expropriation and wealth accumulation are of minor significance."

Without actually standing where Archimedes wished to stand (…), still bound to the earth through the human condition, we have found a way to act on the earth and within terrestrial nature as though we [[dispose]] of it from outside, from the [[Archimedean Point]]. And even at the risk of endangering the natural life process we expose the earth to universal, cosmic forces alien to nature's household. >> dispose outside earth risk"
