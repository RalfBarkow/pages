      "text": "Fear built up each week.  The territory was terrifying.  Like crossing the wind-driven waves of a lake in an open canoe with my son, age 11, similar to Thompson's story of crossing the river with his son.  The trip across the 3000 foot/1000 meter reservoir in Northwestern Montana went quickly, with the wind at our backs.  Now, turning back, the wind was fierce, and the sun was dropping.  Fewer people were on the lake, which thankfully reduced the challenge of crossing the choppy wake of a motorboat, in addition to the ever-rising, wind-driven waves.  Each ten paddles got us marginally closer to shore.  Scanning the horizon for anyone who might see us if we capsized.  How long might we be able to hold out in this water?  Should we seek refuge on the opposite shore?  Labor Day weekend is already cold in Montana. Paddle on.  Grateful for the last few boats passing by, thinking about asking for help.  Paddle on.  Eventually, crossing over the current line of the reservoir.  Maybe we are halfway back.  Maybe another hour of paddling to go.  Maybe more.  Sunlight still on the mountain peaks in front of us, but not for much longer.  More wind.  Not raising alarms, but asking for my son's help.  We will need to do this together to get safely to shore.  Paddle, feather, adjust, paddle, feather, adjust.  Breathe, scan, look inward.  Breathe, scan, look inward.  Together, we are can face the winds, the waves, the cold water, the diminishing sunlight.  Each 10 paddles now getting us a bit closer.  If we had to, we might be able swim the remaining distance, but staying dry is our priority.  At last, we cross the broad eddy line, no longer battered by the wind.  We have several hundred yards yet to cover, but we will just reach shore as dusk falls.  An afternoon paddle across the lake is an adventure, not a folly.  A father's failings, in this moment, have no consequence, we have collectively averted disaster."

I can recall where I was as wrote various pieces, what lived experiences impacted those writings- streamside time in Baltimore with young people on a hot Saturday morning, time with my nephew talking about the future inspired Toppling Plantations, Spending time with my sister and speaking to my aunt connected to Networked Brains; hiking with my brother in Vermont brought out the reference to the hickory tree.  The variations on ubuntu came from our weekly call with our family in Kenya."

        "text": "Fear built up each week.  The territory was terrifying.  Like crossing the wind-driven waves of a lake in an open canoe with my son, age 11, similar to Thompson's story of crossing the river with his son.  The trip across the 3000 foot/1000 meter reservoir in Northwestern Montana went quickly, with the wind at our backs.  Now, turning back, the wind was fierce, and the sun was dropping.  Fewer people were on the lake, which thankfully reduced the challenge of crossing the choppy wake of a motorboat, in addition to the ever-rising, wind-driven waves.  Each ten paddles got us marginally closer to shore.  Scanning the horizon for anyone who might see us if we capsized.  How long might we be able to hold out in this water?  Should we seek refuge on the opposite shore?  Labor Day weekend is already cold in Montana. Paddle on.  Grateful for the last few boats passing by, thinking about asking for help.  Paddle on.  Eventually, crossing over the current line of the reservoir.  Maybe we are halfway back.  Maybe another hour of paddling to go.  Maybe more.  Sunlight still on the mountain peaks in front of us, but not for much longer.  More wind.  Not raising alarms, but asking for my son's help.  We will need to do this together to get safely to shore.  Paddle, feather, adjust, paddle, feather, adjust.  Breathe, scan, look inward.  Breathe, scan, look inward.  Together, we are can face the winds, the waves, the cold water, the diminishing sunlight.  Each 10 paddles now getting us a bit closer.  If we had to, we might be able swim the remaining distance, but staying dry is our priority.  At last, we cross the broad eddy line, no longer battered by the wind.  We have several hundred yards yet to cover, but we will just reach shore as dusk falls.  An afternoon paddle across the lake is an adventure, not a folly.  A father's failings, in this moment, have no consequence, we have collectively averted disaster."

My son was quick to say that in this situation, we were never in danger of losing our lives, just uncomfortable.  I remain grateful for his bright memory of the experience and attitude about the world.  May we all move so brightly through the world, and face our discomfort together."
