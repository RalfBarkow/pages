It contains the software and hardware in charge of importing data from different data sources (management and educational software of the institution, EdTech, LMS, etc.). The content imported to the ETL module can be of an encrypted and anonymized nature. Once stored, it cannot be identified by any entity but the users involved, i.e., using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption technology [62]. It can also be managed securely by employing secure connections, such as Secure Shell (SSH), Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Virtual Private Network (VPN). […] For instance, in the Moodle LMS, some of the authors managed to encrypt the user table since most of the personal data reside there and used a set of views that allow decryption or encryption at convenience. This measure can be complemented by ensuring students’ anonymity through second identities with the Protected Users plugin [32], thus not exporting data that can be used to identify people. The entire database can also be encrypted with a double user control system where not even the administrator can access or decrypt the data. Some of the authors of this paper conceived such a system and named it [[AuthChecker]] [35]; simple authentications, private and permissioned Application Program Interfaces (API), and Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) technologies are recommended to ensure data access by manually specified roles."
