I was sure that more than half of my code and effort was dealing with external (to the problem) file systems. What I really wanted was an unlimited workspace (much closer to available today, the MS Memory model is a good example).

There are certainly some difficulties with object systems, for sure - but they are more with the \"C\" criteria and not the \"D\" criteria. When the state is scattered all over the place, rather than confined within the database, insuring all invariants are satisfied is a nasty little problem.

But they, like filesystems, are an artifact of implementation mechanics, not the problem domain.

I was sure that more than half of my code and effort was dealing with external (to the problem) file systems. What I really wanted was an unlimited workspace (much closer to available today, the MS Memory model is a good example). With the addition of mechanisms to support persistence and interface, share, and exchange data with the outside world, we could get back to staying focused on solving the problem at hand. -- [[Jim Russell]]",

At any rate, are you suggesting that it is not possible to write an OO serialization management system (a mere \"library\" of any sort is insufficient to provide the \"D\" in ACID) which, if properly configured and administered, would provide an object-store with ACID semantics? There are certainly some difficulties with object systems, for sure - but they are more with the \"C\" criteria and not the \"D\" criteria. When the state is scattered all over the place, rather than confined within the database, insuring all invariants are satisfied is a nasty little problem. But avoiding data loss in the face of soft - and hard - failures is a problem with many known solutions; many of which don't involve a DBMS.
