        "text": "A [[Context Object]] binds all subsystems together because one object is referencing everything else. This is a [[Code Smell]]. Ideally, you should be able to load subsystems in independently of each other. A [[Context Object]] prevents this. A singleton is much better for this purpose. A singleton is not just for creating objects; it is also a service access point that can be loaded by the appropriate subsystem. Having a singleton represent every service access point allows for seamless vertical integration of cooperating components. A [[Context Object]"
