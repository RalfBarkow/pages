The history of the Puma infantry fighting vehicle, one of the Bundeswehr's prestige projects, is bizarre. The first plans date back to 1996, when a successor was sought for the aging standard \"Marder\" model. The first pre-production vehicles were delivered in 2006, but they soon turned out to be less than fully developed. Orders were nevertheless placed for the tank, which was manufactured by the defense companies Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall Landsysteme. In the years that followed, new deficiencies emerged and the project became increasingly expensive. In 2019, development and acquisition costs were estimated at around six billion euros, about double the original estimate. Meanwhile, the \"Puma\" is not only the heaviest infantry fighting vehicle in the world, but also one of the most expensive, costing 17 million euros each. Despite these huge sums, as recently as July 2020, a report by the Bundeswehr again found some significant defects and declared the tank unfit for service. It was not until a year later, in March 2021, that operational capability was finally determined. But because of the numerous upgrades, at least 266 units are not expected to be fully operational until 2027 - more than 30 years after initial planning began."

In order to replace obsolete naval supply ships, a German shipyard was commissioned to build two new tankers. Because the requested price of around 914 million euros was far above their expectations, the Bundeswehr accepted a worse equipment of the ships. As the research network of WDR, NDR and Süddeutsche Zeitung reported at the end of March, the price has not changed significantly as a result: The ships continue to be exorbitantly expensive, despite the poorer equipment. Even an internal review by experts from the Bundeswehr procurement office had concluded that the price was \"clearly excessive.\" According to an internal letter, a realistic price would have been about 250 million euros lower."

They start with ambitious specifications that become increasingly complex due to numerous special requests and changed requirement profiles. The industrial companies, in turn, make themselves pay dearly for every change. The tendency toward the so-called gold edge solution is often criticized: The German armed forces and government tend to be perfectionist in their specifications. The desired equipment is then often technically advanced, but long development times and high costs mean that in the end only small numbers can be produced and the tanks and aircraft delivered are often prone to failure."
