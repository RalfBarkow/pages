They start with ambitious specifications that become increasingly complex due to numerous special requests and changed requirement profiles. The industrial companies, in turn, make themselves pay dearly for every change. The tendency toward the so-called gold edge solution is often criticized: The German armed forces and government tend to be perfectionist in their specifications. The desired equipment is then often technically advanced, but long development times and high costs mean that in the end only small numbers can be produced and the tanks and aircraft delivered are often prone to failure."
