The notation for a 're-entry' must fulfill two conditions: first, it must be clear where the re-entry takes place, second, it must be clear which part of the expression should re-enter. Both is achieved by a direct connecting line with a 'cross' extended by a point. E1 can thus be written in new notation as follows: [...]. Both signs, which are not letters, are called 'marker' in the following, because in the interaction with the 're-entry' the 'cross' between a and b loses its function of being a boundary. Instead, both signs represent a common boundary. In the case of expressions with \"re-entry\", a \"cross\" is a \"marker\", but a \"marker\" does not necessarily have to be a \"cross\". \n\nThrough this graphical (and no longer typographical-linear) notation it becomes clear that 're-entry' expressions can be understood as networks. In a network all elements are related to each other, each element can get information from others. The areas distinguished by 'crosses' are thus interconnected, 'crosses' become elements of a network, markers. This character of networks becomes obvious in a new graphical representation of modulation functions."
