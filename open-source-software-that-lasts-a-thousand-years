The GitHub Archive Program's Jon Evans said, &quot;Our hope is that by storing and indexing millions of repositories, we have captured a valuable cross-section of the world of modern software.&quot; The archive is designed to last a millennium, with the snapshot stored on more than 180 film reels. A nearly 1.5-ton steel box contains the archive, and is decorated with artificial intelligence-generated etchings to entice future generations. Evans said the vault could potentially help someone who may need software that is otherwise lost, and also will serve as a historical record."
