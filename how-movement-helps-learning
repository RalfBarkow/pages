We wanted to work with the learning groups in the Bremgartenwald in Bern. Due to the shutdown, we were then no longer able to meet in person. We kept to the peripatetic format - but in compliance with the regulations on social distance. Students were given assignments to complete independently and on their own while walking around. Afterwards, there were opportunities for exchange on a digital learning platform. Many students reported back that it had been nice to work outside while walking, especially during the shutdown and the associated online study. During this time, many had to sit inside in front of the computer even more than usual. Overall, the feedback was very positive.\n\n"

I heard from students that they had to work harder than usual because of the many assignments during distance learning. Many have found the focus on the screen challenging. Teachers and learners alike have had to gain new experience in what the right dose and amount of material is.

        "text": "[[Katrin Seele]], \"Peripatetic teaching method\" sounds cryptic. What does one understand by it, simply explained?\n\nIt's about thinking while walking. Learning content is developed, discussed and reflected on while walking. Thus the method counts to the moved learning forms. Maybe some examples: It makes a difference whether you discuss passages about the \"gray gentlemen\" and the world of children in Michael Ende's novel \"Momo\" in a classroom, in a busy inner city, or in a dreary residential neighborhood. Or whether you deal with questions of animal ethics in a seminar room or on a walk through a zoo and come eye to eye with a primate monkey."

        "text": "And where does the name \"peripatetic\" come from?\n\nThe Greek verb peripatein means to wander. The name also alludes to the Peripatos, Aristotle's school in ancient Athens. In ancient times, much philosophizing, teaching and learning was done while walking. Almost all Socratic dialogues take place in the open air. And in the present, there are various moving teaching formats - in issue 7/2020, you portrayed \"promenadology.\" There are also approaches from school pedagogy that rely on moving learning games or movement breaks in the classroom - but in school, not at extracurricular learning sites. The peripatetic method emphasizes the philosophical tradition and focuses on the simultaneity of walking and thinking. The reflective linking of learning content and walking environment is the focus. Reflection thus becomes a holistic experience.\n"

Little text, because reading and writing while walking are uncomfortable. The peripatetic walk has fixed meeting points and times. In between, the participants walk either in groups or sometimes alone. They reflect and discuss while walking and with an alert look at their surroundings. Groups are fluid on the way, one can fall back or catch up with others by walking faster. A limited walking area is defined - this can be some streets in a neighborhood, certain forest paths, a park. The spatial limitation ensures that the paths of the groups cross on the way and that one can get into conversation with different people. The teacher is also a potential conversation partner along the way.\n\nA walk lasts 30 to 60 minutes. Ideally, you should not stop, but walk steadily. It is an important experience not to be able to write down or memorize everything immediately. Relying on your memory and taking the impressions \"in your head\" with you. And to trust that in the conversation after the end of the walk the most important insights can be remembered and noted down. Because at the end of each walk, there is a time container for discussion, securing results and time for notes.\n"

Particularly when you study humanities subjects, you deal with the whole colorful world described in the texts in terms of content - but you sit in the seminar room or at your desk yourself. That's why, 20 years ago, my husband and I started a student initiative called \"Die Peripatetiker\" (The Peripatetic) for reading and reflecting while walking. For example, we covered Heraclitus and his famous phrase \"Everything flows\" while walking by the river.\n\nLater, while working in high school, I wanted to try out whether the way we read and philosophized while walking outside as students would also work in an institutionalized way in school. That was the beginning of the peripatetic form of teaching.\n"
