Whether or not it is a conscious process, each observer defines the system under consideration: its purpose, its boundaries, and other relevant characteristics.\n\n\nObservers change systems to a greater or lesser extent as they observe them. This phenomena may be immediate and substantial as in the case of a social scientist studying worker behavior, or indirect and subtle as in the case of physical sciences. An example of the former comes from Roethlisberger’s experiments varying factors such as lighting to measure the effects on worker productivity. He and his associates found improvements when the light levels were increased, and still more improvement when they were decreased, until it was practically dark. This has been called the Hawthorne effect after the Westinghouse Hawthorne plant where experiments were conducted. Another example comes from atomic physics where physicist Werner Heisenberg found limits on the accuracy of measurement imposed by die act and the means of observation. This phenomenon is referred to as the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\n\nDifferent observers in the same situation may look around them and share perceptions of a system or systems with others to a greater or lesser extent. Observers necessarily operate in an atmosphere of uncertainty because the outcome of most observed events is governed by laws of probability and statistics. When two or more observers see the same 'system' with partially corresponding purposes and characteristics, or a single observer looks at the same system from different experimental approaches and sees overlapping but not identical pictures, models of the system will be conceived which reveal somewhat different findings. In physics, this is a commonly experienced phenomenon called complementarity."
