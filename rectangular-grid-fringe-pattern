      "text": "The visibility of the fringe grid pattern, when projected on an object, is greatest for matte reflecting surfaces; […] The topographic information is clearly coded into the distortions of the grid pattern as it is projected on these surfaces. Numerical metrological values can be conveniently retrieved by projecting a calibrated orthogonal set of axes (deduced from the relative angles of the grid pattern and camera axis) onto a photograph of the object and pattern. In principle, since the fringe spatial frequency can be increased with beam-contracting optics, studies of objects ranging to microscopic size can be performed; the only limitation may be the coherent modulation transfer function of the optical components."

Numerical metrological values can be conveniently retrieved by projecting a calibrated orthogonal set of axes (deduced from the relative angles of the grid pattern and camera axis) onto a photograph of the object and pattern. In principle, since the fringe spatial frequency can be increased with beam-contracting optics, studies of objects ranging to microscopic size can be performed; the only limitation may be the coherent modulation transfer function of the optical components."
