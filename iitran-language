One of the quirks of the job submission process is that input flow control was achieved by the system's echo of X-OFF characters we typed at the end of every line.

Unfortunately, the echo delay turned out to be unbounded and the very occasional very long display would cause lost characters and another day lost debugging a program. We developed the practice of holding repeat and punching a second or so of RUBOUTs to make sure the X-OFF had time to echo before the characters of the next line were read and lost. -- [[Ward Cunningham]]",
