One of the key innovations of Lisp was the incorporation of lambda calculus, which is a mathematical notation for expressing functions and their evaluations.\n\nSpecifically, Lisp incorporated the concept of a lambda function, which is a way of defining an anonymous function. This allowed Lisp to support higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as values. This made Lisp a powerful language for expressing complex algorithms and data structures, and it helped to establish functional programming as a programming paradigm.\n\nThe use of lambda calculus in Lisp also contributed to the development of Lisp's distinctive syntax. In particular, Lisp's use of parentheses to represent expressions and function calls, also known as S-expression syntax, was influenced by the notation used in lambda calculus.\n\nOverall, the influence of lambda calculus on the development of Lisp was fundamental to the language's success. Lisp's use of lambda functions and higher-order functions helped to establish functional programming as a core programming paradigm, and its distinctive syntax made it a powerful language for expressing complex algorithms and data structures."
