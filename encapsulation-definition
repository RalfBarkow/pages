This is an important property of objects, but it is not unique to them. The ideas of black-box operation and of 'information hiding' are common to many forms of component-based systems development. The second meaning of encapsulation is that something exemplifies the essential features of something else, as in 'this document encapsulates our marketing strategy'.

This is an important property of objects, but it is not unique to them. The ideas of black-box operation and of 'information hiding' are common to many forms of component-based systems development. The second meaning of encapsulation is that something exemplifies the essential features of something else, as in 'this document encapsulates our marketing strategy'. This second meaning - which corresponds to the principle of behavioural completeness - is far more important in the context of object-oriented modelling.",
