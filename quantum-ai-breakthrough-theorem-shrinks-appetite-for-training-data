Coles said quantum AI training occurs in a mathematical construct called a Hilbert space, and the theorem shows that navigating this space requires only as many data points as the number of parameters in a given model. The researchers could ensure that a quantum model can be compiled in far fewer computational gates relative to the volume of data. LANL's Marco Cerezo said, &quot;We can compile certain very large quantum operations within minutes with very few training points&#8212;something that was not previously possible.&quot;"
