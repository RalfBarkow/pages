In a state of shock I didn't have the opportunity to defend myself, or even respond in any way. This incident caused me shame and embarrassment, and I withdrew.  I now wonder if I had not been so stunned, and had got a shot back at this fellow student I had not even met, if my path might have been a different one. The idea of [[Sliding Doors]] is a compelling one."

Away from school I found solace in activities that were solitary; building model planes, breeding Australian finches, and behind the camera. A lasting interest in wildlife photography and my concern for the environment grew from this interest in photography."

It was one way I tried to connect to my father, who excelled in sports. While I certainly felt loved by Dad, I didn't feel like I lived up to his expectations of me on the field. I was slow to develop and even when selected at representative level it is fair to say that I lacked the type of confidence and aggression needed to succeed in this contact sport.\n\n"

In a state of shock I didn't have the opportunity to defend myself, or even respond in any way. This incident caused me shame and embarrassment, and I withdrew.  I now wonder if I had not been so stunned, and had got a shot back at this fellow student I had not even met, if my path might have been a different one. The idea of [[Sliding Doors]] is a compelling one."

Being in the football team carried some kudos and a new confidence related to sport emerged for me in the senior secondary years. In a way I was seen in a way that I hadn't been noticed at high school to that point."

A lasting interest in wildlife photography and my concern for the environment grew from this interest in photography."

It was one way I tried to connect to my father, who excelled in sports. While I certainly felt loved by Dad, I didn't feel like I lived up to his expectations of me on the field. I was slow to develop and even when selected at representative level it is fair to say that I lacked the type of confidence and aggression needed to succeed in this contact sport.\n\n"
