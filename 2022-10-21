My feeling right now is that those upper layer abstractions can be very easily implemented at the same time the requirements for those could be widely different from one application to another so it might be better for developers to make up rather than Croquet dictates how it should be done.  As for the wire and node idea, though, I think publish and subscribe may not cover what is actually needed. In my past lives I was playing with functional reactive programming and dataflow languages, and one key there is that you want to have a sound dependency graph in that computation model.

If you implement this kind of propagation with publish and subscribe, one node would receive multiple events at one logical time, and it'd publish multiple events and the results would not have well formed state.

That is the case. It was implemented as a simple non-synced videos (and we still have VideoManager that handles global click to try to start videos). But yeah, we removed it from the docs as we don't want to have unsynced video.\nclearly, THUYDOAN (she/her) â€” 15.08.2022\nvoila: it's possible with a new video asset in the directory. https://www.loom.com/share/b2219d9a485247dba7bb776e4a48911c\n\nnext i'm gonna attempt to make the video source a video tag instead of an asset we add to /assets/videos/[video] :cutedevil: probably gotta franken stein some three.js docs on video textures with the current card implementation. i'm guessing instead of making the video texture source the textureLocation that was passed, make it grab a video tag by an id in some html file ðŸ¤” \n\nthis is all for fun so no pressure here. i'm mainly trying to see if i can stream a live video within croquet's microverse builder. baby steps to the end goal. \nLoom\n?world=mux&q=4ob42zrgve#pw=vDXJvCQQqZaxjnhUD6Mbqw - 15 August 2022\nyoshiki â€” 15.08.2022\nA file in the worlds directory is considered a template. If you start a fresh session either not specify the ?q= parameter and letting the system create a random one, or you supply one that had never used before, the template is used to populate the world.  But if you modify the template afterwards, and reloading a page with the same ?q= value, it continues to go with the state that is already created.\ncodefrau ðŸ¦© â€” 15.08.2022\nOh yeah live video would be already sort-of synchronized. Should be fun!\nyoshiki â€” 15.08.2022\nSave and Load of the three bar menu are probably confusing. We will reorganize the menu soon.\nclearly, THUYDOAN (she/her) â€” 15.08.2022\nspeaking of video, i read a fun thing in the croquet docs. that croquet os is extremely low latency. how low latency are we talking?\ncodefrau ðŸ¦© â€” 15.08.2022\nDepends on your distance to the nearest reflector. Here in LA we get under 10ms. With an on premises reflector it would be even lower. Itâ€™s lower latency than traditional client/server because there is essentially no processing delay on the server, because your app does not run on the server.\nclearly, THUYDOAN (she/her) â€” 15.08.2022\ni wonder how significant the dif in latency would be from say, New York :thinkxel: but that's pretty neat.\ncodefrau ðŸ¦© â€” 15.08.2022\nWhat latency do you get? It should pick one of our East Coast clusters (we do have reflectors around the world) \nclearly, THUYDOAN (she/her) â€” 15.08.2022\nlooks like 20-30ms in my region :partycat: \ncodefrau ðŸ¦© â€” 15.08.2022\nNot bad. Depends on your ISP and their connectivity to our data center too.\nDennis â€” 17.08.2022\nHi Thuy - Were you able to stream a live video to a card in the Microverse?  Or did you use a static video?  It would be interesting to have a template card that enables streaming content from the Mux platform directly to a card in the Microverse."

It would play at a different timestamp on every client though\nclearly, THUYDOAN (she/her) â€” 15.08.2022\no wait something promising in card.js\n\n        if (textureType === \"video\") {\n            this.video = document.createElement('video');\ncodefrau ðŸ¦© â€” 15.08.2022\n... maybe it's implemented but not documented because it works unsynced?\nclearly, THUYDOAN (she/her) â€” 15.08.2022\npossible! i'll play around. thanks Vanessa ðŸ™‚\nyoshiki â€” 15.08.2022\nAnd yes. That is the case. It was implemented as a simple non-synced videos (and we still have VideoManager that handles global click to try to start videos). But yeah, we removed it from the docs as we don't want to have unsynced video.\nclearly, THUYDOAN (she/her) â€” 15.08.2022\nvoila: it's possible with a new video asset in the directory. https://www.loom.com/share/b2219d9a485247dba7bb776e4a48911c\n\nnext i'm gonna attempt to make the video source a video tag instead of an asset we add to /assets/videos/[video] :cutedevil: probably gotta franken stein some three.js docs on video textures with the current card implementation. i'm guessing instead of making the video texture source the textureLocation that was passed, make it grab a video tag by an id in some html file ðŸ¤” \n\nthis is all for fun so no pressure here. i'm mainly trying to see if i can stream a live video within croquet's microverse builder. baby steps to the end goal. \nLoom\n?world=mux&q=4ob42zrgve#pw=vDXJvCQQqZaxjnhUD6Mbqw - 15 August 2022\nyoshiki â€” 15.08.2022\nA file in the worlds directory is considered a template. If you start a fresh session either not specify the ?q= parameter and letting the system create a random one, or you supply one that had never used before, the template is used to populate the world.  But if you modify the template afterwards, and reloading a page with the same ?q= value, it continues to go with the state that is already created.\ncodefrau ðŸ¦© â€” 15.08.2022\nOh yeah live video would be already sort-of synchronized. Should be fun!\nyoshiki â€” 15.08.2022\nSave and Load of the three bar menu are probably confusing. We will reorganize the menu soon.\nclearly, THUYDOAN (she/her) â€” 15.08.2022\nspeaking of video, i read a fun thing in the croquet docs. that croquet os is extremely low latency. how low latency are we talking?\ncodefrau ðŸ¦© â€” 15.08.2022\nDepends on your distance to the nearest reflector. Here in LA we get under 10ms. With an on premises reflector it would be even lower. Itâ€™s lower latency than traditional client/server because there is essentially no processing delay on the server, because your app does not run on the server.\nclearly, THUYDOAN (she/her) â€” 15.08.2022\ni wonder how significant the dif in latency would be from say, New York :thinkxel: but that's pretty neat.\ncodefrau ðŸ¦© â€” 15.08.2022\nWhat latency do you get? It should pick one of our East Coast clusters (we do have reflectors around the world) \nclearly, THUYDOAN (she/her) â€” 15.08.2022\nlooks like 20-30ms in my region :partycat: \ncodefrau ðŸ¦© â€” 15.08.2022\nNot bad. Depends on your ISP and their connectivity to our data center too.\nDennis â€” 17.08.2022\nHi Thuy - Were you able to stream a live video to a card in the Microverse?  Or did you use a static video?  It would be interesting to have a template card that enables streaming content from the Mux platform directly to a card in the Microverse."
