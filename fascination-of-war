Anyone who goes to the cinema can trust that a screenwriter or director has taken responsibility for this change. Therefore, he can still distance himself inwardly and wait for the happy ending. Someone who bungee jumps relies on the rope holding, but what he or she experiences is \"the real thing,\" the adrenaline rush that doesn't just come from identifying with some fictional hero. The separation between [[Fact]] and [[Fiction]] is eliminated. In a macabre way, this re-entry of the observer into the picture was accomplished in the Twin Towers, where some people on the upper floors watched on television – inevitably more or less distanced – how an airplane flew into the tower they were sitting in. The distinction between observer and actor was erased, the boundary between inside and outside dissolved. The nightmare of the spectator became true …"

In classical antiquity, too, the Olympic Games were suspended during times of war. When real warfare is fought for survival, there is no need to replace it with simulated forms of war in sport or film. Thus, it is fair to say that sports (at least martial arts) and forms of entertainment that follow the pattern of heroic myths are the continuation of war by other means (sometimes vice versa).
