When the Russian autocracy cracked down on the Ukrainian movement in the mid-1970s, he was forced into exile, first to Switzerland and later to Bulgaria. In Geneva, Drahomanov published the first Ukrainian socialist journal, [[Hromada]]. Drahomanov leaned toward Bakunin rather than Marx, unlike some of his closest allies. Serhij Podolynskyj, for example, corresponded with Marx, and Mykola Ziber (Nikolaj Sieber in another transcription) wrote a long treatise on Marx's Das Kapital. Drahomanov was a consistent opponent of the early manifestations of Ukrainian ethnonationalism. He never combined his pro-Ukrainian sympathies with antipathies against other nationalities of Ukraine, though he criticized chauvinist tendencies in the Polish and Russian revolutionary movements."

One of the Ukrainian students he convinced to embrace socialism was the poet, writer, and scholar Ivan Franko, often considered one of the greats of Ukrainian literature, surpassed only by the national poet Taras Shevchenko. The Galician socialists founded the Radical Party in 1890, based on the peasantry. Drahomanov wrote regularly for their newspaper Narod (The People) until his untimely death in 1895 at the age of 53. Before the end of the decade, younger radicals split from the party and formed the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party, which adhered to Austromarxism. The radicals supported strikes by Ukrainian farm workers, and the annual May Day demonstration in Lviv drew large crowds."

They welcomed the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, and from their ranks were recruited the founders of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine."

In the 1990s, however, Ukrainian students began to revive political activities and in 1900 founded the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party. This was quite diffuse ideologically and split into several parties in 1904, including the Ukrainian Social Democratic Workers' Party (USDA) and the Ukrainian Social Democratic Spilka (Union). Both parties were Marxist but disagreed on the nationality question. Disagreements over what value should be placed on nationality were a chronic source of tension in the Ukrainian socialist movement. Lev Yurkevich - a co-founder, Central Committee member, and theoretician of the USDA - held positions close to Lenin's but polemicized against him on the nationality question."

Like the Russian Social Revolutionaries, its members were socialists who advocated a peasant revolution rather than a workers revolution. The Ukrainian Social Democrats and the Social Revolutionaries formed the main forces in the Ukrainian Centralna Rada, the revolutionary parliament of Ukraine in Kiev (the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic, founded in 1917, was the first Ukrainian nation-state, ed.). Conflicts between the Rada and the Bolsheviks broke out as early as 1917, but some Ukrainian revolutionaries formed pro-Bolshevik groups, namely the Borotbists (a left-wing split from the Social Revolutionaries) and the Independent Ukrainian Social Democratic Workers' Party. After the Bolsheviks' victory in the Civil War, most Ukrainian territories that had been part of the Russian Empire were integrated into the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. All Ukrainian parties except the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) were banned."

Galicia, which had formerly belonged to Austria, and Volhynia, which had previously been under the Russian Empire, had been annexed by Poland. In the 1920s, many Ukrainians in Galicia sympathized with the Soviet Union and followed events in Soviet Ukraine with great interest. While Ukrainians were discriminated against in Poland, Ukrainian cultural, research, and educational institutions developed in Soviet Ukraine with state support. Quite a few Galician Ukrainian intellectuals therefore made the mistake of migrating to Soviet Ukraine to find work that suited their talents, for example, in research institutions or encyclopedia projects. They were murdered by the Stalinist regime in the 1930s. In Volhynia, where there was only a thinner layer of educated Ukrainians as a result of earlier tsarist policies, socialist ideas remained a powerful force among the peasantry until the 1930s."

Prominent leaders of the so-called national communists, such as the Commissioner for Education, Mykola Skrypnyk, and the proletarian writer Mykola Chwylowyj, were driven to suicide.

Socialist parties persisted, but they were horrified by what they learned about events in the Ukrainian territories just across the Soviet border. A tiny left-wing Communist and National Communist group published a journal in Lviv for a brief period in the thirties. In 1939, as a result of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, the Soviet Union annexed western Ukraine, that is, the territories of Galicia and Volhynia in Poland. All political parties were dissolved or dissolved themselves, and they did not resume their activities even under the Nazi occupation (1941-1944). The only political organization that survived both Soviet and Nazi rule was the right-wing Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). It could draw on a long experience of conspiratorial underground work. But even before the Soviet police and army began arresting the nationalists, the NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, forerunner of the KGB, ed.) had persecuted and executed the dissident communists who still remained on the territory of western Ukraine."

He had become a socialist in his youth in the Drahomanov circle in Lviv and had been one of the founding members of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, as well as one of the small groups of left communists active in Polish-ruled Galicia in the 1930s. When the Red Army occupied Western Ukraine in 1939, he fled to Krakow in the German zone. He was arrested for helping Jews who had escaped from the ghetto and taken to Auschwitz for it. After the war, he moved to Detroit and worked on a brilliant interpretation of Marx's economic thought, \"The Making of Marx's Capital.\" His interpretation was based on a careful comparison of the \"Grundrisse\" with \"Capital.\" He also wrote an important work on the national question, \"Friedrich Engels and the Problem of 'Historyless' Peoples - The National Question in the Revolution of 1848.\" Rosdolskyj had grown up in a region where the Ukrainian, Polish, German and Russian languages were equally in use, which is why he was able to work with the classic texts of Marxism, be they by Marx and Engels, Lenin or Rosa Luxemburg, in the original."

Inspired by the American antiwar movement and by radical politics in the United States and Canada, a group of young Ukrainians in Canada published the Ukrainian-language journal [[Diialoh]] in the 1970s, whose motto was \"Socialism and Democracy in an Independent Ukraine.\" It appeared from 1977 to 1987.

A notable testimony to this is Ivan Dzyuba's book \"Internationalism or Russification?\" which he wrote in 1965; it was published in London in 1968 and spread throughout Ukraine in manuscript or pirated form. It is a Marxist critique of post-Stalinist Soviet nationalities policy. The mathematician Leonid Plyushch was arrested as a dissident in 1972. Soviet authorities locked him up in a mental institution and drugged him. A major campaign in the West for his release led to his being allowed to leave for France in 1976. There he wrote his memoirs, \"In the Carnival of History. A Life as a Dissident in Soviet Reality,\" in which he described his imprisonment and advocated humanist Marxism."

According to his analysis, class and language group membership tended to coincide in Ukrainian territories: The major landowners were Poles, Russians, or Russophone ethnic Ukrainians; the artisans and merchants were primarily Jews, largely traditional-religious and Yiddish-speaking. The peasants, however, who made up the vast majority of the population in this \"breadbasket of Europe,\" spoke Ukrainian and, according to Drahomanov, maintained a culture distinct from the other nationalities. Thus, according to Drahomanov, the peasants were to form the social base of the Ukrainian movement, and the intelligentsia, educated in Russian or Polish, would have the task of learning to write Ukrainian in order to spread the ideas of enlightenment and progress in the countryside."

One of the Ukrainian students he convinced to embrace socialism was the poet, writer, and scholar Ivan Franko, often considered one of the greats of Ukrainian literature, surpassed only by the national poet Taras Shevchenko. The Galician socialists founded the Radical Party in 1890, based on the peasantry. Drahomanov wrote regularly for their newspaper Narod (The People) until his untimely death in 1895 at the age of 53. Before the end of the decade, younger radicals split from the party and formed the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party, which adhered to Austromarxism. The radicals supported strikes by Ukrainian farm workers, and the annual May Day demonstration in Lviv drew large crowds."

Conflicts between the Rada and the Bolsheviks broke out as early as 1917, but some Ukrainian revolutionaries formed pro-Bolshevik groups, namely the Borotbists (a left-wing split from the Social Revolutionaries) and the Independent Ukrainian Social Democratic Workers' Party. After the Bolsheviks' victory in the Civil War, most Ukrainian territories that had been part of the Russian Empire were integrated into the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. All Ukrainian parties except the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) were banned."

Galicia, which had formerly belonged to Austria, and Volhynia, which had previously been under the Russian Empire, had been annexed by Poland. In the 1920s, many Ukrainians in Galicia sympathized with the Soviet Union and followed events in Soviet Ukraine with great interest. While Ukrainians were discriminated against in Poland, Ukrainian cultural, research, and educational institutions developed in Soviet Ukraine with state support. Quite a few Galician Ukrainian intellectuals therefore made the mistake of migrating to Soviet Ukraine to find work that suited their talents, for example, in research institutions or encyclopedia projects. They were murdered by the Stalinist regime in the 1930s. In Volhynia, where there was only a thinner layer of educated Ukrainians as a result of earlier tsarist policies, socialist ideas remained a powerful force among the peasantry until the 1930s."

A tiny left-wing Communist and National Communist group published a journal in Lviv for a brief period in the thirties. In 1939, as a result of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, the Soviet Union annexed western Ukraine, that is, the territories of Galicia and Volhynia in Poland. All political parties were dissolved or dissolved themselves, and they did not resume their activities even under the Nazi occupation (1941-1944). The only political organization that survived both Soviet and Nazi rule was the right-wing Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). It could draw on a long experience of conspiratorial underground work. But even before the Soviet police and army began arresting the nationalists, the NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, forerunner of the KGB, ed.) had persecuted and executed the dissident communists who still remained on the territory of western Ukraine."

        "text": "Although socialist activity on Ukrainian territory had largely ended after the 1920s, there was one notable Ukrainian socialist who managed to survive both the persecution of the Soviet period and the Nazi period, and who eventually died in Detroit in 1967, Roman Rosdolskyj. He had become a socialist in his youth in the Drahomanov circle in Lviv and had been one of the founding members of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, as well as one of the small groups of left communists active in Polish-ruled Galicia in the 1930s. When the Red Army occupied Western Ukraine in 1939, he fled to Krakow in the German zone. He was arrested for helping Jews who had escaped from the ghetto and taken to Auschwitz for it. After the war, he moved to Detroit and worked on a brilliant interpretation of Marx's economic thought, \"The Making of Marx's Capital.\" His interpretation was based on a careful comparison of the \"Grundrisse\" with \"Capital.\" He also wrote an important work on the national question, \"Friedrich Engels and the Problem of 'Historyless' Peoples - The National Question in the Revolution of 1848.\" Rosdolskyj had grown up in a region where the Ukrainian, Polish, German and Russian languages were equally in use, which is why he was able to work with the classic texts of Marxism, be they by Marx and Engels, Lenin or Rosa Luxemburg, in the original."

Inspired by the American antiwar movement and by radical politics in the United States and Canada, a group of young Ukrainians in Canada published the Ukrainian-language journal Diialoh in the 1970s, whose motto was \"Socialism and Democracy in an Independent Ukraine.\" It appeared from 1977 to 1987.

        "text": "Socialist thought also shaped some of the dissidents who were persecuted in Soviet Ukraine. A notable testimony to this is Ivan Dzyuba's book \"Internationalism or Russification?\" which he wrote in 1965; it was published in London in 1968 and spread throughout Ukraine in manuscript or pirated form. It is a Marxist critique of post-Stalinist Soviet nationalities policy. The mathematician Leonid Plyushch was arrested as a dissident in 1972. Soviet authorities locked him up in a mental institution and drugged him. A major campaign in the West for his release led to his being allowed to leave for France in 1976. There he wrote his memoirs, \"In the Carnival of History. A Life as a Dissident in Soviet Reality,\" in which he described his imprisonment and advocated humanist Marxism."
