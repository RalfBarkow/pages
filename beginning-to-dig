Thompson spoke to us about a unique learning framework and experiments using it in a rural school in Dayton. He explained the Designed inGenuity (DiG) learning framework to us briefly before articulating that it was best experienced in order to be deeply understood. And so we began our first 'DiG'."

It’s a world where your survival is based on how fast you’re innovating, and where the economy is a creative one.
