Like Vogl, we can assume that after 2006, policymakers, with their billion-dollar support programs, were held hostage by commercial banks that no longer saw through their own Ponzi schemes. But we can also assume that these Ponzi schemes of securitized loans and loan packages were, for their part, an attempt to implement the policy of an American central bank that was trying to promote real estate ownership by the American middle class with a massive increase in the money supply."

What this is due to is not so easy to say. Certainly, in both cases one is dealing with theories of reflection, which do not have to question the functionality of their subject areas, but to prove it. Therefore, economic theories concentrate on the proof of allocative efficiency and the correction of allocative inefficiency, while political theories are concerned with legitimation procedures and legitimacy deficits. In one case, the focus is on the factual dimension, in the other on the social dimension of meaning production. In the perhaps very \"modern\" hope that the division of labor will succeed, both the dependence of one dimension on the other is obscured and the third dimension, the time dimension of meaning, is neglected. >> meaning factual dimension social time"

But this is done at the price of new blind spots, as we know. Consumers, markets, and managers do not appear in Marx's diagram. But they belong in the diagram just as much as the financial system, which has been the focus of capitalism theory since Hilferding, and the consumption of non-renewable resources, to which ecological movements, climate and biodiversity researchers alike draw attention. They belong in the diagram because the sovereignty effects that Vogl analyzes also draw their persistence from their vectors. They bring into play a factual and social turbulence that first forces us both to think of the future as unknown and to make this very idea the dominant integrating figure of all the calculations involved. Far from being able to fix this future by whatever speculation, it becomes more uncertain by every bet on it."

Rather, since the end of the nineteenth century, the coinage of the term has been linked to a historical way of problematizing that includes not only economic forms, corporate structures, and property relations but also political, cultural, and mentality-historical parameters (p. 116). Vogl gives the term a \"diagrammatic\" contour (p. 102 et passim) that is able to reckon with heterogeneity, nonlinearity, and complexity. This makes it possible to use the tools of cultural studies, that is, a combination of historical-genealogical and narrative-discourse analytical knowledge, to reconstruct the singular shape of a financial system that does not necessarily have to be called, this would be my objection, \"capitalist.\" For the concept of capitalism cannot be had without the critique of its inherent political economy. This critique is no longer only, with Kant, the examination of the conditions of a possibility, but, with Marx and Foucault, the attempt \"not to be governed in such a way.\" If one understands capitalism with Vogl as an attempt to \"transform future riches into present profits and capitalize unforeseeable futures\" (p. 250), and as a functional condition of the reproduction of domination - \"As an elementary capitalist mode of action, investments transfer funds in order to reproduce social relations of dependence and structures of obligation\" (p. 117) this turn of critique into the rejection of the relations cannot be avoided. And there are enough reasons to reject the relations. What is in question, however, is whether the historical singularity whose story is told here can rather be broken down to the difference of domination and dependence or to that of present and future. \"Capital\" can be defined vis-à-vis \"labor\" as exploitation or vis-à-vis \"future\" as provision. One is historically diagrammatically intertwined with the other. And political as well as economic calculations use the possibility of threatening violence because the future is uncertain, and promising a fortune if one provides the necessary resources to that threat and the willingness to yield to it. But is this, [[Dirk Baecker]] repeats himself, capitalism or society? If it were capitalism, one would have to assume that things could be done differently, but that the opponent has the better cards. If it is society, one would have to assume that there is no other way, but that the cards are always redistributed between politics and business, law and science, art and religion, taking into account the respective current balance of power.\n Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)"

But this is done at the price of new blind spots, as we know. Consumers, markets, and managers do not appear in Marx's diagram. But they belong in the diagram just as much as the financial system, which has been the focus of capitalism theory since Hilferding, and the consumption of non-renewable resources, to which ecological movements, climate and biodiversity researchers alike draw attention. They belong in the diagram because the sovereignty effects that Vogl analyzes also draw their persistence from their vectors. They bring into play a factual and social turbulence that first forces us both to think of the future as unknown and to make this very idea the dominant integrating figure of all the calculations involved. Far from being able to fix this future by whatever speculation, it becomes more uncertain by every bet on it."
