A citizen asks a Zen monk why is it that Liu Bang is considered a powerful leader if all of his advisers are smarter and stronger than he is?\n>\nThe Zen monk replies:\n>\n“‘Why is it that two wheels made of identical spokes differ in strength?’ asked the master. ‘See beyond what is seen. Never forget that the wheel is made not only of spokes, but also of the space between the spokes. \n>\nSturdy spokes poorly placed make a weak wheel. Whether their full potential is realized depends on the harmony between them. \n>\nThe essence of wheel-making lies in the craftman’s ability to conceive and create the space that holds and balances the spokes within the wheel.'” [https://www.theemotionmachine.com/10-lessons-in-zen-leadership-practiced-by-legendary-coach-phil-jackson/ source]\n"

A citizen asks a Zen monk why is it that Liu Bang is considered a powerful leader if all of his advisers are smarter and stronger than he is?\n>\nThe Zen monk replies:\n>\n“‘Why is it that two wheels made of identical spokes differ in strength?’ asked the master. ‘See beyond what is seen. Never forget that the wheel is made not only of spokes, but also of the space between the spokes. \n>\nSturdy spokes poorly placed make a weak wheel. Whether their full potential is realized depends on the harmony between them. \n>\nThe essence of wheel-making lies in the craftman’s ability to conceive and create the space that holds and balances the spokes within the wheel.'” [https://www.theemotionmachine.com/10-lessons-in-zen-leadership-practiced-by-legendary-coach-phil-jackson/ web]"
