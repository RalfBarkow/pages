This is a paradoxical or, if you will, utopian movement that means excluding the environment and including it again. If you think of this against the background of a sum-constancy premise, it would be a nonsensical maneuver, a back and forth with no effect, but if you think of complexity as an incremental variable - and this is precisely why I am combining the rationality discussion and the complexity discussion - then you can imagine that a system with, let's say, tested rationality and tested complexity operates differently and is organized differently than simpler systems that do not have this evolution or this planning behind them. That is, one can imagine that among the complexity patterns-you remember that these are always selection patterns-there are those that are better suited to making irritations from the environment processable in the system."

Only by the fact that plans are not fulfilled? You don't even know why they're not being fulfilled, but they're not being fulfilled, so you have to put on top or cut back or whatever? Or is there a sensitivity to highly aggregated economic data - the origin of which is not so well known either, but the economic institutes are considered reliable - about unemployment, inflation, the external value of the currency, to which one responds with a policy for which one can emphasize various policy options? Not under the conditions of state planning, but under the conditions of open sensitivity to economic indicators of going well or going badly, one can imagine a democratic opposition. Because then you can say that you think the situation is threatening or temporary and that you propose Keynesian instruments or think that the market will help itself, you just have to be patient and watch.

If all this is true! I am formulating this now only as a model to show that there are possible solutions which react more strongly to complex environmental situations which they themselves did not create and which do not just note the effects of their own activities - \"What we wanted cannot be done or is being done or is not being done\" - but which can develop a kind of sensorium for problems which are independent of them. In terms of the economy, this would mean that political rationality grows as system rationality, as the property of the political system to take note of and be able to process more environmental states.

Can the legal system juridify, i.e. introduce into the legal process, a change in society through general institutes such as property, contract, constitutional law and fundamental rights? Is the legal system rigid because the paragraphs are textually fixed, so that it can only register unlawful versus lawful? Or is the way legal terms are formulated, institutes made, and procedures laid out capable of making more information legally relevant given texts? For example, compared to the early modern period or even the Middle Ages, we have much more sophisticated procedures for testing subjective facts. In the past, it would have been an impossible idea to consider the will of the person making the contract legally relevant, because it would not have been possible to determine the will or the motives at all. With the type of procedures we have today, however, we dare to do this, however well it is done then."

From (bio-)chemical point of view we may wish to know when an autocatalytic reaction with rate k can be assumed as instantaneous. In practice, we may assume that the reaction is instantaneous if its rate is such that the corresponding H-distance (between the logistic and the step function) is less than the precision of the measurement instruments used in the experiment. To achieve our goal we obtain new sharper estimates for the H-distance between a step function and its best approximating logistic function."
