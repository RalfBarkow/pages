This science has been around for more than 100 years and, after World War II, received widespread recognition thanks to Nobel Prize winners such as Konrad Lorenz, Nikolaas Tinbergen, and Karl von Frisch. My own definition of ethology is that it is “the science that, using the perspective of evolution, investigates how and why a specific behavior develops and what drives that behavior.” The society in which we live today has, from an evolutionary perspective, only been around for a very short time and differs markedly from the world of many million years ago in which our behavior originated."
