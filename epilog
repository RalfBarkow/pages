In other words: What would be the world experience of a human being who would be able to see his world as his own construction? This person would be, as Varela already stated (p. 309), above all tolerant. Who has grasped that his world is his own invention, must grant this to the worlds of his fellow men. He who knows that he is not right, but that his view of things fits only right and wrong, will find it difficult to ascribe malice or madness to his fellow men and to persist in the primitive thinking of the Manichean \"He who is not for me is against me\". The insight that we know nothing as long as we do not know that we know nothing definitively is the precondition of respect for the realities invented by other people. Only when these other realities themselves become intolerant would he claim – again in Karl Popper's meaning – the right not to tolerate intolerance."

And this sound was directed at me; I was in connection with this sound and did not doubt in the least that something decisive was going to happen to me. Not a single thought in me was of the kind that is supposed to occur in the moments of parting with life, but everything I felt was directed toward the future; and I simply must say, I was sure to feel God's nearness near my body in the next minute. [...] My heart beat broadly and calmly; I could not have been frightened even for a fraction of a second; not the smallest particle of time was missing from my life.

And yet, by their very nature, one cannot deny their mystical character, since in them the subject-object split obviously closes - even if only for seconds. The problem is only their description. The so-called mystics either fall into silence - as Wittgenstein recommends - or they are forced to use the language of the great models of their respective epoch; religion, mythology, philosophy and the like. In the incomparable simplicity of his style, Lao-tzu expresses this dilemma in the first sentence of the Tao Te King: \"The meaning that can be conceived is not the eternal meaning; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.\" Whoever is able to write such a sentence knows about the relativity and the subjective origin of every meaning and every name. He knows that every attribution of meaning and every naming creates a very particular reality. But in order to arrive at this knowledge, he had to catch himself, so to speak, in the act of inventing a reality. In other words: He had to discover how he first created a world \"in his image\", remained unconscious of the act of his creation, and then experienced it as the world life \"out there\" independent of him - the world of the counter-states (objects) - out of whose so-being he then constructed himself back-referentially. The senselessness of the search thus proves to be meaningful in its necessity. The wrong way must be taken in order to prove to be a wrong way. Wittgenstein must have had similar meanings when he wrote:"

In other words: What would be the world experience of a human being who would be able to see his world as his own construction? This person would be, as Varela already stated (p. 309), above all tolerant. Who has grasped that his world is his own invention, must grant this to the worlds of his fellow men. He who knows that he is not right, but that his view of things fits only right and wrong, will find it difficult to ascribe malice or madness to his fellow men and to persist in the primitive thinking of the Manichean \"He who is not for me is against me\". The insight that we know nothing as long as we do not know that we know nothing definitively is the precondition of respect for the realities invented by other people. Only when these other realities themselves become intolerant would he claim – again in Karl Popper's meaning – the right not to tolerate intolerance."

And yet, by their very nature, one cannot deny their mystical character, since in them the subject-object split obviously closes - even if only for seconds. The problem is only their description. The so-called mystics either fall into silence - as Wittgenstein recommends - or they are forced to use the language of the great models of their respective epoch; religion, mythology, philosophy and the like. In the incomparable simplicity of his style, Lao-tzu expresses this dilemma in the first sentence of the Tao Te King: \"The meaning that can be conceived is not the eternal meaning; the name that can be named is not the eternal name.\" Whoever is able to write such a sentence knows about the relativity and the subjective origin of every meaning and every name. He knows that every attribution of meaning and every naming creates a very particular reality. But in order to arrive at this knowledge, he had to catch himself, so to speak, in the act of inventing a reality. In other words: He had to discover how he first created a world \"in his image\", remained unconscious of the act of his creation, and then experienced it as the world life \"out there\" independent of him - the world of the counter-states (objects) - out of whose so-being he then constructed himself back-referentially. The senselessness of the search thus proves to be meaningful in its necessity. The wrong way must be taken in order to prove to be a wrong way. Wittgenstein must have had similar meanings when he wrote:"
