One scholar concludes that “Luhmann did not regard his filing cabinet as a simple slip box, rather he interacted with it as if it were a true communication partner.” (Alberto Cevolini, ed., Forgetting Machines: Knowledge Management Evolution in Early Modern Europe, Library of the Written Word, volume 53 (Leiden ; Boston: Brill, 2016), 26.

One scholar confirms that it would be misleading to classify the Antinet as something which simply stores notes.

You begin to insert yourself in their shoes while they were writing down the thoughts on the card."

Yet after a certain point, as early as 1981, he discovered its true power—his Zettelkasten became a thinking tool and communication partner that emerged almost as if it were its own mind, a ghost in the box. More on this will be covered later. More pertinent right now, however, is the second reason Luhmann started his Antinet."

It not only enables linking, it enables the self-referential composition of the Zettelkasten which gives it a unique personality. Luhmann holds this as one of the most important aspects of the system. The unique personality stands as the raw material which will help the Zettelkasten morph into an unexpected structure allowing you to communicate with the second mind, the doppelgänger, the ghost (or spirit, or mind) in the box, as Luhmann referred to it. This is the entity Luhmann was suggesting would communicate when he titled his paper, “Communication with Noteboxes.” Numeric-alpha addresses make this possible."

However, I opt to drop extended, and prefer second in its place. Why? Because as Yeo points out, extended is a rather vague term. Is it truly extended thought since it’s really my own thought?

It not only enables linking, it enables the self-referential composition of the Zettelkasten which gives it a unique personality. Luhmann holds this as one of the most important aspects of the system. The unique personality stands as the raw material which will help the Zettelkasten morph into an unexpected structure allowing you to communicate with the second mind, the doppelgänger, the ghost (or spirit, or mind) in the box, as Luhmann referred to it. This is the entity Luhmann was suggesting would communicate when he titled his paper, “Communication with Noteboxes.” Numeric-alpha addresses make this possible."
