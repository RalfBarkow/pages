They'd prefer to even be lazier yet and not need to include libraries just to perform basic typed input and output.  They'd prefer some greater optimization for space and speed, especially in pipelined workflows where the output is serialized to string just to be parsed again by the next process.

I can now easily perform queries, e.g:  \"mytable WHERE Comp1 = Comp2\" or \"mytable WHERE Comp1 = Complex(1, 5)\" and so on.  If, however, I cannot define a new type to represent Complex, then I'm forced to define my table as \"VAR mytable REAL RELATION {Comp1Real RATIONAL, Comp1Imaginary RATIONAL, Comp2Real RATIONAL, Comp2Imaginary RATIONAL} KEY {Comp1Real, Comp1Imaginary}\".  Furthermore, my queries become more complex.  E.g., \"mytable WHERE Comp1Real=Comp2Real AND Comp1Imaginary=Comp2Imaginary\", or \"mytable WHERE Comp1Real=1 AND Comp1Imaginary=5\".  And so on.  Which seems more kludgey to you?  A complex number is a very simple type; more complex types merely expand the difficulty shown above, complicate the implementation of the queries, obfuscate the intent of the queries, and potentially duplicate functionality throughout the system that could otherwise be represented [[Once And Only Once]] in a type definition.  Can you imagine what these examples would look like if the type was a tree, or other complicated structure?  Using a type, they wouldn't change significantly -- only the value selector would be different.  Maybe replace \"Complex(1, 2)\" with \"Tree(Node(1, Node(Node(2, 4), 3)))\", but the rest of the code would be essentially unchanged.

Research work is actively exploring this idea; it is only a matter of time before it becomes mainstream.  Interestingly, in many ways, this harks back to [[Ex Base]] systems like dBaseIII and [[Microsoft Access]], which (relatively) smoothly integrated database and application functionality for small \"desktop\" or workgroup database applications, but were lacking in the levels of scalability, portability, distributability, reliability, support for complex user-defined types, expected \"modern\" language features, and maintainability that are needed for enterprise-scale systems.

The simplest things required verbose API's if one wanted to do anything more than run a macro, especially at the column level. But as far as user-defined-types in DB's, what about sharing? If your little app creates a type called \"coordinate\", what then if a Java app, Python app, and a [[Crystal Reports]] project a department away also want that info? Do they need to re-define the coordinate type within? Successful apps almost always need to start sharing info at some stage in their maturity.

I.e., physical locality should only need to be considered for deployment; it shouldn't be an issue for development.  In the long term, I predict that successors to Java, Python, [[Crystal Reports]] et al. will support canonical user-defined type systems, which will permit sharability the same way that canonical built-in types -- e.g., integer, string, float, etc. -- are handled by mechanisms to support sharing despite the fact that they may have different representations in various languages.  Currently, mapping the differing representations of canonical built-in types is a function of ODBC/JDBC drivers and the like.

Shared types would need a similar \"killer need\". To embed something like that in each app language/tool is rather excessive. A kind of [[Abstraction Inversion]]. An underlying principle that affects this all is that <b>attributes are simply and inherently easier to share than types/objects</b>. We'll see flying cars before we ever see shared types.

You certainly can't argue it 'easier than attributes' or 'an order of magnitude in complexity'. I'll further note that it doesn't take a [[Turing Complete]] language to support very powerful \"type\" definitions that would serve most purposes - see [[Charity Language]] and [[Total Functional Programming]] for examples.
