If one wants to communicate on the level of the concept of rationality, one must therefore fade out any evaluation of interests, which of course does not exclude that interests can be recognized, acknowledged and evaluated differently. That organizations should decide rationally is thus the formula in which anyone (and now: the organization itself included) can clothe his expectation without identifying with any interests. It is, if you will, a decision-related equivalent of what in epistemology would be called \"objectivity\". But what can be meant by \"rationality\"?"
