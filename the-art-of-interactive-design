What's important is that language is a very popular topic in CS, so much so that we can consider it hardcore CS.

One wonders whether there are other words that would be useful. Especially since <i>those</i> can be reduced to 'from <i>this</i> to <i>this</i>' and so isn't a meaningfully distinct word. As it turns out, you can augment the mice's vocabulary by splitting <i>this</i> into <i>(look) this way</i> and <i>(touch) this thing</i>. I invented this mouse quasimode on the basis that it was associated with the Hand, now it looks like I have a theoretical justification for it.

Now compare this with my own analysis of the mouse vs keyboard as continuous vs discrete. That's from math. Apparently, math is far enough out from mainstream CS, and Crawford's area of interest, that he doesn't reach for it intuitively.",

In natural language, there are many words (eg, pronouns) used to point to things. So in <i>this</i> very sentence, which follows the <i>previous</i> sentence, I am saying <i>that</i>. In contrast, the keyboard is used to describe things. This is a very insightful observation and I'm still trying to figure out its implications. ",

            "text": "\nOne of the differences between pointing using language and pointing using a mouse is that the former has a much larger vocabulary for pointing. Mice, and other members of the rodent family, typically have only two words for pointing; <i>this</i> (select) and <i>those</i> (drag-select). One wonders whether there are other words that would be useful. Especially since <i>those</i> can be reduced to 'from <i>this</i> to <i>this</i>' and so isn't a meaningfully distinct word. As it turns out, you can augment the mice's vocabulary by splitting <i>this</i> into <i>(look) this way</i> and <i>(touch) this thing</i>. I invented this mouse quasimode on the basis that it was associated with the Hand, now it looks like I have a theoretical justification for it. Ironically, what I really wanted as a mouse quasimode (help inquiry showing possible actions on an object) can't be justified this way.",
