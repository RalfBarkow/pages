And as a matter of fact, the 1940s’ and 50s’ paradigm was the thermostat, as a model of controllable feedback. Balance and system maintenance were seen as the research-guiding backdrop for the correction of external disruptions, the development of control systems and the construction of intelligent machines. These efforts, all of them predominating the 1950s, were committed to the paradigm of [[Balance]], and are therefore neither suited for the analysis of non-linear processes, nor for coping with social complexity."
