      "text": "Fan goes on to describe in detail “China’s Selfie Obsession”—as her article is titled. Not only are people constantly taking and posting photos of themselves, and watching and commenting on other people’s photos, they are also spending a lot of time staging and editing these pictures. Fan—who is herself, as the British would say, “of Chinese extraction”—reports: “I asked a number of Chinese friends how long it takes them to edit a photo before posting it on social media. The answer for most of them was about forty minutes per face; a selfie taken with a friend would take well over an hour. The work requires several apps, each of which has particular strengths. No one I asked would consider posting or sending a photo that hadn’t been improved.” The article goes on to accurately relate the preoccupation with taking and presenting selfies in East Asia to a flourishing cosmetic surgery industry and a widespread and intense celebrity culture. Cosmetic surgery appears as a “medicinal app” that prepares the body for being photographed—it is a kind of biological photo edit prior to taking the actual photo. Celebrity worship, on the other hand, sets up a horizon of style. It provides everyone with a variety of profile models that provide orientation for self-shaping and self-presentation."

      "text": "As the term “obsession” in the title indicates, the New Yorker article clearly regards the preoccupation with the presentation of self-images as pathological. The Chinese, it seems, are crazy. And they are not only borderline out of their minds but also morally wanting. Fan launches two ethical criticisms against them. First, she depicts the intense interest in selfies as a form of narcissism, as a vain overindulgence with one’s own image and an unbecoming fascination with one’s beauty. Second, she regards “China’s selfie obsession” as an indication of a lack of individuality and [[Authenticity]]. She illustrates her criticism by relating a story about a corporate event at Meitu that she attended."

Her disapproval of the bonfire of vanities she witnessed there is symbolically expressed in recounting the following scene. An older woman, the wife of a janitor as it turned out, was ushered out by security guards, obviously regarded as an unfit intruder. Fan poetically describes her: “I caught sight of an older woman, perhaps in her seventies, standing and watching the young dancers with an expression of rapt, unfiltered joy. Her face was creased and leathery, but her mouth, agape with wonder, gave her a childlike look. She was the only person there who wasn’t holding a cellphone, and she was dressed plainly.” The woman’s exclusion from the party brings about an epiphany: “As the guards succeeded in ejecting her, I realized that she was the most beautiful person at the party.”"

Therefore she is, for Fan, in sharp contradistinction to the fakeness of the other party guests, the only genuine beauty."

      "text": "In her final verdict, Fan continues her plea for authenticity by accusing Meitu’s photo-editing apps and their Chinese users of undermining individuality and individual diversity: “Meitu and the trends it epitomizes seem to be moving China in the direction of homogeneity. A generation of Chinese, while clamorously asserting forms of individualism that would have been unthinkable for their parents and grandparents, is also enacting a ghastly convergence. Their selfies are becoming more and more similar, and so are their faces.” Readers of the New Yorker are left with the conclusion that, through the proliferation of social media and photo-editing apps, the Chinese have become all but completely unmoored. They are indecently vain and inauthentic. By implication, then, “we” Americans or Westerners are warned, lest we be infected by the same image craze taking hold of China. We must not lose our morally grounded sense of true beauty, which lies in “unfiltered” natural purity. We must not rob ourselves of individuality and become, as the Chinese are quickly spiraling toward, a homogenous mass devoid of uniqueness and diversity."

The same phenomena are equally common in, for instance, South Korea, Japan, and Singapore. But they did not originate in these places. Long before photo-editing apps, both cosmetic surgery and a celebrity industry were already prevalent in North America. Teeth whitening and face-lifts, for instance, were practices almost expected of aging people in the United States long before many in China had ever heard of such procedures. Capitalism, too, along with the commodification of beauty, predates both the recent economic surge of China and the advent of social media."

      "text": "The core problem of Fan’s article—shared by many current critiques of social media—is, however, that it is unable to understand the “selfie obsession” in terms of profilicity.4 It wrongly depicts it as a primarily cultural (“Chinese”) issue and not a social and psychological phenomenon of identity construction that has global dimensions. As an immediate consequence of this cultural categorization, the article demonstrates an equally problematic bias toward the value of “authenticity” and assumes that truly authentic individuals and genuine beauty exist, both of which are now polluted by social media. Along with this assumption, highly questionable idealizations of authenticity are presented, and staunch good-bad dichotomies emerge (such as natural vs. artificial)."

      "text": "To be sure, obsessive selfie taking and selfie editing happen. And, yes: selfie taking and editing are hardly “authentic.” But does it make sense to decry selfie taking as inauthentic if it was never intended to be authentic in the first place? Why measure it against authenticity? It seems that the actual function of Fan’s article is to defend the ideal of authenticity at a moment when it is most threatened. Fan’s essay attempts to conceal the imminent breakdown of this false ideal. It seeks to save authenticity at a time when it is losing its foothold in society due to its own inconsistencies and anachronisms. The vehement defense of authenticity in the face of an increasingly omnipresent profilicity has the purpose of assuring ourselves that we can still be authentic at a time when in fact we too have already become wildly profilic."

      "text": "Fan’s condemnation of the Chinese selfie-obsession and the resulting uniformity of self-images in China also comes with her Twitter handle and a picture: a profile picture of author Jiayang Fan herself. This picture is not an edited photo. It is a digitally altered portrait based on a photo or drawing. All essays in the New Yorker are accompanied by such images of their authors in the exact same format. To use Jiayang Fan’s terms: these pictures show a “homogeneity” and a “ghastly convergence.” The author images evoke the standardized connotation of “cool,” creative, original, young, intellectual people as represented in animated clips or movies. The alterations to her photo align Jiayang Fan’s profile with the profiles of all the other contributors to the magazine, and thereby with the profile of the New Yorker as a media company. Here, the same profilic mechanism so disparagingly described by Fan at the Meitu party is at work—arguably working overtime. Both Meitu and the New Yorker align the profiles of their representatives with one another so that, taken together, they support the profile of the companies. This operates in the other direction too, of course. By being aligned with the New Yorker profile, Jiayang Fan’s own profile and those of her coworkers are raised, just as working for or with Meitu can be a profilicity boost for those who do so."

Her entire presence at the event resembled a smartphone; picturing and heavily editing it and its participants (for more than an hour, we assume) for her own media audience—readers of the New Yorker. In her report Fan metaphorically alters the appearance of the older woman precisely so that this “unfiltered” woman comes to represent the authentic life that Fan wants to show her readers (and her editor). The image of the “unedited” elderly woman presented in Fan’s essay is in fact just as manipulated as the hundreds, if not thousands, of pictures posted by the Meitu party guests on their own social media accounts."

Like most readers of this book, and of course its authors, she has several: in addition to Twitter, she is also active on Facebook and LinkedIn. On these public platforms, a good number of Fan’s photos are shown. Most of them are beautiful. It is difficult to tell if they are edited or how much time may have been spent choosing the one that was “just right,” but none of them seems to correspond well to the ideal of unfiltered authentic beauty that Fan’s epiphany at the Meitu party revealed."

This “edited” authenticity is put into the service of furthering the profilicity of the critics or the media companies they represent. In this way, the critics reproduce and proliferate the very same profilic conditions that they critique. They operate under conditions of profilicity but, paradoxically, still display an ideal of authenticity that they performatively contradict in this very display."

Of course almost everybody knows that almost everybody uses photo-editing apps. It is, like using makeup, by no means a secretive act of hidden manipulation. It is plainly there for everyone to see. Everyone does it, and everyone knows it and is expected to do it. As Fan mentioned: “No one I asked would consider posting or sending a photo that hadn’t been improved.” In China—or, to put it more accurately, in the global world of social media today—many users do not aim at presenting authenticity in the first place. The tourist taking selfies at Bamboo Bay does not pretend authenticity. And if authenticity appears, then it is often clearly staged, like someone posting on Facebook a photo of an “authentic” local dish. Here, authenticity is put in the service of profilicity."

Ironically, since these criticisms themselves are produced under conditions of profilicity, they do not (and cannot) meet their own authenticity ideal. Their authenticity can be deconstructed and revealed to be staged and inauthentic. The very calls to preserve our supposed authenticity only show that the age of authenticity has lost its credibility."

ISBN 978-0-231-19601-7. Available from: https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/moel19600More and more, we present ourselves and encounter others through profiles. A profile shows us not as we are seen directly but how we are perceived by a broader public. As we observe how others observe us, we calibrate our self-presentation accordingly. Profile-based identity is evident everywhere from pop culture to politics,\nmarketing to morality. But all too often critics simply denounce\nthis alleged superficiality in defense of some supposedly pure\nideal of authentic or sincere expression. This book argues that the profile marks an epochal shift in our concept of identity and\ndemonstrates why that matters.  You and Your Profile  blends social theory, philosophy, and cultural critique to unfold an\nexploration of the way we have come to experience the world.\nInstead of polemicizing against the profile, Hans-Georg Moeller and Paul J. D’Ambrosio outline how it works, how we readily apply it in our daily lives, and how it shapes our values-personally,\neconomically, and ethically. They develop a practical vocabulary of life in the digital age. Informed by the Daoist tradition, they\nsuggest strategies for handling the pressure of social media by\ndistancing oneself from one’s public face. A deft and wide-ranging consideration of our era’s identity crisis, this book provides\nvital clues on how to stay sane in a time of proliferating\nprofiles.\n"

No one I asked would consider posting or sending a photo that hadn’t been improved.” The article goes on to accurately relate the preoccupation with taking and presenting selfies in East Asia to a flourishing cosmetic surgery industry and a widespread and intense celebrity culture. Cosmetic surgery appears as a “medicinal app” that prepares the body for being photographed—it is a kind of biological photo edit prior to taking the actual photo. Celebrity worship, on the other hand, sets up a horizon of style. It provides everyone with a variety of profile models that provide orientation for self-shaping and self-presentation."

Her disapproval of the bonfire of vanities she witnessed there is symbolically expressed in recounting the following scene. An older woman, the wife of a janitor as it turned out, was ushered out by security guards, obviously regarded as an unfit intruder. Fan poetically describes her: “I caught sight of an older woman, perhaps in her seventies, standing and watching the young dancers with an expression of rapt, unfiltered joy. Her face was creased and leathery, but her mouth, agape with wonder, gave her a childlike look. She was the only person there who wasn’t holding a cellphone, and she was dressed plainly.” The woman’s exclusion from the party brings about an epiphany: “As the guards succeeded in ejecting her, I realized that she was the most beautiful person at the party.”"

They are indecently vain and inauthentic. By implication, then, “we” Americans or Westerners are warned, lest we be infected by the same image craze taking hold of China. We must not lose our morally grounded sense of true beauty, which lies in “unfiltered” natural purity. We must not rob ourselves of individuality and become, as the Chinese are quickly spiraling toward, a homogenous mass devoid of uniqueness and diversity."

The same phenomena are equally common in, for instance, South Korea, Japan, and Singapore. But they did not originate in these places. Long before photo-editing apps, both cosmetic surgery and a celebrity industry were already prevalent in North America. Teeth whitening and face-lifts, for instance, were practices almost expected of aging people in the United States long before many in China had ever heard of such procedures. Capitalism, too, along with the commodification of beauty, predates both the recent economic surge of China and the advent of social media."

Fan’s essay attempts to conceal the imminent breakdown of this false ideal. It seeks to save authenticity at a time when it is losing its foothold in society due to its own inconsistencies and anachronisms. The vehement defense of authenticity in the face of an increasingly omnipresent profilicity has the purpose of assuring ourselves that we can still be authentic at a time when in fact we too have already become wildly profilic."

This picture is not an edited photo. It is a digitally altered portrait based on a photo or drawing. All essays in the New Yorker are accompanied by such images of their authors in the exact same format. To use Jiayang Fan’s terms: these pictures show a “homogeneity” and a “ghastly convergence.” The author images evoke the standardized connotation of “cool,” creative, original, young, intellectual people as represented in animated clips or movies. The alterations to her photo align Jiayang Fan’s profile with the profiles of all the other contributors to the magazine, and thereby with the profile of the New Yorker as a media company. Here, the same profilic mechanism so disparagingly described by Fan at the Meitu party is at work—arguably working overtime. Both Meitu and the New Yorker align the profiles of their representatives with one another so that, taken together, they support the profile of the companies. This operates in the other direction too, of course. By being aligned with the New Yorker profile, Jiayang Fan’s own profile and those of her coworkers are raised, just as working for or with Meitu can be a profilicity boost for those who do so."

        "text": "In comparison with their critic, the obsessed Chinese selfiers are rather straightforward with regard to their “fake” images. Of course almost everybody knows that almost everybody uses photo-editing apps. It is, like using makeup, by no means a secretive act of hidden manipulation. It is plainly there for everyone to see. Everyone does it, and everyone knows it and is expected to do it. As Fan mentioned: “No one I asked would consider posting or sending a photo that hadn’t been improved.” In China—or, to put it more accurately, in the global world of social media today—many users do not aim at presenting authenticity in the first place. The tourist taking selfies at Bamboo Bay does not pretend authenticity. And if authenticity appears, then it is often clearly staged, like someone posting on Facebook a photo of an “authentic” local dish. Here, authenticity is put in the service of profilicity."

        "text": "Criticisms of social media tend to disregard its non- or transauthentic orientation and inappropriately set up a “pure” authenticity standard as the only correct option. Ironically, since these criticisms themselves are produced under conditions of profilicity, they do not (and cannot) meet their own authenticity ideal. Their authenticity can be deconstructed and revealed to be staged and inauthentic. The very calls to preserve our supposed authenticity only show that the age of authenticity has lost its credibility."
