They are a shorthand of our values and expectations and have the power to spark instant reflection: ‘We all swim together’, ‘Anchored in Excellence’, ‘The standard you walk past is the standard you accept, ‘Who are you championing?’, ‘[[Fit In and Stand Out]]’, ‘Learning is the work’. Mantras allow us to synthesise and succinctly express elements of culture.\n"

The shipping anchor that graces the entry to our school grounds symbolises the Griffin State School motto: ‘Anchored in Excellence’. Gifts are decorated with ribbons in our school colours, threaded through charms in the shape of shipping anchors. A sculpture of an osprey – our school mascot – flies high in a building foyer. ‘Super Teacher’ cartoon images adorn classroom walls. Miniature plastic slinkies are used in staff collaboration to exemplify what is ‘[[Tight and Loose]]’. Our Learner Tools anchor us to the book Educating Ruby and support us to grow the 21st century skills of our learners. In the same way that we invite curiosity in the classroom, school events are set up to include ‘provocations’ – displays designed to spark interest and intrigue. At Griffin State School, artefacts are totems that convey crucial elements of our culture as visual cues. \n"

Our staff induction program, our Super Teachers ‘Cape Up’ on the last day of each term, our ‘Guard of Honour’ on the final day of the school year, and the red carpet that our learners walk each time they enter our assembly hall, in recognition of their importance. Rituals and traditions keep the story alive. "
