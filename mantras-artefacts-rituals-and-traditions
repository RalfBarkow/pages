Interestingly, we've named and cherished them from the start, aware of their profound power in culture cultivation. We recognised that they connected us, both to each other and to our purpose, our whys. Being a new school with no history, we clung to them as symbols of who we were, our vision. We swiftly recognised how they powerfully propelled the development of our community, transforming it into a culture. We hold onto mantras, artefacts, rituals, and traditions dearly. We're proud of them. For us, they illuminate 'The Griffin Way'. "
