(Vendor independence was another reason for the interest.) Many in the field seemed to think it was a bad idea, partly because it would allegedly attract poorly-skilled riff-raff into the field, but largely for machine resource/performance reasons. However, the hardware improvements eventually made it practical. It was an early consideration of [[Computer Programming For Everybody]]. Somewhat related: [[Mind Overhaul Economics]]. The \"riff-raff\" argument perhaps can be compared to the \"overly-smart IDE\" debates we have today.",
