      "text": "In 1935, Stephen C. Pepper published an article precisely defining what he meant by \"The Root of Metaphor Theory of Metaphysics\" in the _Journal of Philosophy_.\n\n> The root metaphor theory of metaphysics is a theory of the origin and development of metaphysical hypotheses. If correct, it entails certain consequences clarifying not only to the field of metaphysics but to other cognitive fields as well. It involves \n\n> * first (1), the proposition that dogmatism is illegitimate and unnecessary in cognitive procedure; \n\n> * second (2), that the method of hypothesis is legitimate, and so far as we can see, the only available undogmatic method; and, \n\n> * third (3), that one way, and perhaps the only way, in which metaphysical hypotheses can be derived is through the analysis of a selected group of facts (which I call the root metaphor) and the expansion of that analysis among other facts. \n\n> The third proposition presupposes the first two, and the second the first; but the first proposition does not involve the other two, nor the second the third. \n\n> One may eschew dogmatism and not champion a method of hypothesis, provided one can think of any other undogmatic cognitive method, but one may accept the method of hypothesis and not champion the root metaphor method, provided one can think of any other better hypothetical method by which metaphysical hypotheses may be derived. \n\n> I will take the first two propositions up very briefly, for a thorough discussion of them would lead far beyond the bounds of a single paper, and I will spend my time mainly on the third. This paper, then, is an argument in the form: If the first two propositions are true, let me show you that the third proposition also is true-namely, that one way and perhaps the only way of legitimately developing a metaphysical hypothesis is by the root metaphor method.

Any coherent world hypothesis is based on a central, guiding analogy called a root metaphor.\n\n> 3. Just as it is impermissible to mix metaphors in the literary sense, it is likewise wrong to mix root metaphors, since the result is confusion.\n\n> 4. The impermissibility of mixing root metaphors implies that all the interpretations made by world hypotheses, including their theories of truth, likewise cannot be mixed.\n\n> 5. Since none of the major world hypotheses is significantly better than any of the other major ones, we are obliged to accept the good points of each while at the same time not amalgamating them into an indiscriminate eclecticism.  [p. 5]\n\n> Pepper ascribes the correspondence theory of truth to a world hypothesis he calls \"formism,\" the coherence theory to \"organicism,\" the pragmatic (or operational) theory to \"contextualism,\" and the causal-adjustment theory to \"mechanism.\" [pp. 5-6]\n\n> [....]\n\n> The aim of the present dissertation is to solve the problem posed in the passage just cited, i.e., to reveal the \"cognitive significance\" hidden in the interrelationships of the major world hypotheses and their theories of truth.
