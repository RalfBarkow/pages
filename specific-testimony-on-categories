Indexes on the other hand are simply lists of characteristics or topics, usually but not always prepared manually or systematically, usually alphabetically organized, and in the case of wikis, serving as hyperlinks to what is listed. As such the index serves as a pre-organized, use as is listing. I use lists, whether indexes or otherwise as basis for collections of pages to be contained in another collection of Pdf files placed in a reachable location which can then be searched as single documents, or as a collection of documents for more wanted information at a later date. In the case of wikis, I use a method I call [[Wiki Batics]] to construct my Information Base. [[It Depends]] to a large degree on the scale and depth to which one will go to get what is wanted. I prefer to build my information in such a way as to make it, not only immediately useful, but also useful at a later date in ways not yet anticipated.</i> -- [[Donald Noyes]] ",

I remembered reading specific discussions on engineering process and process related matters such as requirements gathering and zero defect process, but I could not recall the specific pages, the authors, nor the words used to express some of these ideas. By searching through the categories I came across pretty much everything I needed to extract in order to bring my points into focus. Without the categories I would have spent a great deal of time hunting for stuff I needed but didn't know how to find. -- [[Marty Schrader]]",
