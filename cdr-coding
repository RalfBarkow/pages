        "text": "Ward via matrix DM: Dan wrote the prototype Smalltalk interpreter on both sides of one page of paper, thus meeting Alan's challenge. (I might have been getting an abbreviated story as I heard it second hand.)\nThe draft of the Smalltalk-80 Blue Book had a chapter where they implemented Lisp in Smalltalk. This really connected for me because I had just finished reading Sussman & Steel's [[The Art of the Interpreter]]. All of the other reviewers said to ditch that chapter so they did. Thus the last connection with lisp was severed.\nI also knew enough about lisp implementations that [[CDR-Coding]] was the hack that made S-Expressions memory efficient. Smalltalk objects were already allocated in contiguous blocks of memory so CDR-Coding was unnecessary.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDR_coding"
