But the question is what in nomad life is a principle and what is only a consequence.\n\n> To begin with, although the points determine paths, they are strictly subordinated to the paths they determine, the reverse happens with the sedentary. The water point is reached only in order to be left behind; every point is a relay and exists only as a relay. A path is always between two points, but the in-between has taken on all the consistency and enjoys both an autonomy and a direction of its own.\n\n> [[Deleuze and Guattari]]. The life of the nomad is the intermezzo. (380)",
