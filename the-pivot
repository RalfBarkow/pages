What we were curious about was that it seemed not necessarily the technology itself where answers could be found, but how the technology companies were bringing about that change. We were curious to investigate further agile, collaboration, inquiry and design thinking. We had planned to have Thompson Morrison and Jami Fluke meet the group in San Francisco to explore these things further."

A small group, described as a 'learning pod', drawn mostly from from members of the 2019 study tour group were invited to undertake the first 'DIG' conducted in Australia. This was a learning sprint to unleash the creative potential in learners. What stands out from that experience is very hard, if not impossible, to describe. The learning journey we experienced 'can't be unseen, can't be unfelt'."

I had also encouraged a colleague who had joined me on the first study tour, Vicki Baker, to British Columbia to also undertake a DIG and she did so with her leadership team. These two school leaders were curious and [[Sensed Opportunity]], not for self promotion, but to make a difference for their teachers and students. These schools became [[Lighthouse Schools]] in Australia. Expansion seemed slow to me because what was being offered was difficult to market. Words were not sufficient in describing it. However, the movement to bring learning alive in schools across the state had been established and the [[Collective Learning]] has confirmed we can indeed reimagine schooling."

I had also encouraged a colleague who had joined me on the first study tour, Vicki Baker, to British Columbia to also undertake a DIG and she did so with her leadership team. These two school leaders were curious and [[Sensed Opportunity]], not for self promotion, but to make a difference for their teachers and students. These schools become [[Lighthouse Schools]] in Australia. Expansion seemed slow to me because what was being offered was difficult to market. Words were not sufficient in describing it. However, the movement to bring learning alive in schools across the state had been established and the [[Collective Learning]] has confirmed we can indeed reimagine schooling."

A small group, described as a 'learning pod', drawn from members of the 2019 study tour group were invited to undertake the first 'DIG' conducted in Australia. This was a learning sprint to unleash the creative potential in learners. What stands out from that experience is very hard, if not impossible, to describe. It is acknowledged that the learning journey we experienced 'can't be unseen, can't be unfelt'."

        "text": "Following the success for the 2019 QASSP Study Tour, and the wonderings about what was experienced in Dayton, the 2020 Study Tour was to investigate how schooling systems were responding to a changing world. What we were curious about was that it seemed not necessarily the technology itself where answers could be found, but how the technology companies were bringing about that change. We were curious to investigate further agile, collaboration, inquiry and design thinking. We had planned to have Thompson Morrison and Jami Fluke meet the group in San Francisco to explore these things further."
