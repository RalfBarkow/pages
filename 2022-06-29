These additions are suitable for the purposes of knowledge representation of engineering design. A dynamic, knowledge representation scheme is supported that allows temporary associations between objects residing in separate, static, hierarchical structures. Message passing between these associated objects is dynamic. Messages are passed, incompletely satisfied, between socially acquainted objects in order to complete a computation. We show that a computing paradigm previously achieved by a specific language, written in the Actor tradition, can also be achieved in a strictly class-instance based language which is then used to create a design knowledge representation environment. A simple, accessible example is used to illustrate the power and generality of the new language.\n"

Today, writing is combined with substitutability, with an ease of text manipulation that would have been almost unimaginable two decades ago. This is true to a great extent from the writing side, but more and more also related to the reading side. With regard to your question, I recommend simply imagining that children would hardly ever be confronted with pencil and eraser, fountain pen and paper, but would instead start directly with computers and word processing programs, and then examine what then actually drops out or where gains can be recorded."

        "text": "I start with sense. We designate with this word a universal, not negatable, highly mobile medium. As always, we do not assume that this sense exists, but that it is generated in every actuality and that this generation depends on the form of differan- ce. Sense, whatever it refers to, whatever horizons it is set in, stages itself through supplementary operations which, if I may put it quaintly, an-sense respective sense post festum. We have discussed this. And we have also said that a certain despair can be connected with it, namely that sense cannot be fixed.\nIn the first step, we then claim that the WWW as a social system (in this perspective) naturally processes meaning, and, as you can easily convince yourself, in any fullness, concreteness, simplicity or complexity. Everything that is communicable can also be found in this net, from pornography to diploma theses, from often richly bizarre homepages to the possibility of playing games online, cybersex, poetry, politics, but of course also economics, law and religion - simply everything. One would almost have to say that this everything (except for control measures that are starting here and there, but which can hardly be kept up ubiquitously) is exactly what we already had in our discussion of the system of society: an everything as a totum, as a world, as a compendium of meaning that can be put into the WWW at will.\nHere, too, the suspicion arises that the world in the worldwide web (WWW) does not have the sense of a globality at all, of an extended space, because already empirically it is clear that by far not all people of mankind (and I would rather say: of mankind) are reached by the blessings of this web. The totum of the world arises in the net as arbitrariness of the implementation of specific sense. This means nothing more than that everyone can put any documents on the net, articles, porn, music, movies, sales offers, homepages, stock exchange prices, train schedules, bomb making instructions etc.pp. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)"
