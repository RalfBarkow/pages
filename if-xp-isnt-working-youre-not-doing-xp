It might even be the case that XP can accommodate BigDesignUpFront (in cases where there's obviously no other way), formal proofs instead of UnitTest''''''s and everything else ever invented. After all things like \"listen to what the code says\" (design) and \"listen to what the customer says\" (analysis) can mean anything at all and consequently are as useful as \"breathing is good for you\". See ReplaceDocumentation for a particularly funny illustration of the \"only if it works for you\" approach.\n  1.XP is an effective method for a limited set of problem domains. However Xpers don't have neither the time nor the inclination to try to come up themselves with a list of specific contexts where XP applies effectively and where it doesn't. Their general attitude is that XP should work everywhere, until proven contrary if ever possible, and of course they won't live up to the responsibility and the critical thinking it takes to explore and define the limitations of their own creation. They wait for others to do it, and would rather sit back and see what happens. After all, doesn't everybody else do the same? In the meantime they make sure to create more hype than arguments and lure more and more people to their religion. But isn't again what everybody else is doing?",

Being in front already, there is no more risk just reinvestment of previous gains in more. I then further suggest that Fred not be stupid and that if some tests made it good more might make it better. I further suggest, that it is possible to write too many and that Fred should keep adding more until the cost/benefit fades out to near 1. I then suggest that with Freds tests in place, Fred might find that some of Freds tested code is cumbersome hard to use and change. Try fixing it, really fixing it. Being a hard task try using two heads and brainstorming some ideas. See if the tests Fred put in earlier save Fred from danger and produce success. I then suggest Fred think about changing but do not attempt, changing some untested code. Is Fred scared? In that case I think I found a reason for Fred to go back and write more tests.

In particular XP rules are enounced with such a generality and lack of precision that XP can really take no counter examples. It might even be the case that XP can accommodate BigDesignUpFront (in cases where there's obviously no other way), formal proofs instead of UnitTest''''''s and everything else ever invented. After all things like \"listen to what the code says\" (design) and \"listen to what the customer says\" (analysis) can mean anything at all and consequently are as useful as \"breathing is good for you\". See ReplaceDocumentation for a particularly funny illustration of the \"only if it works for you\" approach.\n  1.XP is an effective method for a limited set of problem domains. However Xpers don't have neither the time nor the inclination to try to come up themselves with a list of specific contexts where XP applies effectively and where it doesn't. Their general attitude is that XP should work everywhere, until proven contrary if ever possible, and of course they won't live up to the responsibility and the critical thinking it takes to explore and define the limitations of their own creation. They wait for others to do it, and would rather sit back and see what happens. After all, doesn't everybody else do the same?

Being a hard task try using two heads and brainstorming some ideas. See if the tests Fred put in earlier save Fred from danger and produce success.
