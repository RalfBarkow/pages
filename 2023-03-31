      "text": "Big Tech is on the precipice of ‘counterfeiting’ human beings – creating AI that passes itself off convincingly as a human being in online contexts. Even experts are susceptible to being convinced. Although there is widespread agreement between philosophers and AI experts that AI chatbots are not sentient, their existence and use raises pressing ethical questions. Should we outlaw AI designed to pass itself as human, for much the same reason that we outlaw counterfeit money?"

Charles Baudelaire's short story \"La fausse monnaie,\" which is included in the volume as a bilingual fold-out, provides the perspective point: a friend of the first-person narrator gives a beggar far too much, namely a silver two-franc piece. When the narrator makes a comment about this, the friend first replies that it was a false coin, but then explains faithfully that it is a pleasure to give a person pleasure by giving him more than he expects. The narrator would still have forgiven him the false gift, also, for example, the amoral pleasure of compromising a poor person or perhaps even providing him with an interesting experience in this way, but not the self-confident stupidity of the second sentence, according to which he very economically wants to stand before himself – and Baudelaire does not forget to mention this – before God as a benefactor."

      "text": "Derrida argues at length about whether one can trust a friend who gives counterfeit money to a beggar. He adopts the perspective of the questionable first-person narrator to such an extent that he doubts the friendship of the friend who gives counterfeit money, but not that of the person who judges his \"friend\" in this way. The counterfeiter can even be trusted more, because he admits it openly – the other one cherishes his suspicion only in the intriguing mind games of his, as Baudelaire suggests utmost distance, \"miserable brain looking for noon at two o'clock\". Baudelaire plays at staking a moral two-franc play against \"God's heart\" and paradise, thus hyperbolically riding to death the linguistic forms and thought processes of a long-devalued moralism. Curiously, Derrida has not developed a sense of this irony, which is nevertheless so abundantly clear from the form of the narrative. Apparently, the question is whether perfidy is less bad than stupidity – in reality, however, all the perfidy and stupidity present in the story is in the \"misérable cerveau\" of the narrator himself."

The counterfeiter can even be trusted more, because he admits it openly - the other one cherishes his suspicion only in the intriguing mind games of his, as Baudelaire suggests utmost distance, \"miserable brain looking for noon at two o'clock\".
