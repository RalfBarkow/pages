However, although the language itself is simple, it is becoming common knowledge that becoming truly proficient with the Smalltalk environment is no simple achievement. Although we are still far short of being able to inject all the wisdom of a seasoned Smalltalk guru into a guru-wanna-be in a few short weeks, the industry has become more efficient in spreading the knowledge, while its education processes have matured. The effectiveness of the training available today for objects and Smalltalk exceeds that of many of the other technologies with which we are becoming inundated. This is especially true when one realizes the significant difference between Smalltalk and other technologies and the relatively wide gulf between the known and the unknown."
