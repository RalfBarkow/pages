Try resizing your browser when on [[All The Web]] (narrow browser) - the results are easier to read, like Google. Still, harder to read than google and you cannot just resize your browser every time you go to all the Web, since other Web pages you visit will not need you to have the resized browser (leading you to constantly fiddling with your browser window size).",

I think I'm more interested in the fascination of what could be done to make all Web pages more readable, faster, universally, than I am complaining about wiki. It is interesting to note and acknowledge that fellow [[Wiki People]] do agree with me about narrow text being easier to scan and read over, as I know human beings can read faster when everything is in columns.

The students appeared to respond well to this, and the feedback was positive. The most significant problem, if any, was that although we encouraged the students to cross-reference (link to) each other's work, they tended not to; with a few exceptions, each student's work tended to be a [[Walled Garden]] unto itself.

The students were required to submit an essay assignment as a Wiki page or set of pages. This was quite successful, with no deliberate defacement. The students appeared to respond well to this, and the feedback was positive. The most significant problem, if any, was that although we encouraged the students to cross-reference (link to) each other's work, they tended not to; with a few exceptions, each student's work tended to be a [[Walled Garden]] unto itself. Of course, this is true here as well. I frequently find myself scrambling to remember enough of a [[Wiki Page]] I saw three weeks ago in order to search for it and create an appropriate link; often as not I can't find it and the concept or whatever remains unlinked. I'm sure there's a [[Wiki Word]] that describes this effect in detail, but I ran across it three weeks ago and now I can't find it.</i> -- [[Dave Voorhis]]",
