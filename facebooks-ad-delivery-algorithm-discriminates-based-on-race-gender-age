For example, &quot;When you choose to include a picture of a woman versus a man, in general it will go more to women, except images of young women, which go more to older men,&quot; explained Northeastern's Alan Mislove. Facebook's algorithm is trained on the data parent company Meta has collected from all ads run on the platform and the responses those ads received. Northeastern's Piotr Sapiezynski said the algorithm uses race, gender, and age to make &quot;very crude&quot; estimations about where to transmit ads."
