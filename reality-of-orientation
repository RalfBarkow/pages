If then perspective tries to focus itself, observation thus tries to observe itself, it cannot focus or observe something else in perspective at the same time.

Even with the formula of will or wills to power, Nietzsche does not propose a new ontology, but rather an anti-ontology, the paradoxical notion of a unity of mere differences, of a being that is not determined by anything, in which everything incessantly engages with everything and thereby continuously changes, even what is literally 'determined' in the [[Process]]. Wills to power are conceived as perspectives in their opposition, one \"as a temporary condition of existence\" of the other.

In FW (Aph. 374) he clarifies in his own way what he understands by perspectivism – without using the term again. He explicitly suspends the ontological questioning (\"whether [...] all Dasein is essentially an expository Dasein [or not] – that cannot, how cheaply, be worked out even by the most diligent and scrupulously conscientious analysis and self-examination of the intellect\", FW, KSA 3, 626 f.). Thus, also for his own philosophizing and also at this point, it remains as a starting point that \"the human intellect, in this analysis, cannot avoid seeing itself under its perspective forms and seeing itself only in them\"; it cannot know \"what other kinds of intellect and perspective there might be\" (ibid.)."

Nietzsche says \"corner\" („Ecke“): \"we are today at least far from the ridiculous immodesty to decree from our corner that one may only have perspectives from this corner\" (ibid.) In the impetus of uncertainties one can become aware that one operates in a limited perspective: One can keep reflecting on the uncertainties, but in doing so one does not arrive at certainties. Nietzsche puts it this way: \"The world has rather become 'infinite' to us once again: insofar as we cannot reject the possibility that it includes infinite interpretations\" (ibid., 627). >> infinite"

In JGB (Aph. 188) he called 'stupidity' directly \"the narrowing of perspective,\" \"the need for limited horizons,\" which is \"a condition of life and growth\" (JGB, KSA 5, 110), and in JGB (Aph. 231) he spoke simply of the \"great stupidity that we are\" (JGB, KSA 5, 170).

Nietzsche 'constructs' him from the perspective of his perspectivism as the god of his perspectivism – thereby precautionarily occupying the place that would otherwise be quickly reoccupied elsewhere. The proclamation of Dionysus as the god of philosophizing is supposed to arm one to reflect again on vital stupidity and folly where one cannot avoid surrendering to them (\"let us come to the aid of our 'God' with all our 'devils'!\", it says in JGB, KSA 5, 163) and thus to strengthen \"honesty\". But even against honesty one must remain suspicious. For \"what do we know of ourselves in the end? [...] Our honesty, we free spirits, – let us see to it that it does not become our vanity, our finery and pomp, our limit, our stupidity!

The 'standpoint' is not a 'standing' point and the horizon, […], 'the limiting', not a 'fixed' boundary. With the entry of [[Time]] into them they become paradoxical, but through the temporal metaphor of 'displacement' or 'movement' the paradox is at the same time obscured, made invisible, invisibilized. Thus, perspectives 'with time' become paradoxical to themselves on the one hand, observable on the other. A perspective, having shifted its standpoint and horizon in observing something else, can distinguish itself as earlier and later, thus also observing itself. It then becomes reflexive: the concept of reflexivity also starts from a metaphor of movement, that of 'bending back' (lat. reflectere). In another metaphor it appears as self-reference (from Latin referre, 'to carry back, to direct back, to refer to')."

Even with the formula of will or wills to power, Nietzsche does not propose a new ontology, but rather an anti-ontology, the paradoxical notion of a unity of mere differences, of a being that is not determined by anything, in which everything incessantly engages with everything and thereby continuously changes, even what is literally 'determined' in the [[Process]]. Wills to power are conceived as perspectives in their opposition, one \"as a temporary condition of existence\" of the other.
