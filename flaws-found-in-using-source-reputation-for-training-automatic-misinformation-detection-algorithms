      "text": "Rutgers University scientists found algorithms trained to detect `fake news' may have a flawed approach for assessing the credibility of online news stories.  The researchers said most of these programs do not evaluate an article's credibility, but instead rely on a credibility score for the article's sources. They rated the credibility and political leaning of 1,000 news articles and incorporated the assessment into misinformation-detection algorithms, then evaluated the labeling methodology's impact on the algorithms' performance. Article-level source labels matched just 51% of the time, illustrating the source reputation method 's lack of reliability. In response, the researchers created a new dataset of journalistic-quality, individually labeled articles and a process for misinformation detection and fairness audits."
