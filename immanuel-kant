      "text": "__Immanuel Kant__ (; 22 April 1724â€“ 12 February 1804) was a German [[Philosophy]] and one of the central [[Age of Enlightenment]] thinkers. Kant's comprehensive and systematic works in [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[ethics]], and [[aesthetics]] have made him one of the most influential figures in modern [[Western philosophy]] - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant wikipedia]"

      "text": "In his doctrine of [[transcendental idealism]], Kant argued that [[space]] and [[time]] are mere \"forms of intuition\" which structure all [[experience]], and therefore that while \"[[Thing-in-itself]]\" exist and contribute to experience, they are nonetheless distinct from the objects of experience. From this it follows that the objects of experience are mere \"appearances\", and that the nature of things as they are in themselves is consequently unknowable to us. In an attempt to counter the [[Philosophical skepticism]] he found in the writings of philosopher [[David Hume]], he wrote the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781/1787), one of his most well-known works. In it, he developed his theory of experience to answer the question of whether [[Analytic-synthetic distinction]] ''[[a priori]]'' knowledge is possible, which would in turn make it possible to determine the limits of [[metaphysical]] inquiry. Kant drew a parallel to the [[Copernican Revolution#Immanuel Kant]] in his proposal that the objects of the senses must conform to our spatial and temporal forms of [[intuition]], and that we can consequently have ''a priori'' cognition of the objects of the senses."

      "text": "Kant believed that [[reason]] is also the source of [[morality]], and that [[aesthetics]] arise from a faculty of disinterested judgment. Kant's views continue to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy, especially the fields of [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[political theory]], and [[Aesthetics#Post-modern aesthetics and psychoanalysis]]. He attempted to explain the relationship between reason and human experience and to move beyond what he believed to be the failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics. He wanted to put an end to what he saw as an era of futile and speculative theories of human experience, while resisting the skepticism of thinkers such as Hume. He regarded himself as showing the way past the impasse between [[rationalists]] and [[empiricists]], and is widely held to have synthesized both traditions in his thought."

      "text": "Kant was an exponent of the idea that [[perpetual peace]] could be secured through universal [[democracy]] and [[international cooperation]], and that perhaps this could be the culminating stage of [[world history]]. The nature of Kant's religious views continues to be the subject of scholarly dispute, with viewpoints ranging from the impression that he shifted from an early defense of an [[ontological argument]] for the existence of God to a principled [[agnosticism]], to more critical treatments epitomized by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who criticized the imperative form of Kantian ethics as \"theological morals\" and the \"Mosaic Decalogue in disguise\", and [[Nietzsche]], who claimed that Kant had \"theologian blood\" and was merely a sophisticated [[apologist]] for traditional [[Christianity]] faith. Beyond his religious views, Kant has also been criticized for the [[racism]] presented in some of his lesser-known papers, such as \"On the Use of Teleological Principles in Philosophy\" and \"On the Different Races of Man\". An advocate of scientific racism for much of his career, Kant's views on race changed significantly in the last decade of his life, and he ultimately rejected racial hierarchies and European [[colonialism]] in ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'' (1795)."
