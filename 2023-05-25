Some Federated Wiki implementations provide hosted services or allow users to connect to existing federated networks where they can contribute and collaborate without managing their own servers.

He is right that such a many-to-one map is implicitly present in the Laws. Due to the mark’s ambiguity, there are always several formulae of Boolean algebra corresponding to it. In order to remove this ambiguity, Frank and Cull improve, not degrade this algebra by translating it into the standard language. Only after this translation, one can establish an isomorphism between the two algebras. Apparently, Bricken thinks an isomorphism to be worse than a many-to-one map. We think the opposite is true, as an isomorphism – the establishment of a coherent context – allows for much more propositions. To repeat: Spencer Brown’s algebra is a blurred version of Boolean algebra, and it is Frank and Cull who sharpen this algebra to arrive at something mathematically meaningful."

Just like Enzensberger’s construction kit was supposed to show the emancipatory possibilities of the mass media, Kosub’s tools are supposed to guarantee the fulfillment of the calculus’ mathematical potential. While we cannot reliably determine from the slides available to us whether Kosub understands the re-entry in the same way as its creator, it is clear that he does in fact present meaningful definitions; his equation can have a solution. But is this what Spencer Brown was interested in, solving this particular equation? In our view, likely not. Indeed, he appears much more interested in those cases where the equation has no solution. Regardless, the original equation does not generally work; it only does in special cases."

This decentralized approach allows users to freely fork, modify, and merge content across different instances of the Federated Wiki system. It promotes a distributed and collaborative model of content creation and sharing."

Users can choose to host their own server instances, but there are also options for participating in Federated Wiki without the need for server administration. Some Federated Wiki implementations provide hosted services or allow users to connect to existing federated networks where they can contribute and collaborate without managing their own servers. So, while maintaining an independent server is an option, it is not mandatory to participate in Federated Wiki."

He is right that such a manyto-one map is implicitly present in the Laws. Due to the mark’s ambiguity, there are always several formulae of Boolean algebra corresponding to it. In order to remove this ambiguity, Frank and Cull improve, not degrade this algebra by translating it into the standard language. Only after this translation, one can establish an isomorphism between the two algebras. Apparently, Bricken thinks an isomorphism to be worse than a many-to-one map. We think the opposite is true, as an isomorphism – the establishment of a coherent context – allows for much more propositions. To repeat: Spencer Brown’s algebra is a blurred version of Boolean algebra, and it is Frank and Cull who sharpen this algebra to arrive at something mathematically meaningful."

        "text": "Bricken also criticizes that Cull and Frank – by replacing the blank by 0 “degrade” the many-to-one map of the Laws into an isomorphism, “permitting these blind men to claim that because they are holding onto the elephant’s leg, all elephants are trees” (quoted in Dible, 2009, p. 5). He is right that such a many-to-one map is implicitly present in the Laws. Due to the mark’s ambiguity, there are always several formulae of Boolean algebra corresponding to it. In order to remove this ambiguity, Frank and Cull improve, not degrade this algebra by translating it into the standard language. Only after this translation, one can establish an isomorphism between the two algebras. Apparently, Bricken thinks an isomorphism to be worse than a many-to-one map. We think the opposite is true, as an isomorphism – the establishment of a coherent context – allows for much more propositions. To repeat: Spencer Brown’s algebra is a blurred version of Boolean algebra, and it is Frank and Cull who sharpen this algebra to arrive at something mathematically meaningful."

Just like Enzensberger’s construction kit was supposed to show the emancipatory possibilities of the mass media, Kosub’s tools are supposed to guarantee the fulfillment of the calculus’ mathematical potential. While we cannot reliably determine from the slides available to us whether Kosub understands the re-entry in the same way as its creator, it is clear that he does in fact present meaningful definitions; his equation can have a solution. But is this what Spencer Brown was interested in, solving this particular equation? In our view, likely not. Indeed, he appears much more interested in those cases where the equation has no solution. Regardless, the original equation does not generally work; it only does in special cases."

As the classical representation of logical NOR, and hence the cross, is a truth table, and as one generally associates the cross with (the) distinction, Steffen conceptualizes the NOR as a tool for the distinction between true and false distinctions as well as for the translation between different social concepts of truth.

        "text": " In his essay “Meaning Negation,” Franz Hoegl takes up the cross to negate the idea that Spencer Brown’s cross is the primordium of logical negation. Franz shows how Spencer Brown appropriated and redesigned the Sheffer stroke to “write down” what the NOR transistors at Mullard Equipment Ltd. actually did in practice. As a notation of NOR, the cross does not presuppose but rather contains NOT. It is hence the perfect continence of the cross that motivates Franz to see the NOR typescript as a prelude to a programmatic aestheticization of mathematics and logics. In looking at the typescript, we see that for the human-computer Spencer Brown computation still meant manuscripture performed in a specifically controlled and, as Franz insists, particularly elegant way. Franz concludes that negation is an integral aspect of both the operation indicated by the drawn sign(s) and of the sign-process itself.\n"
