I think mostly about the rhizome, especially as it reterritorializes in higher education and in writing. Lately, I've become very interested in the desires of prepositions. I'm writing a bio here because Maha Bali wrote one on her federated wiki, and I'm trying to be more like Maha. Like Maha, I ran away from programming because I never really liked it. Unlike Maha, I don't really remember it. Here is my [[December Journal]]"
