      "text": "In September of 2019, a 20-year-old Japanese pop singer (whose name I'm omitting because almost all of the press reports similarly kept her anonymous) was attacked outside her apartment. Her attacker was a stalker named Hibiki Sato â a self-described fan whose obsession with the singer took a very violent turn. Physically, she was okay after a short recovery period; mentally and emotionally, it's difficult to tell how she managed to move forward."

      "text": "Unfortunately, many famous people have similar fears. Stalkers, particularly in a world where you're expected to share the details of your lives publicly, are a constant threat. Many celebrities take common-sense precautions as a result, such as hiding their home address as much as possible. That means not taking selfies in or near your home, and if you do, never showing any notable landmarks that a would-be attacker can use to sleuth out your location. By all accounts, the Sato's victim had taken all of these precautions, though. He, however, had seen this not as a barrier, but as a challenge. All he needed to do was stare into his victim's eyes."

      "text": "According to Japan Today, &quot;Sato said he'd been able to determine where his target lived by looking at selfies she'd posted on social media, specifically by looking at the reflection in her eyes of the surrounding scenery in outdoor shot.&quot; While those images were tiny and often not quite in focus, Sato was undeterred. He took whatever limited information he could glean from her eyes and cross-referenced it with images from Google Street View. At some point, the singer's eyes reflected an image of a railway stop and Sato was able to find that location; from there, he was able to increasingly narrow the radius around her apartment. Per CBS News, he &quot;also told police he studied seemingly innocuous details in videos the woman shot in her apartment, such as curtain placement and the direction of natural light entering the window, to figure out which building she lived in.&quot; Ultimately, he had enough information to make a 30 km (18 miles) trip from his home to where he correctly deduced she lived. Then, he just lay in wait for her to return home, and finally, he attacked."
