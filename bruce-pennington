Rock music was from Satan, and my long hair (in the '70's) was a sign of the end for me. When I cornered my Scout Master on these issues, he admitted that these weren't sins, but that there were certain circumstances we can put ourselves in that make it almost impossible not to sin. Well, what they were doing was teaching lies. When I found out, it destroyed their credibility. It made a permanent mark in my mind, and I've \"questioned authority\" ever since. I take no man's word for it, simply because he claims to be an expert. I investigate his claims. If they prove accurate, then he starts to build some credibility. This goes for religious as well as scientific experts.",

He always made an effort to convince the reader that since science would answer all our questions, we didn't need this silly idea of god. His claim seemed unscientific to me. The question of whether we needed god has nothing to do with whether god is real or not. So, I went on a quest. I threw everything out and wanted to know if god is real or not. The short of it is, that a couple of atheist-turned believers settled the matter for me. C.S.Lewis was an ancient literature professor at Cambridge who set out to prove that God did not exist, using pure logic, and proved just the opposite. Lee Strobel was the legal editor of the Chicago Tribune, in the '70s, and went to university professors in various subjects asking the usual tough questions about god, the bible, Jesus, etc., and came away with a huge stack of compelling evidence that it was all true.",

If you will permit me, I'd like to do this on the [[Programming Matters]] page. I have always appreciated the writings of [[Richard Drake]], but couldn't put a finger on why. Now, I think I know. In my search for Truth and meaning, I have been dealing with issues of fact. I have found many, and have been deeply affected by their cumulative impact. In my efforts to share my findings, though, I have mostly been dealing with fact. When [[Richard Drake]] writes, you hear his heart. It is what matters. All facts are just stepping stones to the heart. Like the computers that so many people are writing for, we can become like efficient machines if we ignore the heart (Think the Tin Man, of the <i>Wizard of Oz</i>). If our fact-gathering never gets to our hearts, it is frivolous, a waste of our time.

When I cornered my Scout Master on these issues, he admitted that these weren't sins, but that there were certain circumstances we can put ourselves in that make it almost impossible not to sin. Well, what they were doing was teaching lies. When I found out, it destroyed their credibility. It made a permanent mark in my mind, and I've \"questioned authority\" ever since. I take no man's word for it, simply because he claims to be an expert. I investigate his claims. If they prove accurate, then he starts to build some credibility. This goes for religious as well as scientific experts.",

The question of whether we needed god has nothing to do with whether god is real or not. So, I went on a quest. I threw everything out and wanted to know if god is real or not. The short of it is, that a couple of atheist-turned believers settled the matter for me. C.S.Lewis was an ancient literature professor at Cambridge who set out to prove that God did not exist, using pure logic, and proved just the opposite. Lee Strobel was the legal editor of the Chicago Tribune, in the '70s, and went to university professors in various subjects asking the usual tough questions about god, the bible, Jesus, etc., and came away with a huge stack of compelling evidence that it was all true.",

In my search for Truth and meaning, I have been dealing with issues of fact. I have found many, and have been deeply affected by their cumulative impact. In my efforts to share my findings, though, I have mostly been dealing with fact. When [[Richard Drake]] writes, you hear his heart. It is what matters. All facts are just stepping stones to the heart. Like the computers that so many people are writing for, we can become like efficient machines if we ignore the heart (Think the Tin Man, of the <i>Wizard of Oz</i>). If our fact-gathering never gets to our hearts, it is frivolous, a waste of our time.
