In 1965 Angel and his sister Isabel established the Peña de los Parra in Santiago, an artistic space where they could sing for a small audience and experiment with the Nueva Canción (new song) movement, a form of music that linked Chilean folk traditions to the social and political movements of the time. Whereas traditional folk music was suitable for parties or dancing, music in the Nueva Canción vein reflected the lives of Chilean workers, peasants, and shantytown dwellers, and the difficulties they faced, as well as themes such as world peace, friendship, and solidarity. When Allende came to power, the Parra family and the Peña de los Parra became a cultural center for the left and a musical inspiration for the entire country."

Beer had greater ambitions for the song, hoping that it would make cybernetics and the Cybersyn Project more accessible and appealing to Chilean workers. As one of the most recognizable voices of the revolution, Parra’s voice would frame the system as a form of science for the people, something that was culturally Chilean and that could connect the project to the broader social changes that were taking place.

        "text": "Beer began to explore how concepts and language from the Chilean revolution might be used to communicate ideas from management cybernetics. In September he drafted a small, illustrated booklet titled Five Principles for the People toward Good Government that explored how cybernetic thinking could improve government practices in ways that went beyond economic management. The principles contained in the booklet reflected common themes in Beer’s writings: the booklet called for an end to bureaucracy, greater transparency, increased personal responsibility, clearer government organization, and planning for the future. Technology played an important role in achieving these goals. “The wishes of the people will be made known to the Government at all times,” it read. “We shall use TECHNOLOGY, which belongs to the people, to do it.” Beer viewed the booklet much as he viewed the folksong that Angel Parra wrote about cybernetics and social change—another attempt to educate the Chilean people about the promise of cybernetics by putting it into a language that people could understand. For Beer, making Cybersyn populist was central to making Cybersyn socialist."

        "text": "Angel Parra was a member of one of Chile’s most beloved musical families. His mother was Violetta Parra, one of the most famous Latin American folk musicians. In 1965 Angel and his sister Isabel established the Peña de los Parra in Santiago, an artistic space where they could sing for a small audience and experiment with the Nueva Canción (new song) movement, a form of music that linked Chilean folk traditions to the social and political movements of the time. Whereas traditional folk music was suitable for parties or dancing, music in the Nueva Canción vein reflected the lives of Chilean workers, peasants, and shantytown dwellers, and the difficulties they faced, as well as themes such as world peace, friendship, and solidarity. When Allende came to power, the Parra family and the Peña de los Parra became a cultural center for the left and a musical inspiration for the entire country."

Beer kept coming to the Peña de los Parra with increasing frequency and started hanging out with a small, select group of Angel Parra’s friends, including José Miguel Insulza, the future vice president of Chile and secretary general of the Organization of American States. Parra did not speak English, but others at the Peña de los Parra did, including Cañete, who sometimes accompanied Beer and served as his translator. “Beer asked me if I would write a song for [Project Cybersyn],” Parra said. “For me the project was like a pregnancy, a pregnancy of Popular Unity.” He deepened the comparison: “If you bring a child into the world, you have to be responsible, you cannot abandon it. I was saying that the computer system was also going to be like this.”"

        "text": "According to Beer, both he and Flores stressed the political aspects of the project during the meeting. This message distressed many of the professionals involved, who viewed Cybersyn as a highly technical project that was politically neutral. “It became obvious that there would have to be major changes in the management team that was actually implementing the results of the cybernetics,” Beer wrote. He and Flores started discussing how they might make Cybersyn less technocratic and more political. These opposing interpretations of Project Cybersyn would resurface repeatedly in the months ahead."
