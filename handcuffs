I am considering renouncing my Swiss citizenship.\"\n\nSchaner has since filed a supervisory complaint against the Stawa and lodged an appeal against the penalty order. He is demanding an administrative investigation and compensation from Marcel Hess at the expense of the canton of Basel-Stadt. In response to an inquiry from BaZ, the Stawa stated that it does not comment on pending proceedings. And the Department of Justice and Police writes: \"The accusation of anti-Semitism is serious, of course such accusations are investigated.\" Regarding the accusation that Hess was denied kosher food, the department writes that only in the case of \"longer stays\" in the Waaghof, \"of course, one takes into account eating habits and religious rules."

As this is a case of child abduction, we would appreciate it if you could explain why Mr. Marcel Hess is suspected of false accusation.\""
