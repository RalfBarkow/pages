Rogers (2010) identified five categories (groups) of adopters called innovators, early adopters, early and late majority, and laggards. The early majority expects and waits for certain members of the group of early adopters called “opinion leaders” to demonstrate and communicate the advantages. Furthermore, the late majority not only wants the advantages demonstrated; they are also waiting for the right opportunity. Hence, the late majority group can be seen as having resistance to change but are in fact just waiting for the right opportunity. ([[So What If ChatGPT Wrote It?]], p. 10)"
