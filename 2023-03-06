DOI 10.26041/fhnw-3966. Die Digitalisierung macht keinen Halt vor Schulen und zwingt diese, sich einer Veränderung \nzu stellen. So hat sich das Erziehungsdepartement des Kantons Basel-Stadt zur Aufgabe \ngemacht, diese Veränderung anzugehen und hat ein Pilotprojekt gestartet. Die \nSekundarschule St. Alban Basel-Stadt war Teil dieses Pilotprojekts. Die vorliegende Arbeit \nbeschäftigt sich mit der Frage, inwiefern der Veränderungsprozess aus Sicht der \nSchulleitung und Lehrpersonen der Sekundarschule St. Alban Basel-Stadt gut verlief, was \nschwierig war und wo sie Verbesserungspotential sehen. Mittels qualitativer Inhaltsanalyse \nvon 9 Interviews, welche als Grundlage das Acht-Phasen-Modell nach Kotter (1996/2011) \nhatten, zeigte sich, dass die Covid-19-Pandemie positiven Einfluss auf den \nVeränderungsprozess hatte. Die Kooperation und Unterstützung im Kollegium wurden \ngefördert und die Nutzung der digitalen Endgeräte gestärkt. Die grösste Herausforderung \nwar das Planen und das Kommunizieren der Vision. Hier besteht Optimierungsbedarf. Mit \netwas mehr Vorgaben des Erziehungsdepartements des Kantons Basel-Stadt wäre dies \nmöglich. Accepted: 2021-12-02T06:43:10Z"

This had first of all a mathematical basis insofar as one tried to work with mathematical functions, but metaphor is also interesting independently of that and, incidentally, one of the oldest sources of systemic thinking, in use long before the word \"system\" was given a certain prominence, long, of course, before one could speak of \"systems theory\" in the true meaning. I don't know exactly when it started, but the equilibrium metaphor is already in use as a matter of course in the 17th century in the idea of the \"balance of trade\", motivates towards the end of the century also the idea of an international, especially a European balance of nations (or political factors), and finds beyond that a general and relatively indefinite use."

      "text": "Looking back on this development, we can say that it can be characterized by a distinction, namely the distinction between a stable state and a disturbance. Normally, the accent is placed on stability. An equilibrium is thought of as stable, responding only to disturbances, and responding in such a way that either the old equilibrium is restored or a new state of equilibrium is reached. The metaphor presupposes some mechanics, some implementation, some infrastructure that ensures that equilibrium is maintained. From there, the idea that equilibrium theories are stability theories is dominant. However, if you look more closely, and there are such hints as early as the 17th century, this becomes questionable. If one is guided by the idea of a balance, a state of equilibrium of two scales, it immediately becomes clear that this equilibrium is extraordinarily easy to disturb. One need only add a small weight to one of the scales, and the balance is debalanced."

      "text": "That is, the idea of equilibrium can be thought of as a theory that designates and also localizes the susceptibility of a system to disturbance - you know what to do if you want to disturb the equilibrium. From a point of view that will come up again and again in the lecture, this theory is a theory of a specific distinction rather than a theory of a desirable state or a particular kind of object. The concept of equilibrium contains a theory that has interest in seeing how the relation of disturbance and stability can be ordered. Perhaps one can even say, but this goes beyond the literature, that it has an interest in seeing how the ratio of perturbation to stability can be increased so that a system is still stable despite being highly perturbable. If you project that to mathematics, the interest turns to the question of what mathematical equations can be used to read such a ratio. Nevertheless, this moment of perturbation has been seen repeatedly in the tradition and also in the more recent use of equilibrium theories, but the accent has clearly been on stability. As if keeping a system stable is a value, and as if the institutions that guarantee equilibrium must strive to keep the system stable. This is especially true of economic theory, of the notion of economic equilibrium, of a balance of various economic factors. Here, doubts have also set in as to whether one can speak of equilibrium as a stable state at all, if one includes reality, if one does not only have mathematical functions in mind, but imagines how real systems, such as economic systems, such as production systems, can be stable."

According to this, an economic system could only be stable if it either produces too many goods in order to be able to offer something in any case when there is a demand on the market, or if, conversely, it produces too many buyers and too few goods in order to have buyers in any case who, if enough goods are available, will buy them. [[Jänos Kornai]], a Hungarian economist, has developed such anti-equilibrium concepts. One can see that this maps respectively the Western and Eastern economies within the capitalist-socialist controversy: Either goods must be kept scarce and buyers or demand abundant, then you are in the socialist system, or conversely buyers must be scarce and goods abundant, then you are in the capitalist system. In any case, we are dealing here with a version of nonequilibrium theory that differs from classical and neoclassical economics in that it moves stability from equilibrium to [[Disequilibrium]]."

(The statistician is not at all worried by this. He uses series of random numbers appropriate in length to the purpose he has in hand, and he does so only, in Mr. Spencer Brown's own words, \"to save the experimenter from his own dishonesty\".) Mr. Spencer Brown treats this fact as a new discovery, works it very hard, and uses it in conjunction with the interpretation of the probability of the observations, in testing a hypothesis, as a direct measure of belief, to reach some very strange conclusions. He does not discuss the ideas underlying statistical decisions at all, though he gropes for their basis in a passage at the end of his Chapter XI. He does not seem to have heard of the theory of estimation for the parameters of a mathematically specified model-there is no other way in which I can interprethis truly astonishing ChapterXII, 322pages long, which contains the modest statement: \" Thus totters the whole edifice of Bernoullian probability\" and ends with \". . . Bernoulli's theorem \" [a valid mathematical theorem] \". . . is one of the most flagrant metaphysical excesses ever to pass as an adjunct to modern science\". To this one can only say something like \" Well, well! Whatever philosophical merits this book may have, it is of no value to the statistician."

DOI 10.26041/fhnw-3966. Die Digitalisierung macht keinen Halt vor Schulen und zwingt diese, sich einer Veränderung \nzu stellen. So hat sich das Erziehungsdepartement des Kantons Basel-Stadt zur Aufgabe \ngemacht, diese Veränderung anzugehen und hat ein Pilotprojekt gestartet. Die \nSekundarschule St. Alban Basel-Stadt war Teil dieses Pilotprojekts.

Normally, the accent is placed on stability. An equilibrium is thought of as stable, responding only to disturbances, and responding in such a way that either the old equilibrium is restored or a new state of equilibrium is reached. The metaphor presupposes some mechanics, some implementation, some infrastructure that ensures that equilibrium is maintained. From there, the idea that equilibrium theories are stability theories is dominant. However, if you look more closely, and there are such hints as early as the 17th century, this becomes questionable. If one is guided by the idea of a balance, a state of equilibrium of two scales, it immediately becomes clear that this equilibrium is extraordinarily easy to disturb. One need only add a small weight to one of the scales, and the balance is debalanced."

From a point of view that will come up again and again in the lecture, this theory is a theory of a specific distinction rather than a theory of a desirable state or a particular kind of object. The concept of equilibrium contains a theory that has interest in seeing how the relation of disturbance and stability can be ordered. Perhaps one can even say, but this goes beyond the literature, that it has an interest in seeing how the ratio of perturbation to stability can be increased so that a system is still stable despite being highly perturbable. If you project that to mathematics, the interest turns to the question of what mathematical equations can be used to read such a ratio. Nevertheless, this moment of perturbation has been seen repeatedly in the tradition and also in the more recent use of equilibrium theories, but the accent has clearly been on stability. As if keeping a system stable is a value, and as if the institutions that guarantee equilibrium must strive to keep the system stable. This is especially true of economic theory, of the notion of economic equilibrium, of a balance of various economic factors. Here, doubts have also set in as to whether one can speak of equilibrium as a stable state at all, if one includes reality, if one does not only have mathematical functions in mind, but imagines how real systems, such as economic systems, such as production systems, can be stable."

        "text": "The equilibrium model, at any rate, establishes a strand of developments toward a general systems theory. However, this was not a new discovery in the 1950s, but only a variant to which one could fall back if necessary. New were two other sets of problems, which then influenced the further development of systems theory more strongly than this equilibrium theory. New was above all the question, coming from thermodynamics, how systems can be preserved at all, if one has to assume that physics, at least the physics of closed systems, tends to generate entropy, i.e. to dissolve all distinctions, to bring about a distinctionless state or, physically speaking, to bring about a state in which there is no more usable energy, i.e. no energy that can generate any distinctions. If this is a general physical law, how is it possible to explain the facts of the physical, chemical, biological, social world at all? How is it possible to explain that there is order and that, limiting the perspective to a few billion years, one cannot see that such a development towards entropy is actually taking place? In other words, how is negentropy to be explained as a deviation from the state of entropy, when the laws of physics in themselves run toward entropy? In this question one had in mind that the entropy laws presuppose a closed system, and one imagined, for example, the world as a closed system into which nothing enters from the outside and from which nothing can be led out from the inside."

        "text": "This model may have its validity as a world model, but it is inapplicable for all relations within the world. It is the model of a closed system, and such systems are not found in the world, at least not when it comes to living systems, to mental and social systems, that is, at least not when we consider the area that interests us in this lecture. Therefore, the idea of closed systems was negated for the field of biology and sociology and instead a theory of open systems was developed: open systems because one wanted to explain why entropy does not occur and why order is established. Now openness means in any case exchange with the environment, but depending on whether one thinks of biological or organic systems or of sense-oriented systems, i.e. of social systems (communication systems) and of mental systems (consciousness and the like), this idea of exchange takes different forms. For biological systems, one thinks primarily of energy input and output of useless energy; for sense systems, one thinks primarily of exchange of information. A sense system draws information from its environment, interprets, if we may say so, surprises, and is built into a network of other systems that responds to this information-processing system. The basic condition that explains entropy is the same in both cases, namely exchange relations between system and environment. This is what the term open system refers to."
