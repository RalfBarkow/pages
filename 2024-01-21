This also makes it possible to introduce the concept of disorganization – detached from any hierarchical world architecture and related to the internal defects of an organism. At around the same time, biology and demography were adapting to a new, individual-based concept of \"population\", which took away much of the significance of the old scheme of species and genera and prepared the ground for the 19th century theory of evolution. For the explication of the internal organization, however, the scheme of a whole consisting of parts remained, i.e. the assumption of a harmony that is coordinated with it, almost in the old sense of an ordinata concordantia. And then one could also use the distinction between ends and means and say that the arrangement into a whole is the end and the connection of the parts is the means. This in turn allowed Kant to introduce vague concepts such as \"[[Interaction]]\" between parts and the idea that the whole is its own end."

      "text": "After this first attempt and after this thoroughly positive colouring, the 19th century made use of the concept of organization primarily at the level of social theory. Modern, post-revolutionary society sought its own form – partly in contrast to the aristocratic societies of the European tradition, partly as a defensive concept against the unrest caused by the French Revolution. It is about reconstruction on new, promising foundations. \"La philosophie du siede dernier a ete revolutionnaire, celle du XIXe siede doit etre organisatrice\",6 Saint-Simon proclaimed his programme, and Auguste Comte would endow the same idea with characteristics such as \"scientificity\", \"positivity\" and \"sociology\". Despite the conscious search for historical distance and a new, reliable program, the conceptual elements of ordering parts into a functioning whole remain intact. However, the concept of organization now also separates out desiderata such as \"social\" and \"solidarity\",7 which have a good chance of expressing the inadequacy of mere organization and becoming desideratum concepts, even oppositional concepts. A company should, as they say today, also take care of the social concerns of its employees – as if joint work is not yet \"social\" without further ado. While retaining its original characteristics, the concept of organization now runs into a bifurcation when applied to society. It marks an inadequacy, a dissatisfaction with the typical characteristics of modern society, together with concepts such as commodity, market, exchange and finally money. In 1887, Tönnies published \"Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft\" (Community and Society), a publication whose unconventional terminology was not very successful, but whose dualization captured the mood of the times and had a formative effect for a long time. Parsons would still organize his \"pattern variables\" according to this pattern."

In the first decades of the 20th century, general theories of organization were still being published on this basis, but they no longer addressed the social problems that preoccupied sociology and retreated to special issues of good work organization or very formal analyses of relationships. \"Organization\" and also \"management\" are now words that allow knowledge to be extracted from the immediate work process and made independent as knowledge of organization and supervision. Organizational knowledge and the knowledge of \"scientific management\" now claim to be more than the sum of the working knowledge required to carry out the activities."

On the one hand, trust in the possibility of organizing rationally (in the sense of in the best possible way) on the basis of principles has been lost – in business management theories as well as in sociological organizational research. On the other hand, a very rich empirical organizational research and a lively management consultancy that is constantly bringing new buzzwords onto the market has created a complexity that can no longer be organized in the old forms of theories. To make matters worse, it is no longer enough to use the older organizational theories to orientate oneself on a few types, primarily production companies and public administration. You also have to think about symphony orchestras, newspaper editorial offices, banks, political parties, leisure clubs, schools, hospitals and prisons. How is alcoholic therapy organized? Or a library? Or freight transport with containers, which has fundamentally changed the organization of both ports and ships? Or waste collection with the current tasks of sorting and recycling? If there can be a general theory of organized social systems at all in view of this diversity, then it can certainly no longer be based on the conceptual instruments discussed so far. Thinking in terms of wholes and their parts has dissolved without being replaced as a theory of complex systems. The question is whether it has to stay that way or whether it is possible to formulate a general theory of organization using completely different theoretical tools."

The World Bank, NATO, the institutions of the European Union and international non-governmental organizations have given themselves concrete purposes and goals and measure themselves against their achievement."

In the first decades of the 20th century, general theories of organization were still being published on this basis, but they no longer addressed the social problems that preoccupied sociology and retreated to special issues of good work organization or very formal analyses of relationships. \"Organization\" and also \"management\" are now words that allow knowledge to be extracted from the immediate work process and made independent as knowledge of organization and supervision. Organizational knowledge and the knowledge of \"scientific management\" now claim to be more than the sum of the working knowledge required to carry out the activities."

On the one hand, trust in the possibility of organizing rationally (in the sense of in the best possible way) on the basis of principles has been lost - in business management theories as well as in sociological organizational research. On the other hand, a very rich empirical organizational research and a lively management consultancy that is constantly bringing new buzzwords onto the market has created a complexity that can no longer be organized in the old forms of theories. To make matters worse, it is no longer enough to use the older organizational theories to orientate oneself on a few types, primarily production companies and public administration. You also have to think about symphony orchestras, newspaper editorial offices, banks, political parties, leisure clubs, schools, hospitals and prisons. How is alcoholic therapy organized? Or a library? Or freight transport with containers, which has fundamentally changed the organization of both ports and ships? Or waste collection with the current tasks of sorting and recycling? If there can be a general theory of organized social systems at all in view of this diversity, then it can certainly no longer be based on the conceptual instruments discussed so far. Thinking in terms of wholes and their parts has dissolved without being replaced as a theory of complex systems. The question is whether it has to stay that way or whether it is possible to formulate a general theory of organization using completely different theoretical tools."
