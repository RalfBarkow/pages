But one could also run down the idea of the all-overseeing theory the old expression cleverness and thereby probably hit pretty close what Luhmann himself (in his art of modest-dry irony) thought of this theory. It is clever in the traditional sense of 'separating', of 'distinguishing'. In its own special way, it provides labyrinthine networked distinctions that can be used for purposes of designation. Or in other words: It is an observation instrument enriched with high complexity, with which the fields that someone wants to observe can be 'mixed up' and swirled (verwirbeln) within the framework of an abundance of distinction finesses, which even allow to observe the observer as well."
