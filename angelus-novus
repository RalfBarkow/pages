Where we see a chain of events, he sees a single catastrophe that piles wreckage upon wreckage and throws it at his feet. He would like to linger, to wake the dead and reassemble the shattered. But a storm blows out of Paradise, which has caught his wings and is so strong that the angel can no longer close them. This storm drives him inexorably into the future, to which he turns his back, while the pile of rubble before him grows into the sky. What we call [[Progress]] is this storm."
