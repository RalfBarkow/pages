Emphasis on the intention and the process challenges how we usually construct learning opportunities, with a particular product in mind. Thompson uses Lao Tzu's words to define further this notion: \"If you tell me, I will listen. If you show me, I will see. But if you let me experience, I will learn.\""

Intention and process without prescription of a product but, knowing a product will emerge. No prescribed research path, product or assignment, or task to produce. A path to reimagine the way we view the demonstration of learning. "

        "text": "Our experiments with the DiG learning framework are highlighting some interesting facets for us. We’re noting that, as teachers, we need to be asking ourselves if we are focused on the learning process or the final product. We’re questioning if learning is a process, why we put so much emphasis on one event in that process, the product. Our kids have been grappling with this too, this is a new way of learning for them also. They’re now beginning to delight in the fact that they can create any artefact they can imagine to share their discoveries, remembering the intent, to awaken wonder in others."

Our learners are encouraged to be inquisitors, researchers, builders, artists, scientists, critics, re-imaginers, and are unleashing their creative genius. Education is looking different for them. It’s being reimagined. Importantly, they’re reshaping their idea of learning, too, and finding greater joy in the process."
