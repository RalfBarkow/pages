This is certainly a well-equilibrated dual that suits the needs of the mass media, but promises little help otherwise. Religious fundamentalists may set their own distinctions. What was once the mystery of God to be worshipped, setting limits, is thereby more and more replaced by polemics: one knows what one is against, and that is enough. Compared to this, the science-specific scheme of idealization and deviation has a lot going for it. But it is noticeable that this is also a distinction like that of ethics and scandal or that of local and global or of orthodox and opponents. With a little more distance one can therefore ask: why is the one and not the other distinction preferred? If it is not possible without distinctions, because without distinctions nothing can be observed at all: what speaks for the choice of a certain distinction?\n\n"
