At the app-level, feature quantity is kept stable because it only needs to satisfy one app. At the standard library level, it is kept stable by external standards bodies and the slow process of shared review and adoption. There is too few forces to cap off runaway feature counts for company-wide generic-intended libraries. It just seems easier to copy a bare-bones or similar one, and modify it for local app needs rather than integrate our particular needed features into the central copy. This is still reuse, it is just \"copy-reuse\" instead of \"reference-reuse\".",
