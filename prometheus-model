The first explorers trusted the records of the ancient Egyptians, who described their southern neighbors as primitive black barbarians. Since this viewpoint was ingrained in the minds of Western intellectuals anyway, it was assumed that the magnificent structures in Sudan came from the Egyptians. Because of this historical misinterpretation, the Kingdom of Kush remained misunderstood for a long time.\n\nThe civil war in Sudan made new excavations practically impossible. In recent years, however, a turning point has been reached: Today, international archaeologists are again researching along the Nile in Sudan and reconstructing the forgotten history of the Kingdom of the Black Pharaohs. The documentary offers the rare opportunity to look over the archaeologists' shoulders as they work and to learn about state-of-the-art excavation methods.\n\nResearchers must work quickly if they are to restore the Kingdom of Kush to its deserved place in history, as climate change and industrialization in the region are putting relics from a bygone era at risk. Modern drone footage is used to illustrate the exploration of underground burial chambers and the discovery of a sunken city, as well as the size of the Kingdom of Kush. In the process, the theory that Egypt was the only significant civilization in Africa is challenged. In fact, Kush was an African superpower that has simply been passed over by historians - until today."

Because of this historical misinterpretation, the Kingdom of Kush remained misunderstood for a long time.\n\nThe civil war in Sudan made new excavations practically impossible. In recent years, however, a turning point has been reached: Today, international archaeologists are again researching along the Nile in Sudan and reconstructing the forgotten history of the Kingdom of the Black Pharaohs. The documentary offers the rare opportunity to look over the archaeologists' shoulders as they work and to learn about state-of-the-art excavation methods.\n\nResearchers must work quickly if they are to restore the Kingdom of Kush to its deserved place in history, as climate change and industrialization in the region are putting relics from a bygone era at risk. Modern drone footage is used to illustrate the exploration of underground burial chambers and the discovery of a sunken city, as well as the size of the Kingdom of Kush. In the process, the theory that Egypt was the only significant civilization in Africa is challenged. In fact, Kush was an African superpower that has simply been passed over by historians - until today."
