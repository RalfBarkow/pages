Editing abstractions like cursors and code-folding are reimagined as syntactic scaffolding in a meta-grammar of syntactic affordances. Fructure lets language providers specify syntactic forms and semantic refactorings as production and transformation rules in a tiny term-rewriting DSL. Lessening reliance on after-the-fact correction or ad-hoc autocompletion, program creation consists rather of a guided search in the space of valid programs. Over the hood, my emphasis is on visual and kinetic appeal; creating a fun, fluid editing process with an eye to discoverability."
