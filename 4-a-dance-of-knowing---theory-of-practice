        "text": "---\n\nNext:[[Radical professionalism, facilitative practice]], emergent relations of cultural production\nMy perception of radical professionalism emerged simultaneously from theorisations and from participating in formations; this itself is probably  a characteristic of this historical movement in an emergent class-fraction. The theorisations of emergent practice included, diversely, 70s’ accounts like Gorz on ‘the new working class’ and the Ehrenreichs on ‘the professional-managerial class’ ::\\[Gorz xxx, Ehrenreich & Ehrenreich xxx]::, broadly post-colonial projects of radical literacy like Freire and Illich ::\\{Freire xxx, Illich xxx}::, and my own historical investigation ::\\[Hales 1978, *Operational research and the forces of production - A Marxist analysis of science and ideology*]:: of an inter-war ‘Left scientists’ movement in Britain (JD Bernal was a prominent figure ::\\[Werskey 2007]::), which evolved into post-war managerialist, neo-Fabian formations in ‘management science’ and the management of innovation (the kind of phenomenon which, within socialist culture, Stephen Yeo tags as its ‘collectivist’ streams ::\\[Yeo xxx, *Three socialisms*]::). \n\nThe 70s’ radical-professional formations included radical science, radical philosophers, radical economists, radical educators, radical midwives, radical planners, radical technology and many other self-designated movements; the campaign around the forces of production in Lucas Aerospace and other rank-&-file trade union ‘alternative strategy’ ventures; but most immediately, a distributed community of workers in British trade-union and community research and information centres (including law centres) such as Leeds TUCRIC and Coventry Workshop (which latter arose from an important Home Office-funded anti-poverty programme, the Community Development Project ::\\[CDP xxx]::). In the USA, similar forces and facilitative aesthetics have been at work for example in the formation of the Highlander Folk School during the Depression, which during the 50s and into the 60s (as Highlander College) schooled a significant cohort of leaders and pioneers in the civil rights movement.\n\nThis latter ‘community development’ culture was significantly and self-consciously mobilised in the Industry and Employment formation at the GLC in the 80s, in the popular planning unit and the community development unit, alongside the academic Left economists who might have been more conventionally obvious recruits. At the Enterprise Board (the GLC’s investment bank) this culture of facilitative process was sometimes dismissively referred to as ‘the sociologists at the GLC’, but its exclusion from the bank was one of the latter’s errors of self-identification, I think. It had consequences, for example, in the tech-centredness and lack of direction of most of the Technology Networks that were founded on an awkward adaptation of the Lucas ‘product’ vision. By the time the 80s’ GLC adventure was under way, I was very aware (as manifest in 1980’s LTW) that a genre and a skillset of rank-&-file *facilitation* was emergent, among formally educated young people who might otherwise be expected to be climbing corporate ladders. This resonated too, with strands of practice more corporately oriented and  professionalist, originating in a preceding generation, like ‘action research’, and ‘behaviour in groups’ in organisation development (arising jointly in the 40s and 50s in the US - eg Kurt Lewin - and at the Tavistock Institute in Britain). \n\nI felt, and feel now, that this culture of *skilled facilitative capability and intention*, in support of the self-making and self-organising of formations of ‘ordinary working people’, is one of the great political-cultural innovations of the post-war, education-boom, activist generation; and that it has a lot of legs, still. Broadening this out, I have a sense of a family of emergent altered relations of production, in the field of cultural production, as follows:\n- *Organic intellectual practice* - Was highlighted for example in the 70s by Illich as ‘vernacular’ capability, in *Tools for conviviality* and *Deschooling society*. Organic intellectual practice is a discovery of the Fordist era ::\\[Gramsci xxx]:: which stands in opposition to the professional-managerial class of Fordist and post-Fordist society. Also, in opposition to revolutionary vanguard, priestly caste, bardic elite, etc, and the ‘collectivist’ stream of socialist aesthetics.\n- *Free association, self-organising*. These are highlighted for example by Paulo Freire in his practice of conscientisation, which stands in opposition to the authoritative State, and the nanny State. It is not-the-cultural-industries. This mode is a discovery of the working class, with mutuals, coops, soviets and communes. Proto-socialist associationism ripples on as ‘global civil society’ (with its contradictions s, including ‘collectivism’).\n- *Commoning* - the curating, stewarding and enjoying by all members, of material or cultural resources - is highlighted by the contemporary movement for commons. Michel Bauwens and the Peer-to-Peer Foundation promote a perspective founded in P2P production organisation, which is a discovery of the post-post-Fordist period. P2P asserts the primacy of the mutual sector. The Commons Strategies Group and Commons Transition ::\\[Commons Transition xxx]:: are more centrally oriented to mutuality in the associationist sense; Bauwens is a co-founder of CSG but David Bollier & Silke Helfrich have done the anthropological fieldwork and specifically emphasise stewarding as the pivot (of which, the ‘agile’ P2P mode is a somewhat tech-reductionist, geek-elite version) ::\\[Bollier & Helfrich xxx]::. Commoning stands in opposition to the enclosing bureaucratising State, the consumerist individualist patriarchal household, and the capitalist monetising market; it constitutes the deepest kind of alternative to the status quo of provisioning for subsistence and wellbeing.\n- *Facilitation* is one of the great political discoveries of the educated baby-boomer, post-Fordist activist generation - an extension of rank-&-file labour movement activism into community development and disciplined, fluent self-reflection on means and ends. Facilitation stands for the autodidact and in opposition to preconceptualisation and managerial hierarchy. It’s a close cousin of organic intellectual practice (all of these RoPs here are close kin) but highlights the active cultivating of capability and insight as a skilled, situated practice in its own right. It’s part of the zeitgeist of mid C20 Human Potential, person (child)-centred learning and the ‘reflective practitioner’ aesthetic ::\\[Schõn xxx]::.\n- *Participatory design of infrastructure* - Communities of participatory design began to develop particularly in the 80s, with precedents in organic-intellectual and facilitative practice, and the free-association traditions, but but broadened and deepened; and became more visible with the advent of post-Fordist IT infrastructure, when entire work-infrastructures (and later, systems of ‘platforms’) could be generated from the design office and, later, by hacking. Participatory design is anti-statist and anti-corporate, and continues to sprout new forms; for example ‘social innovation’ circles as pioneered by Participle \\[[http://www.participle.net/]], and the design justice movement in the USA. The movement that promotes strict P2P protocols in web and open apps architecture is a version of participatory design also, but permeated by a hacking aesthetic - which is another thing, I would say, standing in a problematic relationship with ‘design’. Capability in protocolling, however, is fundamentally important in infrastructuring; a concern of the Faculty of stewarding.\nAll these emergent altered relations of cultural production - that is, production of radical labour power - require instantiation in patterns of landscape §2."
