The idea itself did not catch on. The idea of tree based file manager is you index a folder or set of folders, for e.g. if you index all you project folder, it will gets you a number for e.g. 24,000 files, you can then browse particular branch, or all index files, and operate on them directly including applying filters, so I can browse my entire projects, find all the text files, copy it to different folder. You can easily discard an index. This tool is just too powerful for bulk operations. There is similarity to Fedwiki neighborhood concept, indexes are fedwiki loading of related sites, in Tree based FM you can query your indexed files and operate on them."
