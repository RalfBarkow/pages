Critics of architectural education condemn how it has focused for one century on making tiny cardboard models and judging aesthetics based on them. Practitioners interested in adaptation have long argued for re-introducing real-world experience into design. This could be done through full-scale mockups, as suggested in [[Community Mockup]]. Now, with virtual reality methods finally reaching a high level of sophistication and low enough cost to be used by everyone, the situation is changing. Any individual can participate in modeling the sensory experience of a proposed design, which no longer depends upon “experts” imposing an unproven design top-down. We need no longer ignore the users’ emotional and psychological reactions in order to focus exclusively on the designers’ own aesthetic judgments.",
