From a basement in Ohio, guided literally by his dreams and his innate love of [[pattern]], Zellweger developed an extraordinary visual system—called [[the “Logic Alphabet”]]—in which a group of specially designed letter-shapes can be manipulated like puzzles to reveal the geometric [[patterns]] underpinning logic."
