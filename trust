Even experts are susceptible to being convinced. Although there is widespread agreement between philosophers and AI experts that AI chatbots are not sentient, their existence and use raises pressing ethical questions. Should we outlaw AI designed to pass itself as human, for much the same reason that we outlaw [[Counterfeit Money]]?"
