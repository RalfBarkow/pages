From the viewpoint of simplification, this equation says more implicitly than explicitly. Why? Because it states that no other equation is needed. It says, for instance, that the force of attraction between two bodies is in no way dependent on the presence of a third body, so that only pairs of bodies need be considered in turn, and then all of their effects may be added up (Figure 1.3)."

When all three interacted at the same time, their behavior could be predicted by summing their pairwise behaviors.

Such a separation of a system into noninteracting subsystems is an extremely important technique known to all developed sciencesâ€”and to systems theorists as well. To understand the power of such a separation, we need only recall the Square Law of Computation. If solving a system of n equations takes n2 units of computation, n separate single equations taken one at a time will take only n of the same units (Figure 1.4)."

His research centers on the development of practical methods for systems thinking and dynamic modeling of complex systems, with applications to organizational learning and change, operations management, corporate strategy, and nonlinear dynamics in a wide range of systems, from supply chains to scientific revolutions. He has pioneered the development of **management flight simulators** of corporate and economic systems. These **flight simulators** are used in research to understand and improve managerial decision making in complex dynamic systems; more importantly, they are now widely used by corporations and universities around the world for teaching, problem solving, and policy design. Professor Sterman discovered system dynamics modeling in high school, studied it as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College, and received his PhD from MIT. He has been awarded the Jay W. Forrester Prize, given for the best published work in the field of system dynamics over the prior five years, and has four times won awards for teaching excellence from the students of the Sloan School."

This simplification would mean that, to understand the behavior of a family of three, she would study the behavior of the father and mother together, the father and son together, and the mother and son together. When all three interacted at the same time, their behavior could be predicted by summing their pairwise behaviors. Unfortunately for the psychologist, it is only in mechanics and a few other sciences that superposition of pairwise interactions can produce successful predictions."

Such a separation of a system into noninteracting subsystems is an extremely important technique known to all developed sciencesâ€”and to systems theorists as well. To understand the power of such a separation, we need only recall the Square Law of Computation. If solving a system of n equations takes n2 units of computation, n separate single equations taken one at a time will take only n of the same units (Figure 1.4)."

Spencer Standish Professor of Management at the Sloan School of Management of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Director of MITâ€™s System Dynamics Group. His research centers on the development of practical methods for systems thinking and dynamic modeling of complex systems, with applications to organizational learning and change, operations management, corporate strategy, and nonlinear dynamics in a wide range of systems, from supply chains to scientific revolutions. He has pioneered the development of management flight simulators of corporate and economic systems. These flight simulators are used in research to understand and improve managerial decision making in complex dynamic systems; more importantly, they are now widely used by corporations and universities around the world for teaching, problem solving, and policy design. Professor Sterman discovered system dynamics modeling in high school, studied it as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College, and received his PhD from MIT. He has been awarded the Jay W. Forrester Prize, given for the best published work in the field of system dynamics over the prior five years, and has four times won awards for teaching excellence from the students of the Sloan School."

Spencer Standish Professor of Management at the Sloan School of Management of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Director of MITâ€™s System Dynamics Group. His research centers on the development of practical methods for systems thinking and dynamic modeling of complex systems, with applications to organizational learning and change, operations management, corporate strategy, and nonlinear dynamics in a wide range of systems, from supply chains to scientific revolutions. He has pioneered the development of **management flight simulators** of corporate and economic systems. These **flight simulators** are used in research to understand and improve managerial decision making in complex dynamic systems; more importantly, they are now widely used by corporations and universities around the world for teaching, problem solving, and policy design. Professor Sterman discovered system dynamics modeling in high school, studied it as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College, and received his PhD from MIT. He has been awarded the Jay W. Forrester Prize, given for the best published work in the field of system dynamics over the prior five years, and has four times won awards for teaching excellence from the students of the Sloan School."

From the viewpoint of simplification, this equation says more implicitly than explicitly. Why? Because it states that no other equation is needed. It says, for instance, that the force of attraction between two bodies is in no way dependent on the presence of a third body, so that only pairs of bodies need be considered in turn, and then all of their effects may be added up (Figure 1.3)."
