      "text": "The study tour to British Columbia to learn more about NOII delivered a big 'ah ha' moment for me. I wondered how, in fact I was perplexed that, two similarly complex jurisdictions be producing such different outcomes? And further discoveries during the study tour drove me further into that discomfort of not knowing. School budgets were considerably tighter in British Columbia, especially in relation to professional learning. The technology in classroom fell short of the Queensland experience and student data hardly got a mention."

They did used data and certainly reviewed their practice but this was done because it was part of learning, not because they were told to do it. This is what Daniel Pink says motivates people undertaking complex jobs: Purpose, Mastery and Autonomy."
