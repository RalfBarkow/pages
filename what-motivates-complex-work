      "text": "The study tour to British Columbia to learn more about NOII delivered a big 'ah ha' moment for me. I wondered how, in fact, I was perplexed that, two similarly complex jurisdictions be producing such different outcomes. And further discoveries during the study tour drove me further into that discomfort of not knowing. School budgets were considerably tighter in British Columbia, especially in relation to professional learning. The technology in classrooms fell short of the Queensland experience and student data hardly got a mention."

The Networks of Inquiry and Innovation were self-organizing, independent and unfunded groups of educators across British Columbia. They had a clear moral purpose â€“ three audacious goals."

In other words, not underpinned by the mechanistic models of a [[Cartesian Mindset]], based on a [[Eurocentric Worldview]], that other education systems, including my own, were focused on. They were, instead, organically self-organising, without hierarchy and members were focused on making a personal difference for students."

They did use data and certainly reviewed their practice but this was done because it was part of learning, not because they were told to do it. This is what Daniel Pink says motivates people undertaking complex jobs: Purpose, Mastery and Autonomy."
