Tech debt is frequently experienced by developers not only as a difficult source of friction in their day-to-day technical decision-making, but also as a source of ambiguity about what types of engineering work their organizations value (Besker et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2023). When people experience disparate and conflicting signals about what others expect of them, this often results in role ambiguity (Jackson & Schuler, 1985). Developer experience initiatives could consider how leadership can reduce role ambiguity and affirm the visibility of engineering work, as a key strategic element in a tech debt initiative. (p. 8)"
