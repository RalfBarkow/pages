        "text": "[…] *distinctions* are characterized by having a limiting boundary. They represent the act of reifying the existence of, or maybe thinking about, an object. More precisely, a distinction is the consequence of separating something from its environment. The distinction’s boundary has the quality of being unambiguous. It sorts all locations in the universe into two sets: the inside, and the outside. Generally speaking, you can think of a distinction as a circle drawn on a piece of paper. As you can see, the circumference unambiguously sorts all locations of the plane into two regions: the inside of the circumference, and the plane with the circle carved off from it. Thus, the circle itself and the rest are now distinct places separated by the circumference. In three dimensions, we typically think of the book, the chair, the coffee cup, and many other things. When we listen to music, properly tempered tones are associated to a well defined range of frequencies. When we think of time using a wrist watch, we easily draw distinctions in terms of before and after. In general, we construct our experience of the world in terms of distinctions. As far as we are concerned, all the objects we distinguish have precisely defined boundaries."
