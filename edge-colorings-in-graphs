The Locating Chromatic Number of the Join of Graphs.. Online. 21 January 2012. arXiv. arXiv:1112.2357. Available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2357 [Accessed 10 January 2024]. \nLet $f$ be a proper $k$-coloring of a connected graph $G$ and $Pi=(V_1,V_2,...,V_k)$ be an ordered partition of $V(G)$ into the resulting color classes. For a vertex $v$ of $G$, the color code of $v$ with respect to $Pi$ is defined to be the ordered $k$-tuple $c_{{}_Pi}(v):=(d(v,V_1),d(v,V_2),...,d(v,V_k)),$ where $d(v,V_i)=min{d(v,x)|xin V_i}, 1leq ileq k$. If distinct vertices have distinct color codes, then $f$ is called a locating coloring. The minimum number of colors needed in a locating coloring of $G$ is the locating chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $Cchi_{{}_L}(G)$. In this paper, we study the locating chromatic number of the join of graphs. We show that when $G_1$ and $G_2$ are two connected graphs with diameter at most two, then $Cchi_{{}_L}(G_1+G_2)=Cchi_{{}_L}(G_1)+Cchi_{{}_L}(G_2)$, where $G_1+G_2$ is the join of $G_1$ and $G_2$. Also, we determine the locating chromatic numbers of the join of paths, cycles and complete multipartite graphs.\narXiv:1112.2357 [math]\n\nBEHTOEI, Ali and OMOOMI, Behnaz, 2011.

Since hypergraph colorability is NP-hard, we cannot directly express in a propositional formula that we want only non-colorable hypergraphs. Instead, we use one SAT (SMS) solver to generate candidate hypergraphs modulo isomorphisms, and another to reject them by finding a coloring. Each successive candidate is required to defeat all previous colorings, whereby we avoid having to generate and test all linear hypergraphs. \nComputational methods have previously been used to verify the EFL conjecture for small hypergraphs. We verify and extend these results to larger values and discuss challenges and directions. Ours is the first computational approach to the EFL conjecture that allows producing independently verifiable, DRAT proofs."

A SAT Solver’s Opinion on the Erdős-Faber-Lovász Conjecture. . Online. 2023. P. 17 pages, 788511 bytes. DOI 10.4230/LIPICS.SAT.2023.13. [Accessed 10 January 2024]. \nIn 1972, Paul Erdős, Vance Faber, and Lászlo Lovász asked whether every linear hypergraph with n vertices can be edge-colored with n colors, a statement that has come to be known as the EFL conjecture. Erdős himself considered the conjecture as one of his three favorite open problems, and offered increasing money prizes for its solution on several occasions. A proof of the conjecture was recently announced, for all but a finite number of hypergraphs. In this paper we look at some of the cases not covered by this proof. \nWe use SAT solvers, and in particular the SAT Modulo Symmetries (SMS) framework, to generate non-colorable linear hypergraphs with a fixed number of vertices and hyperedges modulo isomorphisms. Since hypergraph colorability is NP-hard, we cannot directly express in a propositional formula that we want only non-colorable hypergraphs. Instead, we use one SAT (SMS) solver to generate candidate hypergraphs modulo isomorphisms, and another to reject them by finding a coloring. Each successive candidate is required to defeat all previous colorings, whereby we avoid having to generate and test all linear hypergraphs. \nComputational methods have previously been used to verify the EFL conjecture for small hypergraphs. We verify and extend these results to larger values and discuss challenges and directions. Ours is the first computational approach to the EFL conjecture that allows producing independently verifiable, DRAT proofs."
