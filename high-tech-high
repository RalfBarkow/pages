Faced with a shortage of workers for the locally strong high tech and biotech industries, the group wondered why the local school system was not better able to produce more qualified workers. Having given money to the school district in the past and questioning the return on that investment, these local entrepreneurs decided to open a new high school and christened it High Tech High.\n>\nSoon thereafter, longtime educator Larry Rosenstock was asked to present to this group about different possible governance structures for the school.
