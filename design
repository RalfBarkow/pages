In my youth, I shepherded groups on night walks in the tropical rainforests of North Queensland. Turning our torches off, and hearing the exclamations of wonder and awe as eyes adjusted and the luminescent fungi dominated the forest floor are vivid memories. This is also the joy I felt when a student experienced a learning breakthrough, or mastery over a process. Or when a sports team I had coached celebrated an applied, newly acquired skill in a game setting."

Using feedback reversibility as a guiding principle, we devise a method for [[design]]ing optimal feedback protocols for thermodynamic engines that extracts all the information gained during feedback as work. Our method is based on the observation that in a feedback-reversible process the measurement and the time-reversal of the ensuing protocol both prepare the system in the same probabilistic state. We illustrate the utility of our method with two examples of the multi-particle Szilard engine.\n"

In my youth, I shepherded groups on night walks in the tropical rainforests of North Queensland. Turning our torches off, and hearing the exclamations of wonder and awe as eyes adjusted and the luminescent fungi dominated the forest floor are vivid memories. This is also the joy I felt when a student experienced a learning breakthrough, or mastery over a process. Or when a sports team I had coached celebrated an applied, newly acquired skill in a game setting."
