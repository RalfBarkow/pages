Specifically, he explores the idea of preemptive action as a strategic move that organizations can make to maintain their autonomy and prevent potential disturbances to their operations.\n\nAccording to Luhmann, preemptive advantage refers to the ability of an organization to take action before an external event occurs that might affect the organization negatively. This allows the organization to maintain its autonomy and avoid having to respond reactively to external forces.\n\nLuhmann argues that preemptive advantage is particularly important in complex societies where the actions of other organizations and actors can have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences. By taking preemptive action, organizations can maintain control over their operations and avoid being subject to the whims of external forces.\n\nOverall, Luhmann sees preemptive advantage as a key concept in understanding how organizations maintain their autonomy and navigate the complexities of modern society."

On the other hand, in the opposite direction of view, the problem of system/environment difference can be clarified with the help of the concept of complexity. The establishment and maintenance of a system/environment difference becomes a problem because the environment for each system is more complex than the system itself. "

The reader enters a complex self-supporting system of distinctions and partial theories without being subjected to a linear form of presentation that, following the model of an educational process, terminates in a final insight that allows the reader to catch up with the author. On the other hand, the architecture of the system opens up only through basic ideas that are successively unfolded."

At this level of a theory of functional differentiation, work-systematically, are Luhmann's major studies of the science, economy, law, or art of society. The GG concentrates on reconstructing the general trend towards the emergence of this form of differentiation. According to the dominant type of evolutionary differentiation, social communication generates different forms of unit concepts. Such unit concepts crystallize in the form of semantics. "

In his studies on \"Social Structure and Semantics\" Luhmann has already traced these connections under manifold aspects (GS). At this point, the systems theory of society offers itself as an adequate form of reflection, in order to provide the differentiated nature of social communication with a descriptive model, which, without claiming ultimate justification, makes the conditions and consequences of the achieved degree of communicative improbability transparent. It describes the whole as a differentiated without a center, whose coherence only becomes visible in the polycentric form of system theory. The unity in the multiplicity itself has \"no address\" (GG, 866)."

Specifically, he explores the idea of preemptive action as a strategic move that organizations can make to maintain their autonomy and prevent potential disturbances to their operations.\n\nAccording to Luhmann, preemptive advantage refers to the ability of an organization to take action before an external event occurs that might affect the organization negatively. This allows the organization to maintain its autonomy and avoid having to respond reactively to external forces.\n\nLuhmann argues that preemptive advantage is particularly important in complex societies where the actions of other organizations and actors can have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences. By taking preemptive action, organizations can maintain control over their operations and avoid being subject to the whims of external forces.\n\nOverall, Luhmann sees preemptive advantage as a key concept in understanding how organizations maintain their autonomy and navigate the complexities of modern society."

        "text": "Niklas Luhmann discusses the concept of preemptive advantage in his book \"[[Social Systems]]\" (1984). Specifically, he explores the idea of preemptive action as a strategic move that organizations can make to maintain their autonomy and prevent potential disturbances to their operations.\n\nAccording to Luhmann, preemptive advantage refers to the ability of an organization to take action before an external event occurs that might affect the organization negatively. This allows the organization to maintain its autonomy and avoid having to respond reactively to external forces.\n\nLuhmann argues that preemptive advantage is particularly important in complex societies where the actions of other organizations and actors can have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences. By taking preemptive action, organizations can maintain control over their operations and avoid being subject to the whims of external forces.\n\nOverall, Luhmann sees preemptive advantage as a key concept in understanding how organizations maintain their autonomy and navigate the complexities of modern society."
