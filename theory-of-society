Universality of subject matter in the sense that, as a sociological theory, it deals with everything social and not just sub-areas (such as stratification and mobility, features of modern society, patterns of interaction, etc.).\n"

This is consequential for a systems-theoretical conception of the media, which grasps mass media as a \"condition of the possibility of modern society\" (Luhmann 1997, p. 883 f.) and thus at the same time counts among the conditions of possibility of the systems theory of society.\n"

Luhmann 2017, p. 883) belong to the preconditions of society that sociology describes, the relations are also to be 'thought circularly' in this case.\n"

      "text": "Having said this much about Luhmann's sociology of systems, one can expect that *Die Realität der Massenmedien* (The Reality of Mass Media) also follows the theoretical structure of the main works and treats mass media as an object which, firstly, belongs 'to the social' and which, secondly, has a circular relationship with its sociological description. One is not disappointed: \"Inevitably, any description of our society must include these means (and to that extent: its own means) and their relation to itself,\" Luhmann (1997, p. 1097). Mass media thus only become an object of sociology at all insofar as they belong to the object area as something social - in Luhmann's case, therefore, as an \"institution of society\" that \"make[s] use of technical means of reproduction for the dissemination of communication\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 10), so that \"no interaction among those present can take place between sender and receiver,\" and because of this technically conditioned \"interruption of direct contact,\" the mass media's \"readiness to broadcast and interest in broadcasting [...] cannot be centrally coordinated\" (Luhmann 1997, p. 11 f.). The mass media communicate information that is understood however by the one who \"sees, hears, reads\" (Luhmann 1997, p. 14). They offer - without being able to precisely determine the \"currently participating circle of addressees\" (Luhmann 1997, p. 14) \"in contrast to an interaction among those present\" - selection offers of which they can only assume that they will also be accepted. The mass media therefore make do with \"assumptions about reasonableness and acceptance\" (1997, p. 12), but the readers, listeners, and viewers also form expectations about which offer they can expect when and from which medium. \"Accordingly, the knowledge conveyed by the mass media slides over minds without looking inside them. It creates no certainty about what individuals now really mean or prefer\" (Luhmann 2017, p. 893). The technical separation of senders and receivers nonetheless enables a buildup of expectations and expectations of expectations on both sides (i.e., ego's expectation of what alter expects ego to expect). Luhmann has found the beautiful image of a mirror for this, where the back is also mirrored: \n"

And also an observer, who would come to it, would also see himself in this mirror, as he observes others to observe himself in the mirror. Here, too, the relations are to be 'thought circularly'. And just as society produces a sociology that describes a society that conceives a sociology of society, which can then be called The Society of Society, so the title The Reality of Mass Media can be understood as indicating that the reality of mass media is a reality produced in our society, a reality produced in society and by the social operations of society itself - a reality that is no more and no less than an 'internal correlate of system operations (Luhmann 1996, p. 19). In principle, this applies to any system that is able to distinguish self-reference from external reference and form assumptions about itself and its environment. Insofar as mass media are part of the \"condition of the possibility of modern society\" (Luhmann 2017, p. 883 f.), however, the particular question arises here to what extent the reality of society must be understood as the reality of mass media in the sense of \"what appears as reality for them or through them for others\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 14, orig. cit.).\n"

Precht is right about this. According to Luhmann, the mass media \"distortion of communication\" (1971b, p. 121; cf. Habermas 1990, p. 28) feared and criticized by Jürgen Habermas, for instance, to cite the most prominent example, is not a problem at all, because there is only \"little point in asking whether and how the mass media reproduce an existing reality in a distorted way; they produce a description of reality, a construction of the world, and that is the reality on which society orients itself\" (Luhmann 1997, p. 1102). \"Distortion of communication\"? Spare me. The good question \"is not: How do the mass media distort reality by the way they present it?\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 20). You can't dump one of your most famous and renowned colleagues any cooler than that; Luhmann's italics make the point even more special.\n"

If one now tried to reassure oneself by saying that this is probably \"only\" true for society, which has always been described \"subjectively\" in this or another way, but not for nature, whose reality is not constructed, but really is the way it is, then one is immediately disappointed; an imposition for all those who believe that they have to \"separate between the pure social force and the pure natural mechanism [...]\" (Latour 1998, p. 44): \"This applies not only to our knowledge of society and history, but also to our knowledge of nature. What we know about the stratosphere is like what Plato knows about Atlantis: one has heard about it\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 9).\n"

      "text": "This was so provocative and at the same time so stimulating in the early 1990s that it \"immediately made the rounds\" in the relevant theoretical circles (Weischenberg 2014, p. 343). And again, this presupposes mass media and their \"popularization\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 20), which in turn implies that Luhmann's contribution is also suitable as a mass media topic, which depends less on scientific criteria one might apply to a systems sociology paper to judge its plausibility and assess its value to the field, but mainly on, whether, in the case of this small but rather complicated and idiosyncratically formulated booklet - one of hundreds of thousands of books published in 1996, and one of an incalculable number of sociological publications - the agencies of the mass media reckon with \"Einschaltinteresse\" and therefore show a \"readiness to broadcast\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 12). This has been the case. The media reported. Nikolaus von Festenberg begins his review (Der Spiegel, 7.10.1996) thus: \"Plain, apodictic and hammer-hard it stands there, the first sentence of Niklas Luhmann's new book, which will revolutionize the discussion about the influence of press and television: 'What we know about our society, indeed about the world in which we live, we know through the mass media'\". What one needs to know about Luhmann is also known from the mass media. And also the sociologist must look into the non-transparent mirror and pay attention to who else is coming into view next to him and who is possibly observing how he is being observed. It depends on \"being currently informed\" (Luhmann 1996, p. 120): \"whoever, as a researcher, is not ahead of others in his sensitivity to problems, will constantly remain in second place, analyzing afterwards what others have thought and written\" (Luhmann 2017, p. 890). \n"

However, the publishing house does not seem to have reckoned with the mass media's interest in their sociological observations and the successful popularization of their writings. Precht states (Die Zeit, 22.11.1996): \"The new work *Die Realität der Massenmedien* is a sales success; so unusual, for a complicated theory book, that the publisher was not prepared for it at all at first\". The sales success could be based on the fact that already the first sentence is first of all quotable (so far almost everybody reads) and for many scientific texts (so far, as said, there are at least several thousand), which have to document the knowledge of the state of research or also readership, this quotation is already sufficient, and secondly also for the non-sociologist a useful party piece represents, whose clou then lies in rejecting theses about the manipulation of reality by the media sovereignly with the assertion that media produce this reality.

In any case, the popular \"dictum\" in question refers to the mass-media condensate of a sociological treatise and thus to what can be presupposed as a background reality \"from which one can assume\" for others as well (Luhmann 1996, p. 120). However, the author's bon mot about Plato and Atlantis also applies to Luhmann's systems theory: \"One has heard of it\" (Luhmann 1997, p. 9). And, as Luhmann himself points out (1997, p. 9), this also applies to the sciences. Furthermore, one of the functions of this background reality is that one can \"stand out from it\" oneself, if it seems \"conducive\", in order to distinguish oneself with dissenting opinions (Luhmann 1997, p. 120) - today, for example, with the pseudo-constructivist claim that fake news is basically expectable, since media never reflect reality anyway, but construct it, so that the expectation of a media reproduction of facts is a naïve illusion. The fact that the socially relevant reality for us is constructed and that almost everything we know about this reality is communicated by mass media and therefore also follows the rules of mass media communication does not mean for Luhmann that statements about reality are arbitrary, that fakes and facts represent arbitrary attributions for arbitrary news.\n"

In any case, the popular \"dictum\" in question refers to the mass-media condensate of a sociological treatise and thus to what can be presupposed as a background reality \"from which one can assume\" for others as well (Luhmann 1996, p. 120). However, the author's bon mot about Plato and Atlantis also applies to Luhmann's systems theory: \"One has heard of it\" (Luhmann 1997, p. 9). And, as Luhmann himself points out (1997, p. 9), this also applies to the sciences. Furthermore, one of the functions of this background reality is that one can \"stand out from it\" oneself, if it seems \"conducive\", in order to distinguish oneself with dissenting opinions (Luhmann 1997, p. 120) - today, for example, with the pseudo-constructivist claim that fake news is basically expectable, since media never reflect reality anyway, but construct it, so that the expectation of a media reproduction of facts is a naïve illusion. The fact that the socially relevant reality for us is constructed and that almost everything we know about this reality is communicated by mass media and therefore also follows the rules of mass media communication does not mean for Luhmann that statements about reality are arbitrary, that fakes and facts represent arbitrary attributions for arbitrary news."
