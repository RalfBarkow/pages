Nevertheless, control software engineering still tends to be the last step within the development process. To a large extent it is carried out during the commissioning phase of the production ramp-up. On the first hand this leads to a loss of time and quality as well as to a loss of reputation and future orders on the second hand. A method that is referred to as Virtual Commissioning tries to overcome this situation. The aim is to enable control software engineering to, both take over the initiative in system design and to perform important activities earlier in the design process of production equipment. In this paper, the technological and economical scalability of Virtual Commissioning is analyzed. Based on the analysis, a technical concept for a scalable simulation environment is presented.

      "text": "> Automated systems are large, complex, and expensive systems; therefore, it is often a better option to use virtual models of these systems for educational purposes. This project focuses on the definition and evaluation of an educational framework for virtual commissioning. The framework itself consists of a group of different software and environments interconnected between them. This is done by following the design and creation method. Acting in accordance with the methodology, the project starts with a clear identification of the need for a framework and follows an iterative process until getting a valid result. For this, first, it has been needed to select the appropriate software for the framework. Then this tentative framework definition is evaluated. Once the integration is valid, the framework itself is used to conduct the virtual commissioning of a manufacturing process that produces two different product variants. This is done to evaluate the framework in terms of virtual commissioning. The result is a framework fully integrated, being able to exchange different data types through the different environments. The final implementation design consists of three different environments that allow PLC and HMI programming, 3D modelling and robot programming, and connection to the cloud via an API and the implementation of a smart algorithm for the optimization of the makespan of a client order. The resulting framework is also one that allows the user to experience different activities that are performed when performing virtual commissioning, such as the PLC and robot programming and other IT solutions like the implementation of APIs and smart algorithms."

      "text": "VC is a tool that serves to test manufacturing systems and their control programs through simulation on a virtual plant before the actual commissioning of the physical plant is realized (Hoffmann et al., 2010). In industry, the commissioning part usually takes 25% of the total time of the project. Moreover, 60% of that commissioning time is spent debugging the control software (Reinhart & Wünsch, 2007). Even if VC has been around for about two decades now, it is still not widely used in the industry. This is partly due to the lack of competencies and experience when integrating such virtual systems (Makris et al., 2012; Wöhlke & Schiller, 2005). That is why it is important to get an educational framework to train both the academic and industrial stakeholders on virtual commissioning."

        "text": "> Automated systems are large, complex, and expensive systems; therefore, it is often a better option to use virtual models of these systems for educational purposes. This project focuses on the definition and evaluation of an educational framework for virtual commissioning. The framework itself consists of a group of different software and environments interconnected between them. This is done by following the design and creation method. Acting in accordance with the methodology, the project starts with a clear identification of the need for a framework and follows an iterative process until getting a valid result. For this, first, it has been needed to select the appropriate software for the framework. Then this tentative framework definition is evaluated. Once the integration is valid, the framework itself is used to conduct the virtual commissioning of a manufacturing process that produces two different product variants. This is done to evaluate the framework in terms of virtual commissioning. The result is a framework fully integrated, being able to exchange different data types through the different environments. The final implementation design consists of three different environments that allow PLC and HMI programming, 3D modelling and robot programming, and connection to the cloud via an API and the implementation of a smart algorithm for the optimization of the makespan of a client order. The resulting framework is also one that allows the user to experience different activities that are performed when performing virtual commissioning, such as the PLC and robot programming and other IT solutions like the implementation of APIs and smart algorithms."
