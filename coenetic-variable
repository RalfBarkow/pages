        "text": "Coenetic variables are those varying factors which are common to a system and its environment and affect both. Very often they are not recognized as such, because the boundaries of the system are drawn so as to exclude them. Through directive correlation, coenetic variables act to reduce the variety operating between a system and its environment and narrow the field in which adaptation occurs. The action of coenetic variables is one of the reasons that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish, or fix over time, the boundaries between systems and their environments.\nThe same set of coenetic variables can have very different effects on different parts of the environment. A snowstorm, for example, will be greeted as a boon to winter resort operators and a disaster to a shopkeeper who stocks highly perishable or date-specific goods.\n# SOURCE\nSommerhoff, G. (1950). Analytical Biology. London: Oxford University Press.\nSommerhoff, G. (1974). Logic of the living brain. London: Wiley.\nThe word coenetic (pronounced sennetic) was coined by Sommerhoff from the Greek word meaning 'common'.\n# EXAMPLES\n• the effect of change in interest rates on the build-up of inventory and the terms offered to retailers\n• the amount of rainfall on the harvest date and yield\n• the change in traffic patterns resulting from the temporary closing of a major artery\n• the impact of economic conditions on business investment\n# NON-EXAMPLES\n• the behavior of a supervisor towards a subordinate"
