His work has always been focused on organizational learning and toward the whole community served by health-care organizations.\n\nHe led in creating a countywide integrated delivery system, and in developing community-wide, patient-centered technologies, including an electronic medical record system, secure whole-county health Intranet, electronic personal-health records and a electronic personalized-care-management system.  CMG clients seek his advice as they redesign care and realign clinicians to manage population health. \n\nDr. Pierson led the Whatcom County’s Pursuing Perfection project for five years, with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and oversight by health-care reformer Don Berwick and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI).  As a direct outcome of that learning Marc recruited Nik Ivancic to Whatcom County and they worked with various institutions and individuals to create the Shared Care Plan, a groundbreaking, patient-centered personal- health-record system. The Shared Care Plan was an inspiration for Washington State’s Health Record Bank project and influenced Microsoft’s development of HealthVault.\n\nHis main career interest remains designing and implementing organizational and technical support for people in communities so that residents and patients can better care for themselves in collaborative and convenient ways.   Dr. Pierson believes that this is essential for community health and for the success of accountable-care programs.\n\nMarc Pierson has been a board-certified emergency physician and internist. He trained at Indiana University Medical School and completed a residency in internal medicine at Parkland Memorial Hospital, in Dallas, Texas.\n\n"
