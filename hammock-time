It brings together ancient ways and wisdom with cutting edge environmental health science. Simply put, forest bathing is the practice of walking slowly through the woods, in no hurry, for a morning, an afternoon or a day. It is a practice that involves all the senses and as you gently walk and breathe deeply, the essential oils of the trees are absorbed by your body and have an extraordinary effect on positive feelings, stress hormone levels, parasympathetic nervous activity, sympathetic nervous activity, blood pressure, heart rate and brain activity. In this wonderful book, by the leading expert in the field, science meets nature, as we are encouraged to bathe in the trees and become observers of both the environment around us and the goings on of our own minds.‚Äù"

However, it demonstrates how even a small, seemingly casual bit of dialogue may be revealing. Father and son have the solar ship under control and are relaxing. Jake is tired and says he wants to sleep. Benjamin points toward the ship‚Äôs bedroom: an alcove and a woven rope hammock. Jake jokes by playfully calling out, ‚ÄòYo‚Äô, and Benjamin answers back, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs hammock time‚Äô. It is an easy, light mood between the Siskos. But mood alone cannot explain these dialogue choices. Associating the Siskos with these words like ‚ÄòYo!‚Äô and ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs hammock time!‚Äô links these fictional, future African Americans with real, contemporary African American popular culture and cultural production (specifically, hip-hop culture). These expressions are more evidence that the producers and actors in this episode are creating a very different kind of space for cultural representation here. It is a space that is not only outside of Starfleet/Federation, but also outside of time as well. These creative choices give these African American characters freedoms of action and expression that are not usually allowed within the highly structured regime of Starfleet/Federation protocols."
