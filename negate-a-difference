That type of mapping is even difficult to write in conventional notation. Function notation also obeys the structural restrictions of containers. But we could read ([A)] as a Venn diagram, for instance, where the round- and square- boundaries each identify a set, and A identifies the intersection of both sets. The two overlapping functions become two different properties shared by the single object A."
