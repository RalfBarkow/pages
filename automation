Joint activity is defined as an extended set of actions that are carried out by an ensemble of people coordinating with each other. To carry out joint activity, each party effectively enters into a Basic Compact, an agreement to facilitate coordination, work toward shared goals, and prevent breakdowns in team coordination. Effective coordination requires establishing and maintaining common ground and an intelligent agent must fulfil the requirements of a Basic Compact to engage in common-grounding activities.
