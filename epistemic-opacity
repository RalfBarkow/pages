        "text": "In a recent dispute over the philosophical novelty of computer simulations, Humphreys (2009) argued in favor of four genuine philosophical issues that require the attention of philosophers, namely, *epistemic opacity*, the *semantics* of computer simulations, the temporal dynamics of computational processes and the distinction in principle/in practice. Of those four issues, this article focuses solely on epistemic opacity, arguably the most controversial issue raised by Humphreys."
