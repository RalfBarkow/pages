The thing about Nuno Oliveira was that he rode with a definite contact even though it was very light…, I believe that to teach this it is necessary to first get the rider to have a normal contact going with the movement of the horse’s mouth. To start with a lighter contact than this is more difficult for most riders. This type of contact is also only possible with an ability to use very small aids and with a horse that is between the aids and through the back.

If this can be achieved with just the \"weight of the reins\" as contact then it's OK. The horse is then \"to \" the contact. It is difficult though to indicate to the horse to go more outward (stretch) and forward with this flimsy contact, so one is left with judging and commenting on the result, that the horse is seen to be off/behind the contact when asked to lengthen. It is often used as an excuse for having the horse off and behind the contact. You and the horse need to clearly understand the two concepts of holding position when the contact is yielded, and taking the rein forward (and down), and the horse to be able to do either on request and without locking his back. “",

The thing about Nuno Oliveira was that he rode with a definite contact even though it was very light…, I believe that to teach this it is necessary to first get the rider to have a normal contact going with the movement of the horse’s mouth. To start with a lighter contact than this is more difficult for most riders. This type of contact is also only possible with an ability to use very small aids and with a horse that is between the aids and through the back.

Many riders simply see this as an exercise in shortening the reins (hauling in the front end). This always causes a “fight” as the horse feels the restriction in front. Instead the rider must bring the horse’s head up first with her seat. This creates a loop in the rein which the rider can then remove by shortening her reins. The action in the seat goes from passive (following) to controlling (restricting)…but for this to work the rider must have a seat capable of making this adjustment.",
