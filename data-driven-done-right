      "text": "so this the entirety of this talk is about my time at Etsy I don't work there anymore but I had a great time there and I learned a lot and I'm not done talking about it I'll tell you just a little bit about what Etsy is it's a marketplace for handmade and vintage goods it's sold well over a billion dollars of stuff in 2013 probably more this year so Etsy's really big but when I got my start there it was really small it was less than 20 people when I started and that journey from point A to point B was a really wild ride it there was a lot of arguing about a lot of stuff there were three CEO changes while I was there the thing we argued about the most was this what do we spend our time on so at all points what we told ourselves about that was this we should try to be data-driven now somebody had heard that Google was data-driven we really wanted to be like Google and so we said okay we're gonna be data-driven too and there was one problem with that which is that nobody had any idea what that meant or what that would imply so what you would get all the time was something like this somebody would have a project that they wanted to get scheduled and they would sprinkle some numbers on it and call it data-driven it was like this weird display behavior but over time I did start to figure out what it would mean to actually choose what we work on using data and I also realized that it was not that difficult and that's what the rest of this talk is about so I want to talk you through how I figured all that stuff out and that starts back in 2007 I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea here and think that I'm talking smack about Etsy in its early days I'm definitely not it was a magical place it was awesome and I missed 2007 all the time but I also think it's really important to be honest about it and the truth of the matter is that Etsy didn't grow geometrically because of the carefully planned and executed activities of its employees it grew geometrically because it was like striking oil bets he was this thing that was out there waiting for somebody to discover it but just as human beings were not really hardwired to see things that way we tend to think that if you do something and it's a big success then the things that you did before it was successful must have caused that success that's just human nature and we took that into the product as well we thought well we built this thing and people really loved it and so that's just a repeatable process and we didn't really question ourselves too much we thought well if you build it they will come and the crazy thing about that is that if growth is really this big externality then no matter what you do it looks like it's working as long as you don't completely destroy the core functionality of the site you can do literally anything you want and all the grafts go up into the right and that was the situation we found ourselves in and it was great but it's only great as long as you don't think about it too hard and so of course we ruined all of it by going and thinking about it too hard I was there long enough to notice that we went through this cycle over and over again so we would release a product we would have an all-hands meeting where we'd say hey we released this thing and everybody would applaud and scream and be happy about it and then you wouldn't hear much about it for a while and then two years later we'd turn it off because nobody ever used it we did that over and over again a good example of that is this product called alchemy the general idea there was that you could come to Etsy describe an item that you wanted to buy and then Etsy sellers could bid on making it for you and that is a really cool idea it got written up in the New York Times a couple of times it was generally perceived to be great but by 2011 we just turned it off and it's entire three-year lifetime alchemy sold fewer items then fewer items than the Etsy the rest of the site sells over the course of a day so it was a huge bust then around this time I had had enough of this and I thought I was very selfishly hey is there any way I personally could avoid participating in projects like this because I have this weird thing about me where I'd like to just completely waste my time doing things like that around the same time we started a/b testing stuff and I kind of latched on to that as a solution maybe so the idea there would be instead of just pushing something out to all of traffic and then praying what we would do instead would be push something out and only give it to half of people and then make some sort of objective measurement about whether or not they were behaving the way we wanted them to and the thing we discovered almost immediately upon doing that is oh my god we're nowhere near as good at our jobs as we thought that we were what happened most of the time was that we would push a project put push something out a B test it and nothing would happen it was just crickets there would be no no reaction whatsoever no metrics would move what happened occasionally would be that things got worse usually only slightly worse but nevertheless worse the thing that never happened was that we would release something and then and there'd be this major improvement in any metrics that we cared about the problem at the time I think was that we were still picking products based on what sounds the best but a critical thing had changed my slide screwed up a critical thing had changed but and that was that we had added this objective measurement of how well we were doing and so I think at that point it would have been a popular decision to stop measuring but that would have been very disingenuous right we'd opened up Pandora's box by seeing how good we were doing and we couldn't just like close it again and say well the hell with it but over time like we did figure out ways to improve our batting average and I'm gonna talk through that now so to recap in the very beginning we'd come up with an idea spend a ton of time building it and then we'd push it out a little later we added this a be testing step to it although most of the time the a/b testing step took a lot longer than we intended it to take because we weren't getting the results we wanted to get sometimes we never got the result that we wanted to get and we would just have to throw out everything we were doing and that sucked that hurt a lot but by about 2012 we settled into a process that looked a lot more like this and it's a little more complicated but there a good reason for it the core idea there is that instead of just like coming up with an idea and then off to the races go build it you use data to try and figure out first if you can how good of an idea it is another critical part of it is that you don't over invest in the building step because experience tells us most things don't work out the way you initially conceived them UAB tests a minimal version of it first and then you go back later you refine it and then you do subsequent a B tests to get to some point where you are comfortable releasing something to all traffic great thing about this process is that it gives you at least two places early on where you can just give up those are much cheaper than doing it at the very end you still retain the option of giving up at the very end of the process but you don't have to exercise it that often if you give yourself more chances so rather than just leave you with that abstraction I'm going to go through two examples these are both products that we at least talked about building at Etsy at some point and I think that the notable thing about these is that neither of them sounds completely crazy the first time you hear it here it said so the first one is let's build a landing page for local furniture so that slide is screwed up again anyway the the idea here is Etsy has these landing pages for all of its categories it has one for furniture too the thing that's notable about furniture is furniture is really heavy and that makes it really hard to sell on the Internet so the idea here would be let's only show people furniture that's close to them geographically and then maybe they'll buy more of it that sounds like a reasonable idea the first thing I would do there would be to say okay who's gonna see this thing in this case it turns out a lot of people would see it so the pages we're talking about changing aren't the most important pages on Etsy by any means but they're in the top five which in the context of Etsy is a whole lot of traffic obviously not all that's for furniture but a good bit of it is for furniture so so far so good now if you dig a little bit deeper what you find is that unfortunately not very many people buy items that they find on these pages if you compare it to a page like search search has a ton of traffic and many many people find products that they wind up buying using search but not very many people find products they wind up buying using these pages so that makes this look a little bit worse now hold on a minute though furniture like I said it's very heavy it's also very expensive so maybe although we're not going to sell many more pieces of furniture the ones we do sell will be worth a lot so maybe it may still make sense to do this we'll make it up that way so if you imagine that the average item on Etsy is worth about $40 and it's not like I have to fake a bunch of financial numbers here it's not $40 but let's imagine that it is let's say that the average item of furniture that we're going to sell will be 10 times that it's going to be $400 and so from here we have enough inputs where we can start to reason about what it would mean to for us to improve the state of the world by changing this page that's an equation that looks like this we have a certain number of visits to the these pages they convert into purchases at some rate the each one of those purchases is worth some amount and then we're going to improve that by some percentage I talked through how we estimate the first three terms there and now we're gonna see what different values for how much we're gonna change things would affect the world so that's what this looks like over the course of a year this would this is what it would mean to improve purchasing behavior by half a percent through two percent I chose those percentages based mostly on past experience with doing a/b tests on these kinds of pages usually you don't affect people's behavior all that much I think that change in two percent would be really hitting it out of the park but let's say that we really do hit it out of the park and we change people we make people 2 percent more likely to buy what that would mean would be that so you would sell three hundred and sixty thousand dollars more stuff more furniture over the course of a year a critical piece of context there though is that Etsy is a marketplace so most of the value goes to the people selling the items of furniture Etsy only keeps three and a half percent of the sale price so that's thirteen thousand dollars now if you imagine that a to developers a product manager a designer all of their HR overhead all of their managerial overhead their health insurance and all of that is devoted to this for a month or two then this makes this not look very attractive you can realize that oh it's it's gonna take at sea a very long time to earn back the what they invest in this if we do this and so I would say at this point let's go work on something else whereas in the past what we would have done would would have been we would have stopped that idea and said that sounds like a pretty good idea go but go build that second idea I'm gonna go through is emailing people that give up in the middle of purchases so Etsy like every e-commerce site that exists has this shopping cart you add stuff to your cart you fill out your shipping information you fill out your credit card information and then you check out and people can and do give up at every step along the way so the idea here would be for the people who give up along the way let's wait like five days send them an email and say hey did you really intend to buy that thing because you didn't maybe you just close the tab accidentally it happens something like that and so modeling that looks like this we have a certain number of users per day who are eligible for that email they have some average value of stuff in their cart and we're gonna be successful by some percentage at getting them to come back and finish buying so if we model that in the same way it looks like this it I chose percentages of our success rate at being between one and five percent I think that a higher guess is reasonable in this case because these are much more engaged users first of all we know their email address and then second of all they're halfway down the checkout funnel already so I think that we could postulate that we're gonna be slightly more successful at getting them to come back and buy but let's be conservative here and say well we're only gonna get one percent more of them to come back and buy with this what would that mean in this case what that would mean is that Etsy would sell three million dollars more stuff or Etsy would keep a hundred thousand dollars more and so that looks a lot more attractive and I would say this is a good example of a product that we should go ahead and build and I actually did build that one while I was at Etsy and it wound up being by the time I left anyway between a half percent and 1 percent of all of Etsy sales we may not sound extremely impressive but I assure you that that's epic and so I I I hope that you can see that with just applying the most the stupidest possible math to the situation we can make one an idea look really bad and make one idea look really good when the first time you hear them they both sound like pretty good ideas"

screwed up a critical thing had changed but and that was that we had added this objective measurement of how well we were doing and so I think at that point it would have been a popular decision to stop measuring but that would have been very disingenuous right we'd opened up Pandora's box by seeing how good we were doing and we couldn't just like close it again and say well the hell with it but

the the metaphor that I have in my head when I'm doing this kind of work not to be excessively grandiose or anything as Archimedes with his lever our committee's famously said give me a place to stand and I can move the entire earth and so what you're doing when you're going through a big set of ideas and trying to apply data to them to see if they're good or not is you're searching the solution space for a place where you can stand to apply your effort to actually make a difference the questions you should be asking yourself when you're doing this is how many people do I have what are they like a important thing to note is that it's only I think it's only important to be correct within an order of magnitude that's great I think that what you'll find is if you just rely on hunches if you don't do any of this work you're not even going to be correct within an order of magnitude so closes close is good enough I think that it's still legitimate to do products just because they sound cool sometimes but the key word there is sometimes and I think how often may depend on where you are if your startup you're not going to have a lot of data to be able to do like fine grained analysis like this you may be able you may have some data you may have other people's data you can still draw a box around products and maybe your error Mart margin of error is just gonna be a lot bigger other things you can do is a start-up would be to work on tools to make doing this easier as you go along and accumulate data you can work on accumulating the data and then again if you're a very mature company you're not you will have lots of data and mature tools and a budget to do this for everything if you want but I still think it's legitimate to occasionally just take a shot at the moon once in a while so I want to leave you with a couple of thoughts so I started this I started in this journey trying to come up with a reasonable answer to what we should build and to win these arguments and I think the conclusion that I came to is that if somebody walks up to you and says I know what we should build and they can't show you any of this work you should run away from that person as fast as possible I think that a lot of ideas sound really good but I think that sounding awesome is not a remarkable feature of a product idea I think it's completely natural if you are like me an employee at a startup to think Oh CEOs doing this oh my boss is doing this in other situations you might think oh my employees are doing this for me but in my experience nobody's doing this nobody does this at all like you should ask you should you should you should do it yourself you should build tools so that everybody can do it getting access to data is kind of a tricky problem but actually doing this analysis is easy I've met tons of people in my life who just say things like they just want to build cool things or whatever and like I was like that too I just want to build cool things but I think that having an impact really having an impact is a really cool thing so thanks"

        "text": "so hey I'm Dan McKinley I'm a general-purpose web programmer guy I got my start in the financial industry over a decade ago I worked there for a while and then I freaked out and moved to Brooklyn and worked at this startup called Etsy in 2007 so this the entirety of this talk is about my time at Etsy I don't work there anymore but I had a great time there and I learned a lot and I'm not done talking about it I'll tell you just a little bit about what Etsy is it's a marketplace for handmade and vintage goods it's sold well over a billion dollars of stuff in 2013 probably more this year so Etsy's really big but when I got my start there it was really small it was less than 20 people when I started and that journey from point A to point B was a really wild ride it there was a lot of arguing about a lot of stuff there were three CEO changes while I was there the thing we argued about the most was this what do we spend our time on so at all points what we told ourselves about that was this we should try to be data-driven now somebody had heard that Google was data-driven we really wanted to be like Google and so we said okay we're gonna be data-driven too and there was one problem with that which is that nobody had any idea what that meant or what that would imply so what you would get all the time was something like this somebody would have a project that they wanted to get scheduled and they would sprinkle some numbers on it and call it data-driven it was like this weird display behavior but over time I did start to figure out what it would mean to actually choose what we work on using data and I also realized that it was not that difficult and that's what the rest of this talk is about so I want to talk you through how I figured all that stuff out and that starts back in 2007 I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea here and think that I'm talking smack about Etsy in its early days I'm definitely not it was a magical place it was awesome and I missed 2007 all the time but I also think it's really important to be honest about it and the truth of the matter is that Etsy didn't grow geometrically because of the carefully planned and executed activities of its employees it grew geometrically because it was like striking oil bets he was this thing that was out there waiting for somebody to discover it but just as human beings were not really hardwired to see things that way we tend to think that if you do something and it's a big success then the things that you did before it was successful must have caused that success that's just human nature and we took that into the product as well we thought well we built this thing and people really loved it and so that's just a repeatable process and we didn't really question ourselves too much we thought well if you build it they will come and the crazy thing about that is that if growth is really this big externality then no matter what you do it looks like it's working as long as you don't completely destroy the core functionality of the site you can do literally anything you want and all the grafts go up into the right and that was the situation we found ourselves in and it was great but it's only great as long as you don't think about it too hard and so of course we ruined all of it by going and thinking about it too hard I was there long enough to notice that we went through this cycle over and over again so we would release a product we would have an all-hands meeting where we'd say hey we released this thing and everybody would applaud and scream and be happy about it and then you wouldn't hear much about it for a while and then two years later we'd turn it off because nobody ever used it we did that over and over again a good example of that is this product called alchemy the general idea there was that you could come to Etsy describe an item that you wanted to buy and then Etsy sellers could bid on making it for you and that is a really cool idea it got written up in the New York Times a couple of times it was generally perceived to be great but by 2011 we just turned it off and it's entire three-year lifetime alchemy sold fewer items then fewer items than the Etsy the rest of the site sells over the course of a day so it was a huge bust then around this time I had had enough of this and I thought I was very selfishly hey is there any way I personally could avoid participating in projects like this because I have this weird thing about me where I'd like to just completely waste my time doing things like that around the same time we started a/b testing stuff and I kind of latched on to that as a solution maybe so the idea there would be instead of just pushing something out to all of traffic and then praying what we would do instead would be push something out and only give it to half of people and then make some sort of objective measurement about whether or not they were behaving the way we wanted them to and the thing we discovered almost immediately upon doing that is oh my god we're nowhere near as good at our jobs as we thought that we were what happened most of the time was that we would push a project put push something out a B test it and nothing would happen it was just crickets there would be no no reaction whatsoever no metrics would move what happened occasionally would be that things got worse usually only slightly worse but nevertheless worse the thing that never happened was that we would release something and then and there'd be this major improvement in any metrics that we cared about the problem at the time I think was that we were still picking products based on what sounds the best but a critical thing had changed my slide screwed up a critical thing had changed but and that was that we had added this objective measurement of how well we were doing and so I think at that point it would have been a popular decision to stop measuring but that would have been very disingenuous right we'd opened up Pandora's box by seeing how good we were doing and we couldn't just like close it again and say well the hell with it but over time like we did figure out ways to improve our batting average and I'm gonna talk through that now so to recap in the very beginning we'd come up with an idea spend a ton of time building it and then we'd push it out a little later we added this a be testing step to it although most of the time the a/b testing step took a lot longer than we intended it to take because we weren't getting the results we wanted to get sometimes we never got the result that we wanted to get and we would just have to throw out everything we were doing and that sucked that hurt a lot but by about 2012 we settled into a process that looked a lot more like this and it's a little more complicated but there a good reason for it the core idea there is that instead of just like coming up with an idea and then off to the races go build it you use data to try and figure out first if you can how good of an idea it is another critical part of it is that you don't over invest in the building step because experience tells us most things don't work out the way you initially conceived them UAB tests a minimal version of it first and then you go back later you refine it and then you do subsequent a B tests to get to some point where you are comfortable releasing something to all traffic great thing about this process is that it gives you at least two places early on where you can just give up those are much cheaper than doing it at the very end you still retain the option of giving up at the very end of the process but you don't have to exercise it that often if you give yourself more chances so rather than just leave you with that abstraction I'm going to go through two examples these are both products that we at least talked about building at Etsy at some point and I think that the notable thing about these is that neither of them sounds completely crazy the first time you hear it here it said so the first one is let's build a landing page for local furniture so that slide is screwed up again anyway the the idea here is Etsy has these landing pages for all of its categories it has one for furniture too the thing that's notable about furniture is furniture is really heavy and that makes it really hard to sell on the Internet so the idea here would be let's only show people furniture that's close to them geographically and then maybe they'll buy more of it that sounds like a reasonable idea the first thing I would do there would be to say okay who's gonna see this thing in this case it turns out a lot of people would see it so the pages we're talking about changing aren't the most important pages on Etsy by any means but they're in the top five which in the context of Etsy is a whole lot of traffic obviously not all that's for furniture but a good bit of it is for furniture so so far so good now if you dig a little bit deeper what you find is that unfortunately not very many people buy items that they find on these pages if you compare it to a page like search search has a ton of traffic and many many people find products that they wind up buying using search but not very many people find products they wind up buying using these pages so that makes this look a little bit worse now hold on a minute though furniture like I said it's very heavy it's also very expensive so maybe although we're not going to sell many more pieces of furniture the ones we do sell will be worth a lot so maybe it may still make sense to do this we'll make it up that way so if you imagine that the average item on Etsy is worth about $40 and it's not like I have to fake a bunch of financial numbers here it's not $40 but let's imagine that it is let's say that the average item of furniture that we're going to sell will be 10 times that it's going to be $400 and so from here we have enough inputs where we can start to reason about what it would mean to for us to improve the state of the world by changing this page that's an equation that looks like this we have a certain number of visits to the these pages they convert into purchases at some rate the each one of those purchases is worth some amount and then we're going to improve that by some percentage I talked through how we estimate the first three terms there and now we're gonna see what different values for how much we're gonna change things would affect the world so that's what this looks like over the course of a year this would this is what it would mean to improve purchasing behavior by half a percent through two percent I chose those percentages based mostly on past experience with doing a/b tests on these kinds of pages usually you don't affect people's behavior all that much I think that change in two percent would be really hitting it out of the park but let's say that we really do hit it out of the park and we change people we make people 2 percent more likely to buy what that would mean would be that so you would sell three hundred and sixty thousand dollars more stuff more furniture over the course of a year a critical piece of context there though is that Etsy is a marketplace so most of the value goes to the people selling the items of furniture Etsy only keeps three and a half percent of the sale price so that's thirteen thousand dollars now if you imagine that a to developers a product manager a designer all of their HR overhead all of their managerial overhead their health insurance and all of that is devoted to this for a month or two then this makes this not look very attractive you can realize that oh it's it's gonna take at sea a very long time to earn back the what they invest in this if we do this and so I would say at this point let's go work on something else whereas in the past what we would have done would would have been we would have stopped that idea and said that sounds like a pretty good idea go but go build that second idea I'm gonna go through is emailing people that give up in the middle of purchases so Etsy like every e-commerce site that exists has this shopping cart you add stuff to your cart you fill out your shipping information you fill out your credit card information and then you check out and people can and do give up at every step along the way so the idea here would be for the people who give up along the way let's wait like five days send them an email and say hey did you really intend to buy that thing because you didn't maybe you just close the tab accidentally it happens something like that and so modeling that looks like this we have a certain number of users per day who are eligible for that email they have some average value of stuff in their cart and we're gonna be successful by some percentage at getting them to come back and finish buying so if we model that in the same way it looks like this it I chose percentages of our success rate at being between one and five percent I think that a higher guess is reasonable in this case because these are much more engaged users first of all we know their email address and then second of all they're halfway down the checkout funnel already so I think that we could postulate that we're gonna be slightly more successful at getting them to come back and buy but let's be conservative here and say well we're only gonna get one percent more of them to come back and buy with this what would that mean in this case what that would mean is that Etsy would sell three million dollars more stuff or Etsy would keep a hundred thousand dollars more and so that looks a lot more attractive and I would say this is a good example of a product that we should go ahead and build and I actually did build that one while I was at Etsy and it wound up being by the time I left anyway between a half percent and 1 percent of all of Etsy sales we may not sound extremely impressive but I assure you that that's epic and so I I I hope that you can see that with just applying the most the stupidest possible math to the situation we can make one an idea look really bad and make one idea look really good when the first time you hear them they both sound like pretty good ideas so if I can generalize for just a minute the the metaphor that I have in my head when I'm doing this kind of work not to be excessively grandiose or anything as Archimedes with his lever our committee's famously said give me a place to stand and I can move the entire earth and so what you're doing when you're going through a big set of ideas and trying to apply data to them to see if they're good or not is you're searching the solution space for a place where you can stand to apply your effort to actually make a difference the questions you should be asking yourself when you're doing this is how many people do I have what are they like a important thing to note is that it's only I think it's only important to be correct within an order of magnitude that's great I think that what you'll find is if you just rely on hunches if you don't do any of this work you're not even going to be correct within an order of magnitude so closes close is good enough I think that it's still legitimate to do products just because they sound cool sometimes but the key word there is sometimes and I think how often may depend on where you are if your startup you're not going to have a lot of data to be able to do like fine grained analysis like this you may be able you may have some data you may have other people's data you can still draw a box around products and maybe your error Mart margin of error is just gonna be a lot bigger other things you can do is a start-up would be to work on tools to make doing this easier as you go along and accumulate data you can work on accumulating the data and then again if you're a very mature company you're not you will have lots of data and mature tools and a budget to do this for everything if you want but I still think it's legitimate to occasionally just take a shot at the moon once in a while so I want to leave you with a couple of thoughts so I started this I started in this journey trying to come up with a reasonable answer to what we should build and to win these arguments and I think the conclusion that I came to is that if somebody walks up to you and says I know what we should build and they can't show you any of this work you should run away from that person as fast as possible I think that a lot of ideas sound really good but I think that sounding awesome is not a remarkable feature of a product idea I think it's completely natural if you are like me an employee at a startup to think Oh CEOs doing this oh my boss is doing this in other situations you might think oh my employees are doing this for me but in my experience nobody's doing this nobody does this at all like you should ask you should you should you should do it yourself you should build tools so that everybody can do it getting access to data is kind of a tricky problem but actually doing this analysis is easy I've met tons of people in my life who just say things like they just want to build cool things or whatever and like I was like that too I just want to build cool things but I think that having an impact really having an impact is a really cool thing so

so most of the value goes to the people selling the items of furniture Etsy only keeps three and a half percent of the sale price so that's thirteen thousand dollars now if you imagine that a to developers a product manager a designer all of their HR overhead all of their managerial overhead their health insurance and all of that is devoted to this for a month or two then this makes this not look very attractive you can realize that oh it's it's gonna take at sea a very long time to earn back the what they invest in this if we do this and so I would say at this point let's go work on something else whereas in the past what we would have done would would have been we would have stopped that idea and said that sounds like a pretty good idea go but go build that second idea I'm gonna go through is emailing people that give up in the middle of purchases so Etsy like every e-commerce site that exists has this shopping cart you add stuff to your cart you fill out your shipping information you fill out your credit card information and then you check out and people can and do give up at every step along the way so the idea here would be for the people who give up along the way let's wait like five days send them an email and say hey did you really intend to buy that thing because you didn't maybe you just close the tab accidentally it happens something like that and so modeling that looks like this we have a certain number of users per day who are eligible for that email they have some average value of stuff in their cart and we're gonna be successful by some percentage at getting them to come back and finish buying so if we model that in the same way it looks like this it I chose percentages of our success rate at being between one and five percent I think that a higher guess is reasonable in this case because these are much more engaged users first of all we know their email address and then second of all they're halfway down the checkout funnel already so I think that we could postulate that we're gonna be slightly more successful at getting them to come back and buy but let's be conservative here and say well we're only gonna get one percent more of them to come back and buy with this what would that mean in this case what that would mean is that Etsy would sell three million dollars more stuff or Etsy would keep a hundred thousand dollars more and so that looks a lot more attractive and I would say this is a good example of a product that we should go ahead and build and I actually did build that one while I was at Etsy and it wound up being by the time I left anyway between a half percent and 1 percent of all of Etsy sales we may not sound extremely impressive but I assure you that that's epic and so I I I hope that you can see that with just applying the most the stupidest possible math to the situation we can make one an idea look really bad and make one idea look really good when the first time you hear them they both sound like pretty good ideas so if I can generalize for just a minute the the metaphor that I have in my head when I'm doing this kind of work not to be excessively grandiose or anything as Archimedes with his lever our committee's famously said give me a place to stand and I can move the entire earth and so what you're doing when you're going through a big set of ideas and trying to apply data to them to see if they're good or not is you're searching the solution space for a place where you can stand to apply your effort to actually make a difference the questions you should be asking yourself when you're doing this is how many people do I have what are they like a important thing to note is that it's only I think it's only important to be correct within an order of magnitude that's great I think that what you'll find is if you just rely on hunches if you don't do any of this work you're not even going to be correct within an order of magnitude so closes close is good enough I think that it's still legitimate to do products just because they sound cool sometimes but the key word there is sometimes and I think how often may depend on where you are if your startup you're not going to have a lot of data to be able to do like fine grained analysis like this you may be able you may have some data you may have other people's data you can still draw a box around products and maybe your error Mart margin of error is just gonna be a lot bigger other things you can do is a start-up would be to work on tools to make doing this easier as you go along and accumulate data you can work on accumulating the data and then again if you're a very mature company you're not you will have lots of data and mature tools and a budget to do this for everything if you want but I still think it's legitimate to occasionally just take a shot at the moon once in a while so I want to leave you with a couple of thoughts so I started this I started in this journey trying to come up with a reasonable answer to what we should build and to win these arguments and I think the conclusion that I came to is that if somebody walks up to you and says I know what we should build and they can't show you any of this work you should run away from that person as fast as possible I think that a lot of ideas sound really good but I think that sounding awesome is not a remarkable feature of a product idea I think it's completely natural if you are like me an employee at a startup to think Oh CEOs doing this oh my boss is doing this in other situations you might think oh my employees are doing this for me but in my experience nobody's doing this nobody does this at all like you should ask you should you should you should do it yourself you should build tools so that everybody can do it getting access to data is kind of a tricky problem but actually doing this analysis is easy I've met tons of people in my life who just say things like they just want to build cool things or whatever and like I was like that too I just want to build cool things but I think that having an impact really having an impact is a really cool thing so thanks"

        "text": "so this the entirety of this talk is about my time at Etsy I don't work there anymore but I had a great time there and I learned a lot and I'm not done talking about it I'll tell you just a little bit about what Etsy is it's a marketplace for handmade and vintage goods it's sold well over a billion dollars of stuff in 2013 probably more this year so Etsy's really big but when I got my start there it was really small it was less than 20 people when I started and that journey from point A to point B was a really wild ride it there was a lot of arguing about a lot of stuff there were three CEO changes while I was there the thing we argued about the most was this what do we spend our time on so at all points what we told ourselves about that was this we should try to be data-driven now somebody had heard that Google was data-driven we really wanted to be like Google and so we said okay we're gonna be data-driven too and there was one problem with that which is that nobody had any idea what that meant or what that would imply so what you would get all the time was something like this somebody would have a project that they wanted to get scheduled and they would sprinkle some numbers on it and call it data-driven it was like this weird display behavior but over time I did start to figure out what it would mean to actually choose what we work on using data and I also realized that it was not that difficult and that's what the rest of this talk is about so I want to talk you through how I figured all that stuff out and that starts back in 2007 I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea here and think that I'm talking smack about Etsy in its early days I'm definitely not it was a magical place it was awesome and I missed 2007 all the time but I also think it's really important to be honest about it and the truth of the matter is that Etsy didn't grow geometrically because of the carefully planned and executed activities of its employees it grew geometrically because it was like striking oil bets he was this thing that was out there waiting for somebody to discover it but just as human beings were not really hardwired to see things that way we tend to think that if you do something and it's a big success then the things that you did before it was successful must have caused that success that's just human nature and we took that into the product as well we thought well we built this thing and people really loved it and so that's just a repeatable process and we didn't really question ourselves too much we thought well if you build it they will come and the crazy thing about that is that if growth is really this big externality then no matter what you do it looks like it's working as long as you don't completely destroy the core functionality of the site you can do literally anything you want and all the grafts go up into the right and that was the situation we found ourselves in and it was great but it's only great as long as you don't think about it too hard and so of course we ruined all of it by going and thinking about it too hard I was there long enough to notice that we went through this cycle over and over again so we would release a product we would have an all-hands meeting where we'd say hey we released this thing and everybody would applaud and scream and be happy about it and then you wouldn't hear much about it for a while and then two years later we'd turn it off because nobody ever used it we did that over and over again a good example of that is this product called alchemy the general idea there was that you could come to Etsy describe an item that you wanted to buy and then Etsy sellers could bid on making it for you and that is a really cool idea it got written up in the New York Times a couple of times it was generally perceived to be great but by 2011 we just turned it off and it's entire three-year lifetime alchemy sold fewer items then fewer items than the Etsy the rest of the site sells over the course of a day so it was a huge bust then around this time I had had enough of this and I thought I was very selfishly hey is there any way I personally could avoid participating in projects like this because I have this weird thing about me where I'd like to just completely waste my time doing things like that around the same time we started a/b testing stuff and I kind of latched on to that as a solution maybe so the idea there would be instead of just pushing something out to all of traffic and then praying what we would do instead would be push something out and only give it to half of people and then make some sort of objective measurement about whether or not they were behaving the way we wanted them to and the thing we discovered almost immediately upon doing that is oh my god we're nowhere near as good at our jobs as we thought that we were what happened most of the time was that we would push a project put push something out a B test it and nothing would happen it was just crickets there would be no no reaction whatsoever no metrics would move what happened occasionally would be that things got worse usually only slightly worse but nevertheless worse the thing that never happened was that we would release something and then and there'd be this major improvement in any metrics that we cared about the problem at the time I think was that we were still picking products based on what sounds the best but a critical thing had changed my slide screwed up a critical thing had changed but and that was that we had added this objective measurement of how well we were doing and so I think at that point it would have been a popular decision to stop measuring but that would have been very disingenuous right we'd opened up Pandora's box by seeing how good we were doing and we couldn't just like close it again and say well the hell with it but over time like we did figure out ways to improve our batting average and I'm gonna talk through that now so to recap in the very beginning we'd come up with an idea spend a ton of time building it and then we'd push it out a little later we added this a be testing step to it although most of the time the a/b testing step took a lot longer than we intended it to take because we weren't getting the results we wanted to get sometimes we never got the result that we wanted to get and we would just have to throw out everything we were doing and that sucked that hurt a lot but by about 2012 we settled into a process that looked a lot more like this and it's a little more complicated but there a good reason for it the core idea there is that instead of just like coming up with an idea and then off to the races go build it you use data to try and figure out first if you can how good of an idea it is another critical part of it is that you don't over invest in the building step because experience tells us most things don't work out the way you initially conceived them UAB tests a minimal version of it first and then you go back later you refine it and then you do subsequent a B tests to get to some point where you are comfortable releasing something to all traffic great thing about this process is that it gives you at least two places early on where you can just give up those are much cheaper than doing it at the very end you still retain the option of giving up at the very end of the process but you don't have to exercise it that often if you give yourself more chances so rather than just leave you with that abstraction I'm going to go through two examples these are both products that we at least talked about building at Etsy at some point and I think that the notable thing about these is that neither of them sounds completely crazy the first time you hear it here it said so the first one is let's build a landing page for local furniture so that slide is screwed up again anyway the the idea here is Etsy has these landing pages for all of its categories it has one for furniture too the thing that's notable about furniture is furniture is really heavy and that makes it really hard to sell on the Internet so the idea here would be let's only show people furniture that's close to them geographically and then maybe they'll buy more of it that sounds like a reasonable idea the first thing I would do there would be to say okay who's gonna see this thing in this case it turns out a lot of people would see it so the pages we're talking about changing aren't the most important pages on Etsy by any means but they're in the top five which in the context of Etsy is a whole lot of traffic obviously not all that's for furniture but a good bit of it is for furniture so so far so good now if you dig a little bit deeper what you find is that unfortunately not very many people buy items that they find on these pages if you compare it to a page like search search has a ton of traffic and many many people find products that they wind up buying using search but not very many people find products they wind up buying using these pages so that makes this look a little bit worse now hold on a minute though furniture like I said it's very heavy it's also very expensive so maybe although we're not going to sell many more pieces of furniture the ones we do sell will be worth a lot so maybe it may still make sense to do this we'll make it up that way so if you imagine that the average item on Etsy is worth about $40 and it's not like I have to fake a bunch of financial numbers here it's not $40 but let's imagine that it is let's say that the average item of furniture that we're going to sell will be 10 times that it's going to be $400 and so from here we have enough inputs where we can start to reason about what it would mean to for us to improve the state of the world by changing this page that's an equation that looks like this we have a certain number of visits to the these pages they convert into purchases at some rate the each one of those purchases is worth some amount and then we're going to improve that by some percentage I talked through how we estimate the first three terms there and now we're gonna see what different values for how much we're gonna change things would affect the world so that's what this looks like over the course of a year this would this is what it would mean to improve purchasing behavior by half a percent through two percent I chose those percentages based mostly on past experience with doing a/b tests on these kinds of pages usually you don't affect people's behavior all that much I think that change in two percent would be really hitting it out of the park but let's say that we really do hit it out of the park and we change people we make people 2 percent more likely to buy what that would mean would be that so you would sell three hundred and sixty thousand dollars more stuff more furniture over the course of a year a critical piece of context there though is that Etsy is a marketplace so most of the value goes to the people selling the items of furniture Etsy only keeps three and a half percent of the sale price so that's thirteen thousand dollars now if you imagine that a to
