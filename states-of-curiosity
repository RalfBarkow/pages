Behavioral results from two studies revealed that states of high curiosity enhance not only learning of interesting information, but also learning of incidental material. Imaging results demonstrated that these learning benefits are related to anticipatory brain activity in the mesolimbic dopaminergic circuit including the hippocampus. In particular, curiosity-driven memory benefits for incidental material were supported by activity in the SN/VTA and the hippocampus and by increased midbrain-hippocampus functional connectivity. Importantly, the effects of curiosity on memory for incidental material were correlated with activity in the SN/VTA prior to the encoding event, accounting for more than half of the behavioral variance in incidental encoding during high curiosity states. These findings are consistent with the idea that curiosity enhances learning, at least in part, through increased dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal activity.\n\n"

This account is admittedly speculative, but it aligns with models (Goto and Grace, 2008; Lisman and Grace, 2005; Scimeca and Badre, 2012) proposing that the VTA signals salience, whereas the nucleus accumbens integrates information about salience from the VTA with information about goal-relevance conveyed by the prefrontal cortex.\n\n"

Behavioral results from two studies revealed that states of high curiosity enhance not only learning of interesting information, but also learning of incidental material. Imaging results demonstrated that these learning benefits are related to anticipatory brain activity in the mesolimbic dopaminergic circuit including the hippocampus. In particular, curiosity-driven memory benefits for incidental material were supported by activity in the SN/VTA and the hippocampus and by increased midbrain-hippocampus functional connectivity. Importantly, the effects of curiosity on memory for incidental material were correlated with activity in the SN/VTA prior to the encoding event, accounting for more than half of the behavioral variance in incidental encoding during high curiosity states. These findings are consistent with the idea that curiosity enhances learning, at least in part, through increased dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal activity.\n\n"
