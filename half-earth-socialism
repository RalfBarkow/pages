One half will be renaturalized, possibly under indigenous administration, and in the other half we will plan how much space should be used for ecologically sustainable and socially just food production, for the generation of regenerative energy, and for housing and transportation infrastructure. In the face of such hard trade-offs, gardening may seem like an unjustifiable luxury."

Basically, permanent grassland only exists where it is mowed at least once a year – as in the natural garden. The wild also needs horticultural input."

The authors outline a planned economy that operates with cybernetic models. Input and output of production processes are to be made recognizable on a global scale, set in relation to the planetary load limits and democratically negotiable."

A planned economy that focuses on short-term yield optimization would soon have to turn to the wild again, because soil is a virtually non-renewable resource. So both CO2-binding and fertility-preserving cultivation methods would have to be developed."

      "text": "The most promising trends in this area are much closer to horticultural methods than to the rationalized agriculture that characterizes current large-scale landholdings just as it once did the real-socialist agricultural sector. One key trend, for example, is attempts to re-breed annual crops – primarily arable crops such as cereals, but also vegetable varieties – for perenniality. This allows the established crops themselves to crowd out the weeds, the soil biology is not disturbed by annual plowing, and the vegetated ground cover keeps carbon in the soil. Another approach builds on the integration of trees into cropland. Hedgerows and rows of trees provide windbreaks, store moisture, and in the process, yield edibles themselves."

      "text": "Even if the wild moves into the field in this way, professional agriculture will always have to make its decisions in such a way that it prioritizes feeding people over feeding neighboring species. In addition, there is an urgent need for playful – and time-consuming – experimentation. Their place is the gardens, in which edible things grow for humans and yet which also aim to increase abundance for all species present. Sometimes, rather unplanned, both succeed at the same time: wildness and calorie production."
