Semantic matchmaking process is finding valuable service candidates for substitution. It is a very important aspect of using semantic Web Services. Our proposed matchmaker algorithm performs semantic matching of Web Services on the basis of input and output descriptions of semantic Web Services matching. This technique takes advantages from a graph structure and flow networks. Our novel approach is assigning matchmaking scores to semantics of the inputs and outputs parameters and their types. It makes a flow network in which the weights of the edges are these scores, using FordFulkerson algorithm, we find matching rate of two web services. So, all services should be described in the same Ontology Web Language. Among these candidates, best one is chosen for substitution in the case of an execution failure. Our approach uses the algorithm that has the least running time among all others that can be used for bipartite matching. The importance of problem is that in real systems, many fundamental problems will occur by late answering. So system`s service should always be on and if one of them crashes, it would be replaced fast. Semantic web matchmaker eases this process.\narXiv:2107.05368 [cs]\n\nKARABULUT, Erkan and SOFIA, Rute C., 2023. An Analysis of Machine Learning-Based Semantic Matchmaking. IEEE Access. Online. 2023.
