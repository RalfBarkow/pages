Following through with that, as per my understanding, and Agile minds follow here—why the Pattern Language + Wiki crossover was a match made in heaven—is that the primary generative force in keeping knowledge production alive is meeting and exchanging with many people, and not ordering terms in a seemingly ontic model of reality.

It extracts the video ID and start time from the URL.\n3. It converts the start time to seconds and adjusts it (in this case, subtracts 1 second).\n4. It prints the result to the Transcript, showing \"START\" followed by the adjusted start time and \"YOUTUBE\" followed by the video ID.\n5. The result is printed to the Transcript.\n\nYou can customize this method based on your specific requirements or adjust the parsing logic as needed. The provided example assumes a specific format of the YouTube URL and may need modification if the format varies. (ChatGPT 3.5)"

Conflict-free Replicated Data Types ([[CRDT]]s) are data types whose operations do not conflict with each other and, therefore, can be replicated with minimal coordination among replicas. Relevant examples of data types that can be implemented as CRDTs are counters and sets. While it is easy to ensure that all replicas of CRDTs become eventually consistent when the system becomes quiescent, different techniques can be used to propagate the updates as efficiently as possible, with different trade-offs among the amount of network traffic generated and the staleness of local information. In this report we study the different alternatives that have been used to propagate updates and discuss potential strategies to automate this selection to optimize the system operation."

Available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18220 [Accessed 18 December 2023]. \nConflict-free Replicated Data Types ([[CRDT]]s) allow optimistic replication in a principled way. Different replicas can proceed independently, being available even under network partitions, and always converging deterministically: replicas that have received the same updates will have equivalent state, even if received in different orders. After a historical tour of the evolution from sequential data types to CRDTs, we present in detail the two main approaches to CRDTs, operation-based and state-based, including two important variations, the pure operation-based and the delta-state based. Intended as a tutorial for prospective CRDT researchers and designers, it provides solid coverage of the essential concepts, clarifying some misconceptions which frequently occur, but also presents some novel insights gained from considerable experience in designing both specific CRDTs and approaches to CRDTs.\narXiv:2310.18220 [cs]\n"

Similar to the industrial context, educational institutions are adopting data-processing technologies at all levels. To achieve representative results, the processes of extraction, transformation and uploading of educational data should be ubiquitous because, without useful data, either internal or external, it is difficult to perform a proper analysis and to obtain unbiased educational results. It should be noted that the source and type of data are heterogeneous and that the analytical processes can be so diverse that it opens up a practical problem of management and access to the data generated. At the same time, ensuring the privacy, identity, confidentiality and security of students and their data is a “sine qua non” condition for complying with the legal issues involved while achieving the required ethical premises. This work proposes a modular and scalable data system architecture that solves the complexity of data management and access. On the one hand, it allows educational institutions to collect any data generated in both the teaching-learning and management processes. On the other hand, it will enable external access to this data under appropriate privacy and security conditions."

It contains the software and hardware in charge of importing data from different data sources (management and educational software of the institution, EdTech, LMS, etc.). The content imported to the ETL module can be of an encrypted and anonymized nature. Once stored, it cannot be identified by any entity but the users involved, i.e., using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption technology [62]. It can also be managed securely by employing secure connections, such as Secure Shell (SSH), Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Virtual Private Network (VPN). […] For instance, in the Moodle LMS, some of the authors managed to encrypt the user table since most of the personal data reside there and used a set of views that allow decryption or encryption at convenience. This measure can be complemented by ensuring students’ anonymity through second identities with the Protected Users plugin [32], thus not exporting data that can be used to identify people. The entire database can also be encrypted with a double user control system where not even the administrator can access or decrypt the data. Some of the authors of this paper conceived such a system and named it [[AuthChecker]] [35]; simple authentications, private and permissioned Application Program Interfaces (API), and Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) technologies are recommended to ensure data access by manually specified roles."

        "text": "To achieve this in Pharo Smalltalk, you can create a method that takes a YouTube URL as input, extracts the relevant information, and prints the result to the Transcript. Here's a simple example:\n\n```smalltalk\nObject subclass: #YouTubeUrlParser\n    instanceVariableNames: ''\n    classVariableNames: ''\n    poolDictionaries: ''\n    category: 'YourCategory'\n\nYouTubeUrlParser>>parseYouTubeUrl: url\n    | videoId startTimeSeconds |\n    \n    \"Extract video ID and start time from the URL\"\n    videoId := (url copyUpTo: '/') copyAfterLast: '/'.\n    startTimeSeconds := (url copyUpTo: '?t=') copyAfterLast: '='.\n    \n    \"Convert start time to seconds and adjust\"\n    startTimeSeconds := startTimeSeconds isEmpty ifTrue: [ 0 ] ifFalse: [ startTimeSeconds asInteger - 1 ].\n\n    \"Print the result to Transcript\"\n    Transcript show: 'START ', startTimeSeconds printString; nl.\n    Transcript show: 'YOUTUBE ', videoId; nl.\n    \n    ^ 'Result printed to Transcript.'\n\n\"Example of using the parser\"\n| urlParser url |\nurlParser := YouTubeUrlParser new.\nurl := 'https://youtu.be/90WbS30lo1Q?t=679'.\nurlParser parseYouTubeUrl: url.\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. `parseYouTubeUrl:` method takes a YouTube URL as input.\n2. It extracts the video ID and start time from the URL.\n3. It converts the start time to seconds and adjusts it (in this case, subtracts 1 second).\n4. It prints the result to the Transcript, showing \"START\" followed by the adjusted start time and \"YOUTUBE\" followed by the video ID.\n5. The result is printed to the Transcript.\n\nYou can customize this method based on your specific requirements or adjust the parsing logic as needed. The provided example assumes a specific format of the YouTube URL and may need modification if the format varies. (ChatGPT 3.5)"

Mobile network operators (MNOs) traditionally struggle to justify expansion into these rural areas due to the high infrastructure costs necessary to provide service. Community cellular networks, networks built “by and for” the people they serve, represent an alternative model that, to an extent, bypasses these business case limitations and enables sustainable rural coverage. Yet despite aligned economic incentives, real deployments of community cellular networks still face significant regulatory, commercial and technical challenges. In this paper, we present CommunityCellularManager (CCM), a system for operating community cellular networks at scale. CCM enables multiple community networks to operate under the control of a single, multi-tenant controller and in partnership with a traditional MNO. CCM preserves flexibility for each community network to operate independently, while allowing the mobile network operator to safely make critical resources such as spectrum and phone numbers available to these networks. We evaluate CCM through a multi-year, large-scale community cellular network deployment in the Philippines in partnership with Globe, the largest MNO in the country, providing basic communication services to over 2,800 people in 17 communities without requiring changes to the existing regulatory framework, and using existing handsets. We demonstrate that CCM can support independent community networks with unique service offerings and operating models while providing a basic level of MNO-defined service. To our knowledge, this represents the largest deployment of community cellular networks to date."

Its design presents original solutions to scalability issues, namely restructuring the tree without violating commutativity, supporting very large and variable numbers of writable replicas, and leveraging the data structure to ensure causal ordering without vector clocks."

[…] For instance, in the Moodle LMS, some of the authors managed to encrypt the user table since most of the personal data reside there and used a set of views that allow decryption or encryption at convenience. This measure can be complemented by ensuring students’ anonymity through second identities with the Protected Users plugin [32], thus not exporting data that can be used to identify people. The entire database can also be encrypted with a double user control system where not even the administrator can access or decrypt the data. Some of the authors of this paper conceived such a system and named it AuthChecker [35]; simple authentications, private and permissioned Application Program Interfaces (API), and Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) technologies are recommended to ensure data access by manually specified roles."

Similar to the industrial context, educational institutions are adopting data-processing technologies at all levels. To achieve representative results, the processes of extraction, transformation and uploading of educational data should be ubiquitous because, without useful data, either internal or external, it is difficult to perform a proper analysis and to obtain unbiased educational results. It should be noted that the source and type of data are heterogeneous and that the analytical processes can be so diverse that it opens up a practical problem of management and access to the data generated. At the same time, ensuring the privacy, identity, confidentiality and security of students and their data is a “sine qua non” condition for complying with the legal issues involved while achieving the required ethical premises. This work proposes a modular and scalable data system architecture that solves the complexity of data management and access. On the one hand, it allows educational institutions to collect any data generated in both the teaching-learning and management processes. On the other hand, it will enable external access to this data under appropriate privacy and security conditions."

I see that [[AbstractFileReference]]>>#gtSpotterForDirectoriesFor: & [[AbstractFileReference]]>>#gtSpotterForFilesFor: exist but they only match on filenames when searching a directory (so these should also probably be scoped only on directories and not files as a magnifying glass on a file shows intent that the file can be searchable when it doesn't really do anything right now)."
