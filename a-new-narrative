      "text": "Our world is shaped by the stories told and they are also fundamental to change processes. What makes a story powerful is not necessarily the facts themselves, but how the story creates meaning in the hearts and minds of the listeners. This means the main obstacle to convincing people of the need for change is often not linked to what they don’t yet know, but actually what they already do know. In other words, our existing mindsets, the assumptions and beliefs held, can act as narrative filters to prevent us from hearing social change messages."

Despite rhetoric about change, we, unfortunately, continue to deliver an industrial-age model of learning. In the social construct of our schools, educators essentially maintain the system they know. This paradigm is one in which the product (assignment, test score, graded task) is more important than the learning process."

Challenging and confronting dominant norms, values and beliefs around schooling and devising alternative futures is not a simple task. If we are to change the narrative and reframe the discourse of schooling we must be savvy about the language we choose and find new sources of eloquence and leadership. This change requires the emerging understanding that this journey is not about knowing, but feeling... it's about learning and cultivating wisdom."

We expect our educators to batch children by age, implement a restrictive year-level curriculum, constantly assess and grade, ultimately prepare children for high-stakes tests, and to complete all the requisite mandatory training and paperwork the education system produces. We remain overly concerned about the deficits in children, teachers, and schools, and not concerned enough about the potential in all learners."

We have garnered efficiencies and effectiveness by this approach. However, the significant investment in the drive for school improvement has not produced the desired outcomes. It’s apparent that improving ‘results’ in terms of what is measured, and therefore deemed important, is merely tinkering with a system that, if not already, is becoming obsolete. We need to go beyond the limits we define ourselves."

While there are some indications as to what this ‘new narrative’ of education might look like, the details are still emerging. A reimagining of schooling in which learners do not become students, and learning is about coming alive, not test scores and grades is our goal. Also necessary is finding our voice to show the world what is possible and also understanding what it is that is holding us Back and seeking learning beyond what we think we know."

What makes a story powerful is not necessarily the facts themselves, but how the story creates meaning in the hearts and minds of the listeners. This means the main obstacle to convincing people of the need for change is often not linked to what they don’t yet know, but actually what they already do know. In other words, people’s existing assumptions and beliefs can act as narrative filters to prevent them from hearing social change messages."
