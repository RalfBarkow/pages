      "text": "> This study is inspired by the result of a previous study which found that student skills in managing mathematical concepts to solve mathematics are very low. Students find difficulties in searching, applying, or choosing the problem-solving procedures. By considering this issue, the researchers aim to discover the process of managing knowledge to find flexible solutions with conceptual basis while understanding the symbols used, both as the process and concept to solve mathematical problems. Procept in this paper is defined as the symbol that expresses process and concept. This study was a qualitative-explorative descriptive research. The research subject was determined by giving mathematics skill test to 42 Junior High School students as the subject, thus, five high-skilled students were acquired, while 22 students fell into the moderate category, and 15 students fell into the low category. The characterization for the illustration of procept skills of each category is formulated. Data collecting was conducted by implementing a task-based interview, and was analysed by applying the qualitative data analysis technique performed through data reduction, data presentation, and conclusion drawing. Research results show that in the formation stages of procept (pre-procedure, procedure, multi-procedure, process, procept), subjects with high and moderate skills of mathematics have reached the procept stage, while subjects with low mathematical skills are in the stage between the procedural and multi-procedural.\n"
