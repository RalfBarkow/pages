There, he was favorably impressed by the \"handling of the press without political correctness.\" Already at that time, a cooperation between the two states was announced in a grandiose manner, but it is more about ideological common ground and smaller projects, such as an academic exchange program, the scope of which is to amount to exactly 504 Brazilian students at Hungarian universities. Likewise, the purchase of two military transport aircraft \"with jet propulsion\" from Brazil is to serve as an example of military cooperation. This is more than modest compared to the two billion euros that Hungary agreed to spend in 2020 on an order for 218 tanks from the German company [[Rheinmetall]]."

Bolsonaro justified this with economic ties to Russia that are important for Brazil and that he does not want to subordinate to the political dictates of the United States. In fact, however, Russia is not one of Brazil's relevant trading partners. The staging of nationalist countervailing power is above all an attempt to conceal how much one depends on one's own Western allies and trading partners."

Until now, he said, historical science had reacted with a strong reluctance to the theory, which had been condemned as \"conservative\" and \"hypercomplex,\" and had thus disregarded an inspiring interlocutor. On the other hand, Luhmann himself repeatedly raised the question of structural changes and examined social developments for their difference between before and after. This can be seen, for example, in Luhmann's sense for the problematic nature of modern self-descriptions through terms such as \"people\" or \"[[sovereignty]],\" which were originally developed to enforce programmatics, not to describe states of affairs. Winterling's leading dialectical question was then: What do we get in and what do we get out of view when we look at pre-modern societies from the perspective of systems theory?"

In conclusion, there was agreement on wanting to accept the \"holistic challenge\" of systems theory and to try out its claim to universality.

Enforcement of its goals relies on voluntary compliance by its members. Restoring voting rights is unlikely to significantly increase Russia's willingness to implement the ECHR. But further escalation will not achieve the Council of Europe's goals either. And even less so by a Russian withdrawal."

The politics of nuclear arms control between the United States and Russia are in a protracted state of crisis, which is in need of explanation. This article provides an overview of bilateral contractual milestones from 1972 to 2001 and analyzes instances of cooperation through the lens of three key factors that have influenced the process. It then considers the changes that these factors have undergone over twenty years of crisis in bilateral arms control from 2001 to 2021 and gauges the possible consequences of a continuation of the current situation. It concludes that during the first period, a shared willingness to shield the bilateral process from political disruption, U.S. bipartisan support, and cooperatively addressing the vertical diffusion of offensive and defensive missile capabilities were both possible and necessary for ensuring success. During the second period, these key factors underwent significant changes and ultimately had a negative effect on the bilateral process, which makes the current crisis unique compared to earlier episodes of regression. Most importantly, both sides were no longer willing to shield the bilateral process in its entirety during this period, including defensive and sub-strategic offensive elements. With a view to future consequences, these findings point to reduced arms race stability, weaker negotiated outcomes, and an erosion of the global nonproliferation regime."

Notable carriers for these weapons include the new Yasen nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines and Admiral Gorshkov class frigates. The Air Force’s Tu-22M3M modernized bomber and modified MiG-31K interceptor carry the hypersonic, nuclear-capable Kh-47M2 Kinzhal missile, posing a credible threat against high-profile NATO military assets like carrier strike groups (CSG’s). The Russian Ground Forces’ recent Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile system can also accept nuclear warheads."

The idea of implicit layers is defining conditions which the output has to satisfy. In Deep Equilibrium Models, the output is the fixpoint of a function that is conditioned on the input. In Neural ODEs, the output is the solution of a differential equation (evaluated at a certain time step into the [[future]])."

Mit „Dr. Seltsam oder: Wie ich lernte die Bombe zu lieben“ (#DrStrangelove) ist es jedoch etwas anders. Der Film ist eine direkte Antwort auf die Kubakrise, wenn auch eine sehr artifizielle und bitterböse. Peter Sellers schlüpft in gleich drei Rollen, unter anderem in die der Titelfigur, die die Welt brennen sehen möchte und einfach die rechte Hand nicht stillhalten kann. Was aber hat uns der 1964 in den Kinos gestartete Film heute noch zu sagen? Der Kalte Krieg ist schließlich längst vorüber. Doch die atomare Bedrohung ist es keineswegs – viele Länder rüsten immer weiter auf, und noch immer glauben führende Politiker an die Idee der #Abschreckungspolitik, die dieser #Klassiker schwarzhumorig als Illusion entlarvt.

Orbán zählt Brasilien und Ungarn außerdem zu einer »Koalition der Nüchternen, die nicht möchten, dass sich die Welt als Ergebnis der Migration verändert«. Daher beschlossen die Staatsoberhäupter bei ihrem Treffen, ihr Vorgehen gegen internationale Migrationsabkommen zu koordinieren und ein »Frühwarnsystem« einzurichten. Ungarn und Brasilien lehnen den UN-Migrationspakt von 2019 ab."

Matthias Pohlig pleaded for the extension of the concept of actor - rather neglected by Luhmann himself - to non-humans: not only humans are involved in communication, but also computers, gods, ghosts, bots or doorstops - \"whoever is responsive is a social actor\"."

Not the large circle, this was noted several times, but to those who are not deterred by its emergent expression, it opens up new worlds. In the final discussion, there was brief confusion about how \"metahistorical\" Luhmann's theory should actually be understood, whether it serves the researcher more as a conceptual toolbox or as a means of \"breaking down the dependence on social language use\" (Schlögl) - but this disagreement quickly turned out to be a productive misunderstanding. In conclusion, there was agreement on wanting to accept the \"holistic challenge\" of systems theory and to try out its claim to universality. Aloys Winterling, one hears, is writing a book about Caesar. After his \"Caligula\", we can look forward to another dazzling example of application."

Although Russia did not remedy the legal problems underlying the numerous judgments of the ECHR, it paid damages to the plaintiffs and the political leadership regularly reaffirmed the importance of rule-of-law reforms. Individual rulings were implemented time and again."

It is based on the idea of special Russian values. Western liberalism, which underlies human rights, leads to a crisis of morality and a threat to Russian Christian Western values, the traditional family and patriotism. It puts the individual before the state and destabilizes Russia. Human rights are being misused by the West as a political instrument, as they were during the Cold War.\n\n"

It is based on the idea of special Russian values. Western liberalism, which underlies human rights, leads to a crisis of morality and a threat to Russian Christian Western values, the traditional family and patriotism. It puts the individual before the state and destabilizes Russia. Human rights are being misused by the West as a political instrument, as they were during the Cold War.\n"

The politics of nuclear arms control between the United States and Russia are in a protracted state of crisis, which is in need of explanation. This article provides an overview of bilateral contractual milestones from 1972 to 2001 and analyzes instances of cooperation through the lens of three key factors that have influenced the process. It then considers the changes that these factors have undergone over twenty years of crisis in bilateral arms control from 2001 to 2021 and gauges the possible consequences of a continuation of the current situation. It concludes that during the first period, a shared willingness to shield the bilateral process from political disruption, U.S. bipartisan support, and cooperatively addressing the vertical diffusion of offensive and defensive missile capabilities were both possible and necessary for ensuring success. During the second period, these key factors underwent significant changes and ultimately had a negative effect on the bilateral process, which makes the current crisis unique compared to earlier episodes of regression. Most importantly, both sides were no longer willing to shield the bilateral process in its entirety during this period, including defensive and sub-strategic offensive elements. With a view to future consequences, these findings point to reduced arms race stability, weaker negotiated outcomes, and an erosion of the global nonproliferation regime."

Freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of association are understood as prerequisites for democracy, and the media as guarantors of it. This includes a duty on the part of states to protect and create institutional conditions for pluralistic democratic discourse. In principle, member states are entitled to intervene in these freedoms if this is necessary to protect democratic society. However, such interference may only take place on the basis of a law that is clearly formulated. Hardly any Russian law meets these requirements. Characteristic of the Russian system is the repression of political opposition and the verticality of power. There is no independent judiciary. Law and justice are instruments of politics. Extremely contradictory, indeterminate legislation is a prerequisite for the intended arbitrariness and insecurity."

In response, the Russian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was deprived of its voting rights on April 10, 2014. Russian delegates have since been excluded from important fundamental decisions, such as the election of ECtHR judges. This further undermines the legitimacy of the ECHR in Russia. As a result, Russia stopped its contribution payments to the Council of Europe in the summer of 2017. For the Council of Europe, this led to serious financial difficulties. Since the lifting of sanctions is tied to the return of Crimea, and this is unlikely to happen, cooperation seems to have reached a political impasse."

By criticizing the ECHR, the courts can in turn prove their loyalty to the Kremlin, which serves internal unity."

        "text": "[[Stanley Kubrick]] ist ein Solitär in der Filmgeschichte. Seine Werke sind rätselhaft, sie stehen für sich und entziehen sich tagesaktuellen Bezügen. Mit „Dr. Seltsam oder: Wie ich lernte die Bombe zu lieben“ (#DrStrangelove) ist es jedoch etwas anders. Der Film ist eine direkte Antwort auf die Kubakrise, wenn auch eine sehr artifizielle und bitterböse. Peter Sellers schlüpft in gleich drei Rollen, unter anderem in die der Titelfigur, die die Welt brennen sehen möchte und einfach die rechte Hand nicht stillhalten kann. Was aber hat uns der 1964 in den Kinos gestartete Film heute noch zu sagen? Der Kalte Krieg ist schließlich längst vorüber. Doch die atomare Bedrohung ist es keineswegs – viele Länder rüsten immer weiter auf, und noch immer glauben führende Politiker an die Idee der #Abschreckungspolitik, die dieser #Klassiker schwarzhumorig als Illusion entlarvt.

We are dealing with a two-stage process of conditioned co-production, as a consequence of which the SELF re-enters itself as a doer and experiencer."
