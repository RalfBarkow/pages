        "text": "## Purpose of the events\n\nThose of us with an engineering mindset, may see little purpose in such an event or \"party\" - however this is misreading the purpose of such an event. The purpose is quite simply to provide a clear project management infrastructure which is motivational to the diverse set of participants that we will need to build this network. This methodology has been evaluated over a number of years, and based on discussions and interviews with around a dozen co-living and co-working projects. It is not based on theory but on the evaluation of the practice of such organisations in the use of currency and governance mechanisms - particularly projects that involve a mix of technology, art and creativity and wider community engagement.\n\nThe combination of a larger annual cycle, punctuated by regular monthly or shorter cycles is a familiar, well tested and is readily amenable to combine with an agile development methodology. Regular monthly \"product-planning\" meetings which discuss progress with a wide range of stake-holders can readily be mapped to a podcast that helps grow the community and interest in the project.\n\nThe podcast and annual event can act as a key motivational factor for artists key to exhibit their work, and also act as a framework to engage in a slower overview of the direction of the project. In Googles GIST terminology the annual cycle provides an opportunity to refactor project goals, and select a series of step-projects and OKR's for the year. Each pod-cast production cycle can adopt agile methodology designed to showcase and receive objective feedback on the progress of the project from a diverse set of expert opinions (guests invited to the podcast).\n\nTherefore, our aim here is to place the annual event within the context of a series of regular sprints, punctuated by (product) planning meetings that act as opportunities to both manage product development (activities) and engage an audience of makers that can help us build and design complex systems. We call the regular events pod-casts, and they are described in more detail below.\n\n",
