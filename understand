However, utterance of information is not communication in itself, as understanding is the selection that realizes communication. Understanding draws a distinction between information (today it is raining) and utterance (the reason why the interlocutor says that today it is raining). The realization of communication requires the understanding of this difference, between information and (responsibility for) its utterance. Understanding does not concern objective pieces of information or authentic reasons for uttering; rather, it concerns the →[[Attribution]] of selections as information and (reasons for) utterance.
