      "text": "**Abstract**: The paper focuses on instructions and procedures as the reasons that subjects fail to behave according to the predictions of game theory as observed in two person guessing game experiments. In this game, each of two people has to choose simultaneously a number between 0 and 100. The winner is the person whose chosen number is the closest to 2/3 of the average of the two numbers. The weakly dominant strategy is zero. Because of the simplicity of the game (once it is understood), the widespread failure of subjects to choose the weakly dominant strategy has been interpreted as evidence of some fundamental inability to behave strategically.\nThe experiments reported here demonstrate that the failure to act strategically is related to how the game is presented. Several different presentations are studied. Some subjects fail to recognize the game form when it is presented abstractly. When the game is transformed into the simple isomorphic game and presented in a familiar context, subjects do choose weakly dominant strategies. Suggestions for better experiment control are given."

      "text": "**Abstract**: 3 studies explored the performance of young bright, average, and retarded children in a binary-choice, social guessing game. Results suggested a 5-stage sequence of development from a total lack of recognition of the need for secrecy and deceptiveness in the first stage to the fifth stage in which the child was competitive and attempted to outwit the opponent by utilizing an irregular, shifting strategy. Stage changes were viewed in terms of increased role-taking ability. The development of competitive and deceptive hiding prior to competitive and deceptive guessing suggested that the child is able to take account of the other's perspective before he is able to take account of the-other's-taking-account-of the child's perspective. Psychometric ability seems to be a more crucial factor than age in the development of role taking at the lower end of the psychometric range, and chronological age seems to be a more crucial factor than psychometric ability at the average or above range."

While important, such exclusive attention to the endgame obscures many other questions about the nature of thinking being raised by Turing both consciously and unconsciously in his complex and multilayered text, 'Computing machinery and intelligence'."

      "text": "What is thinking and how should it be measured are two such questions. Less obvious are the questions he raises about the nature of gender and sex, the natural and the artificial, the analogue and discrete, and the biological and cultural. Inquiring with feminist eyes and ears helps to locate these other issues typically treated as irrelevant by traditional readers of this text. My hope is that by touring the text more slowly, and lingering in deconstructionist fashion on the details, one will stop reading Turing's text solely as a manifesto for artificial intelligence, and begin to see its plea for artificial beings with new gender and sexual opportunities. Like Darwin, Turing eagerly awaits, for reasons both personal and philosophical, the evolution of new forms."

He argued that story context provided extra linguistic cues which children exploited so as to assist in word identification.

The experiment consists of several periods of repeated play under alternative feedback conditions, including no-feedback conditions in which players receive no information between periods. If learning takes place only through reinforcement resulting from experienced outcomes, [[Choice]]s in the no-feedback conditions should not converge towards the Nash equilibrium. While less than under full information, there is convergence towards the equilibrium prediction in the no-feedback conditions. Varying priming given to subjects between periods does not affect the results."

The weakly dominant strategy is zero. Because of the simplicity of the game (once it is understood), the widespread failure of subjects to choose the weakly dominant strategy has been interpreted as evidence of some fundamental inability to behave strategically.\nThe experiments reported here demonstrate that the failure to act strategically is related to how the game is presented. Several different presentations are studied. Some subjects fail to recognize the game form when it is presented abstractly. When the game is transformed into the simple isomorphic game and presented in a familiar context, subjects do choose weakly dominant strategies. Suggestions for better experiment control are given."

        "text": "**Abstract**: 3 studies explored the performance of young bright, average, and retarded children in a binary-choice, social guessing game. Results suggested a 5-stage sequence of development from a total lack of recognition of the need for secrecy and deceptiveness in the first stage to the fifth stage in which the child was competitive and attempted to outwit the opponent by utilizing an irregular, shifting strategy. Stage changes were viewed in terms of increased role-taking ability. The development of competitive and deceptive hiding prior to competitive and deceptive guessing suggested that the child is able to take account of the other's perspective before he is able to take account of the-other's-taking-account-of the child's perspective. Psychometric ability seems to be a more crucial factor than age in the development of role taking at the lower end of the psychometric range, and chronological age seems to be a more crucial factor than psychometric ability at the average or above range."

        "text": "Like most discussions of Turing's test for artificial intelligence, the recent stagings of the Imitation Game in Boston focused solely on the question: did the computer think; that is, was it able to deceive its human interrogators into believing that it too was human?2 While important, such exclusive attention to the endgame obscures many other questions about the nature of thinking being raised by Turing both consciously and unconsciously in his complex and multilayered text, 'Computing machinery and intelligence'.3 What is thinking and how should it be measured are two such questions. Less obvious are the questions he raises about the nature of gender and sex, the natural and the artificial, the analogue and discrete, and the biological and cultural. Inquiring with feminist eyes and ears helps to locate these other issues typically treated as irrelevant by traditional readers of this text. My hope is that by touring the text more slowly, and lingering in deconstructionist fashion on the details, one will stop reading Turing's text solely as a manifesto for artificial intelligence, and begin to see its plea for artificial beings with new gender and sexual opportunities. Like Darwin, Turing eagerly awaits, for reasons both personal and philosophical, the evolution of new forms."
