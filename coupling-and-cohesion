Dispatch is fundamentally a system whereby the caller of some area of code does not determine the specific behaviour invoked, but one or more callees (arguments). Querying for a particular dataset and then running \"all processes\" on it implies either that the \"all processes\" will be exactly the same for every row of the dataset, or that the \"all processes\" are polymorphic in some way---but in that case the dispatch occurs in the \"all processes\", not in the query to collect data for them. As for tables being easier to read than \"OOP code attributes\", the relevant properties of code when it comes to dispatch are the signatures of methods, which in most languages are quite easy to read excepting pathological cases (methods with tens of arguments). A single [[Double Dispatch]] method in a multimethod-supporting language gives you just a list of method signatures, listing off the objects the method'll work on; a single triple-dispatch method in a multimethod-supporting language takes exactly the same form. Each [[Double Dispatch]] method implemented by hand with relational tools must have its own table, with rows corresponding to the first argument and columns to the second (or vice versa); a triple-dispatch method implemented in relational requires three dimensions, which tables do not afford. (In addition, the multimethod version does not require you to create a bunch of extra named functions. With a relational table, you need to store a name or some other identifier in the table for each possible method implementation.) The point is, a (non-pathological) implementation of multimethods as part of language core will be able to solve dispatch-class problems with much less work from the programmer than <i>any</i> implementation of the same functionality by the programmer, whether it's in relational tables or some other form. -[[David Mc Lean]]]",

Dispatch is fundamentally a system whereby the caller of some area of code does not determine the specific behaviour invoked, but one or more callees (arguments). Querying for a particular dataset and then running \"all processes\" on it implies either that the \"all processes\" will be exactly the same for every row of the dataset, or that the \"all processes\" are polymorphic in some way---but in that case the dispatch occurs in the \"all processes\", not in the query to collect data for them. As for tables being easier to read than \"OOP code attributes\", the relevant properties of code when it comes to dispatch are the signatures of methods, which in most languages are quite easy to read excepting pathological cases (methods with tens of arguments). A single [[Double Dispatch]] method in a multimethod-supporting language gives you just a list of method signatures, listing off the objects the method'll work on; a single triple-dispatch method in a multimethod-supporting language takes exactly the same form. Each [[Double Dispatch]] method implemented by hand with relational tools must have its own table, with rows corresponding to the first argument and columns to the second (or vice versa); a triple-dispatch method implemented in relational requires three dimensions, which tables do not afford. (In addition, the multimethod version does not require you to create a bunch of extra named functions. With a relational table, you need to store a name or some other identifier in the table for each possible method implementation.) The point is, a (non-pathological) implementation of multimethods as part of language core will be able to solve dispatch-class problems with much less work from the programmer than <i>any</i> implementation of the same functionality by the programmer, whether it's in relational tables or some other form. -[[David Mc Lean]]]",
