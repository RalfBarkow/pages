So we look for strategies to optimize what already exists. Social psychologist and bestselling author Harald Welzer, on the other hand, argues for a culture of stopping.\n> \n> A good year ago, the well-known sociologist Harald Welzer suffered a heart attack. The event not only changed him personally, but also his view of society. He sees our real problem in our refusal to recognize that we could fail radically – and that we and our lives will eventually be over. Those who are prepared to look from the end to the present, on the other hand, deal with this present differently. In order to practice this view of his own life, he has written an obituary of himself in his latest book. Thinking about ourselves in the sense of an obituary also helps us as a society, Welzer writes: the dictatorship of the present is most likely to be broken from an imagined future. Barbara Bleisch asks what this thinking from the future really brings and why the option of failure should be promising."

Computational notebooks—such as Azure, Databricks, and Jupyter—are a popular, interactive paradigm for data scientists to author code, analyze data, and interleave visualizations, all within a single document. Nevertheless, as data scientists incorporate more of their activities into notebooks, they encounter unexpected difficulties, or pain points, that impact their productivity and disrupt their workflow. Through a systematic, mixed-methods study using semi-structured interviews (n = 20) and survey (n = 156) with data scientists, we catalog nine pain points when working with notebooks. Our findings suggest that data scientists face numerous pain points throughout the entire workflow—from setting up notebooks to deploying to production—across many notebook environments. Our data scientists report essential notebook requirements, such as supporting data exploration and visualization. The results of our study inform and inspire the design\nof computational notebooks."

The event not only changed him personally, but also his view of society. He sees our real problem in our refusal to recognize that we could fail radically - and that we and our lives will eventually be over. Those who are prepared to look from the end to the present, on the other hand, deal with this present differently. In order to practice this view of his own life, he has written an obituary of himself in his latest book. Thinking about ourselves in the sense of an obituary also helps us as a society, Welzer writes: the dictatorship of the present is most likely to be broken from an imagined future.

Computational notebooks—such as Azure, Databricks, and Jupyter—are a popular, interactive paradigm for data scientists to author code, analyze data, and interleave visualizations, all within a single document. Nevertheless, as data\nscientists incorporate more of their activities into notebooks, they encounter unexpected difficulties, or pain points, that impact their productivity and disrupt their workflow. Through a systematic, mixed-methods study using semi-structured interviews (n = 20) and survey (n = 156) with data scientists,\nwe catalog nine pain points when working with notebooks.\nOur findings suggest that data scientists face numerous pain\npoints throughout the entire workflow—from setting up note-\nbooks to deploying to production—across many notebook\nenvironments. Our data scientists report essential notebook\nrequirements, such as supporting data exploration and visual-\nization. The results of our study inform and inspire the design\nof computational notebooks."
