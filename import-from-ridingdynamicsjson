As a young and promising actor, Alexander faced a problem which risked ending his career - his voice would become increasingly hoarse during performances, until he could barely produce any sound at all. He consulted doctors, but they could not diagnose any specific disease or cause of the hoarseness. With no clear medical cause for his problem, Alexander reasoned that he might be doing something wrong when reciting, leading him to strain or \"misuse\" his own vocal organs. As his only resort was self-help, he decided to observe his way of speaking and reciting to see whether he could spot anything unusual and to find a solution. ",

Alexander developed his technique to encourage and maintain this balance through conscious attention and control, a technique which has become applicable to a wide range of problems and aims. In short, this balance was extremely important for overall coordination and many other functions, such as breathing, posture, freedom of the joints in moving the whole body, using the arms and hands for skilled activities, staying calm under pressure, and maintaining good overall health.",

As a young and promising actor, Alexander faced a problem which risked ending his career - his voice would become increasingly hoarse during performances, until he could barely produce any sound at all. He consulted doctors, but they could not diagnose any specific disease or cause of the hoarseness. With no clear medical cause for his problem, Alexander reasoned that he might be doing something wrong when reciting, leading him to strain or \"misuse\" his own vocal organs. As his only resort was self-help, he decided to observe his way of speaking and reciting to see whether he could spot anything unusual and to find a solution. ",

Alexander gradually realised that the functioning of the voice depended on the correct balance of tension in his entire neuromuscular system, from head to toe. Alexander developed his technique to encourage and maintain this balance through conscious attention and control, a technique which has become applicable to a wide range of problems and aims. In short, this balance was extremely important for overall coordination and many other functions, such as breathing, posture, freedom of the joints in moving the whole body, using the arms and hands for skilled activities, staying calm under pressure, and maintaining good overall health.",

Generally speaking, wider and shorter makes for more stability; shapes with weight distributed lower down are more stable. This is why double pony trailers tend to be better balanced than single horse ones. The chassis on the trailer also adds to the comfort of the ride. This needs to be stable but not rigid otherwise the horses would bounce around with every slight change in road surface. The “chassis” for our seat is our pelvis and the muscles around it – our “core” muscles!",

Breathe in to the back of your ribs; as you breathe out let all your insides sink down whilst maintaining the structure of your bones (ie don’t collapse your spine).  Check that your ribs haven’t flared out and they have release them down again. Release in the area where your leg joins on; then stabilise the upper body above this and let the lower leg hang. Feel the support of the stirrups on the ball of your foot. Don’t push your heel down as some trainers might tell you. Just feel the support of the stirrup and let your weight sink down into your heel. Think it down. But do nothing active!",

Rotating our pelvis forwards pushes our seatbones backwards and this has a holding effect on the horse. It makes it more difficult for him to work through us.

Indeed, if the rider is correctly balanced, and has developed a true, independent seat, then riding can act positively upon the spinal joints.  Most adults will experience an episode of back pain at some point in their life, and back pain is the most common reason for a GP visit. It may be the activities of stable management and the additional strain on the lower back that is more responsible for the high incidence of back pain. Disc related back pain is also more common in the younger and middle aged adult.  Back pain must be treated and managed well to avoid the onset of a chronic problem. Individuals must also be more responsible for managing their own symptoms long term, and not rely so much on the medical approach for a quick fix for their problems.

Most adults will experience an episode of back pain at some point in their life, and back pain is the most common reason for a GP visit. It may be the activities of stable management and the additional strain on the lower back that is more responsible for the high incidence of back pain. Disc related back pain is also more common in the younger and middle aged adult.  Back pain must be treated and managed well to avoid the onset of a chronic problem. Individuals must also be more responsible for managing their own symptoms long term, and not rely so much on the medical approach for a quick fix for their problems.

Many of us walk around with minor aches and pains, and do not exercise or stretch as much as we should. We push ourselves both physically and mentally and do not rest adequately. All this leads to an imbalance in our structure and the function of our body, which generally results in pain and stiffness. So whether you are an athlete or a house-wife; twenty years old or sixty, Osteopathy can help you keep your body performing to the best of its ability.",

He advocates riding a diagonal and then letting the horse make as many strides as possible and gradually building this up.

It is possible to soften the effect with an elastic curb chain or rubber covers.  For the rider, the two reins give more options for finer control. I can ride on the snaffle rein alone, or the curb alone, or both reins. It is an opportunity for some good practice before moving on to a double bridle.

It is possible to soften the effect with an elastic curb chain or rubber covers.  For the rider, the two reins give more options for finer control. I can ride on the snaffle rein alone, or the curb alone, or both reins. It is an opportunity for some good practice before moving on to a double bridle.

Walk-halt-walk transitions. Sometimes with rein-back. Frequent changes of direction.

The less relaxed the more braced and stiff I became. The more braced the less the horse could work through me and the more blocked he became. Despite this he was forwards. But the forwardsness was blocked leading to short steps and falling on the shoulders. This in turn led to a leaning on the rein. This made me feel frustrated and become even more demanding! A vicious circle if ever there was one. I tried giving the rein but it didn’t work. I tried slowing the speed but it didn’t work. The analysis I did in the evening helped me to understand why…",

I tried him several times, including out for a hack in the woods when the owner was bucked off her other mount and broke her finger. J did nothing. The owner assured me he would be perfect for a novice aspiring dressage rider such as me. More than that she said she would help me if I had problems with him (and I believed her). The vet gave him a clean vet’s certificate. My riding instructor rode him and said if I didn’t buy him she would. The owner gave me a written warranty for soundness and temperament.",

The difference between the rider and the horse is that the horse is not a volunteer. As a result we owe it to him to constantly strive to improve our skills and “connection” with him if his welfare is to be uppermost in our hearts and minds, which should be the case for all good horsemen.\n \nAll too often good horsemanship is sadly measured by how many competitions have been won or difficult horses conquered, when in reality it should be measured by a state of peaceful agreement and co-operation between horse and rider - in other words HARMONY.\n \nGood harmony can only be achieved by understanding oneself first and then the horse, along with a sound grasp of technical skills. When the rider is truly aware of this and is committed to constantly strive to improve, only then can he or she reap the rewards this lifelong journey will bring.\n \nI know that by reading this book your own and your individual horse’s journey can only be enhanced.\n \n \nPatrick Print FBHS\nChairman\nThe British Horse Society\nJuly 2007",

The difference between the rider and the horse is that the horse is not a volunteer. As a result we owe it to him to constantly strive to improve our skills and “connection” with him if his welfare is to be uppermost in our hearts and minds, which should be the case for all good horsemen.\n \nAll too often good horsemanship is sadly measured by how many competitions have been won or difficult horses conquered, when in reality it should be measured by a state of peaceful agreement and co-operation between horse and rider - in other words HARMONY.\n \nGood harmony can only be achieved by understanding oneself first and then the horse, along with a sound grasp of technical skills. When the rider is truly aware of this and is committed to constantly strive to improve, only then can he or she reap the rewards this lifelong journey will bring.\n \nI know that by reading this book your own and your individual horse’s journey can only be enhanced.\n \n \nPatrick Print FBHS\nChairman\nThe British Horse Society\nJuly 2007",

The thing about Nuno Oliveira was that he rode with a definite contact even though it was very light…, I believe that to teach this it is necessary to first get the rider to have a normal contact going with the movement of the horse’s mouth. To start with a lighter contact than this is more difficult for most riders. This type of contact is also only possible with an ability to use very small aids and with a horse that is between the aids and through the back.

The thing about Nuno Oliveira was that he rode with a definite contact even though it was very light…, I believe that to teach this it is necessary to first get the rider to have a normal contact going with the movement of the horse’s mouth. To start with a lighter contact than this is more difficult for most riders. This type of contact is also only possible with an ability to use very small aids and with a horse that is between the aids and through the back. Regarding the dressage test I believe the rules demand a ‘normal’ rein contact therefore this is what is required during the test.",

For jumping 105-115 degrees (but if you are short and the horse is big, it may help to ride a little longer). William says, “the wider a horse is, the shorter the stirrups must be. This is because as the distance between the knees increases, the knee and hip joint have to close to allow the lower leg to be in a vertical line and stay in contact with the horse’s sides.” ",

On a flatter backed horse the rider will naturally carry more weight on her thighs and this will naturally spread the load for the horse over a broader area. On a more slender creature it is even more vital to get the heel under the rider’s centre of gravity as more weight will naturally flow down in to the foot. If this does not happen then the slender horse feels more weight in the riders seat – on the most sensitive section of his back! Ouch! I have noticed that slender horses tend to be more sensitive than their wider counterparts. Perhaps this is part of the reason why? And also why beginners are better on cobs? A more experienced rider can achieve more with the slender sensitive horse as her ability to hold her weight off her thighs gives more aid alternatives.",

Is it a good thing for the horse? I think that many dressage riders think “I do dressage now so I lengthen my stirrups”.  What matters most in dressage is balance not stirrup length. We should set our stirrups to a length where we feel we are balanced. Longer is not necessarily better!",

For jumping 105-115 degrees (but if you are short and the horse is big, it may help to ride a little longer). William says, “the wider a horse is, the shorter the stirrups must be. This is because as the distance between the knees increases, the knee and hip joint have to close to allow the lower leg to be in a vertical line and stay in contact with the horse’s sides.” ",

On a flatter backed horse the rider will naturally carry more weight on her thighs and this will naturally spread the load for the horse over a broader area. On a more slender creature it is even more vital to get the heel under the rider’s centre of gravity as more weight will naturally flow down in to the foot. If this does not happen then the slender horse feels more weight in the riders seat – on the most sensitive section of his back! Ouch! I have noticed that slender horses tend to be more sensitive than their wider counterparts. Perhaps this is part of the reason why? And also why beginners are better on cobs? A more experienced rider can achieve more with the slender sensitive horse as her ability to hold her weight off her thighs gives more aid alternatives.",

Is it a good thing for the horse? I think that many dressage riders think “I do dressage now so I lengthen my stirrups”.  What matters most in dressage is balance not stirrup length. We should set our stirrups to a length where we feel we are balanced. Longer is not necessarily better!",

This can be minimised by never lunging in the same place but some damage is still inevitable. A fenced circular lunge ring defines the limit of the circle and therefore acts as an ‘outside aid’. However, it is difficult in a lunge ring to create straight lines or to move the circle. My preference is to lunge in an arena. In that way it is possible to use an end of the arena for control (only one open side), or to move the circle to the centre (completely open) when I have the horse’s attention.",

They all have different advantages and disadvantages. Other than maintaining concentration, the main problem with using a field is the damage to the surface that lunging creates. This can be minimised by never lunging in the same place but some damage is still inevitable. A fenced circular lunge ring defines the limit of the circle and therefore acts as an ‘outside aid’. However, it is difficult in a lunge ring to create straight lines or to move the circle. My preference is to lunge in an arena. In that way it is possible to use an end of the arena for control (only one open side), or to move the circle to the centre (completely open) when I have the horse’s attention.",

Lightness can also refer to the weight the rider feels in the rein. We have already discussed this form of lightness in chapter 4. Lightness may also be used to describe the horse’s way of going. The quality of the steps can be light, elastic, cadenced and soft; like a ballerina. They can also be heavy, dragging like an elephant. Balance and poise go hand in hand with this form of lightness.",

We have also mentioned the rider’s impact through training, fittening and feeding. An effective rider trains her horse to become responsive to smaller requests. If she is unable to do this she has to resort to force and physical strength. The more the rider uses force the more tense the horse will be, the less able he will be to move freely forwards and so the harder the rider will have to work. Good riding appears effortless for horse and rider because it is effortless. You do have a choice.",
