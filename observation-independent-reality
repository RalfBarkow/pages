A metaphysical realism is a cognitive performance which shows itself adapted to an early intimating machine or device intelligence. Among these I include the disciplined and reflective study of pumps, hydraulic apparatus, cranes, pulleys, gears, levers, catapults, and also telescopes microscopes and inventions of all kinds such as compasses, clocks, motors, and so on. A machine and device intelligence had spanned a whole paradigm of scientificity that was needed to wash the religious implications out of a metaphysics without abandoning a metaphysics nonetheless."

These needs referred to seductive strategies of impressing, with which it was supposed to be shown that the marvels of technology could be explained in a completely natural way, i.e. that they obeyed natural law processes as objective facts, for the knowledge of which the assumption of an observation-dependent access to reality was not needed. Because: the whole questionabilities and errors, which result from the assumption of observation-independent facts, always only refer back to the occupation with methods, with which always one tried to deceive the observer, because one suspected him of the unconditional corruptness. So, if it should turn out that the results of an experimental set-up could not possibly be correct, the instruction for the deception of the observer was: Investigate your method of investigation, respectively investigate the method of investigation of the others and show yourself skeptical concerning their results. Doubts, skepticism and questionableness thus did not lead to the rejection of a learned use of methods, but to the reproduction of their persuasiveness, which succeeded only as long as one always cut the observer out of the calculation."

It was enough that noticed knowledge deficits could be postponed sufficiently often into the future and could be actually eliminated later. For the formation of a hope for progress, even for its hardening to an ideology of progress, the exceptional case was completely sufficient."
