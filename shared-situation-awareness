There is now substantial literature built up around this area(see Section 2 for a brief outline). For multi-user systems, Shared Situation Awareness (SSA) refers roughly to how well operators understand the state of other operators, and in particular how the individual’s actions affect their team-mates’ actions, so that operators can work together to achieve team goals [21, 24]. However, there are many different definitions of SSA in the literature and few methodologies for how to measure and analyse it beyond Human-In-the-Loop (HIL) experiments."
