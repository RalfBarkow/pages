      "text": "Vector graphics are specified essentially as the path a pen is to follow over a piece of paper, to produce a drawing. The pen, the paper and the path are thought of as continuous. But computer displays are discrete, comprised of distinct elements or pixels. Because of this, in order to be shown on a computer, vector graphics need to be converted to pixel color values, a process called rasterization. -- Juan Vuletich, Prefiltering Antialiasing for General Vector Graphics, 2013, https://doi.org/10.13140/2.1.2309.3767."
