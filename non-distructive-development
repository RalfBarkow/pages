One thing stood out: when King George came out (the main villain), his style was different, his song was more like 1980s pop music. It seemed to me there was a subtext, that the hiphop style of the rest of the musical was a \"rebellion\" against the 80s pop style of King George. To me that seems like a pattern, in that it's an invitation to compare one kind of \"rebellion\" to another."

It seemed to me there was a subtext, that the hiphop style of the rest of the musical was a \"rebellion\" against the 80s pop style of King George. To me that seems like a pattern, in that it's an invitation to compare one kind of \"rebellion\" to another."
