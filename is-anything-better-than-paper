It has a few pockets for holding some credit cards or business cards, and a spare set of batteries fits in the spine. And best of all, it has a nice, convenient penholder and pad of paper that fit right in along with the [[Palm Pilot]].",

Some folks get really good at it, and can do stuff as quickly as they could write with pen and paper. But even so, it's still not so quick'n'easy to do special symbols, much less write vertically or diagonally. I received a nifty gift this year for use with my [[Palm Pilot]]. It's a nice leather carrying case that is 4\"x5\" and zips open and shut like a book while fitting the [[Palm Pilot]] in fairly snug without the need for velcro. It has a few pockets for holding some credit cards or business cards, and a spare set of batteries fits in the spine.

The most consistent conclusion I came to over and over was simply this - technology itself too often becomes a deterrent to actually getting many things done with relation to groups. I found that taking my laptop or Newton to meetings detracted from the group focus of getting work done in these settings even though I found dramatic efficiencies for myself. Until technologies become so common place that they don't draw unnecessary attention to themselves, they are often unusable in public environments. This \"detractor\" element has lessened with time, but still holds true even today with all the gizmos and gadgets available and used by more and more people. I wouldn't and don't go anywhere without my Newton or something similar. -- Bob O'Brien",
