However, Philadelphia Experiment showed that one cannot escape E=mc2 on the basis that you are bending light.

This is the atom that decays carbon into everything, and giving us the measure of (radiocarbondating), giving approximate age.

            "text": "\nThe assumption that there is some kind of reaction going on between particles in (Subspace) still doesn't account for automatic inverse spin of an equal particle, or quantum mechanics. While string theory depicts that classic and quantum theory are tied together, it doesn't explain wormholes or the einsteinpinskirosebridge (Multiverse theory). I think that Einstein made a mistake in leaving out the \"luminiferous ether\" from his equation. Furthermore, it is ludicrous to think that lightspeed is a limit. You wouldn't know if there was something faster than light because to physically see it, would require that you were traveling just as fast. I have thought about this, and come to one conclusion. It is not that time is merely the distance between cause and effect. It in essence is the very thing that stabilizes the universe, giving everything a specific time to manifest. However, Philadelphia Experiment showed that one cannot escape E=mc2 on the basis that you are bending light. Now there are constant bombardments of cosmic rays, and neutrinos that rain on us all the time. One such atom is known as carbon 14. This is the atom that decays carbon into everything, and giving us the measure of (radiocarbondating), giving approximate age. If that is true then if one were to alter the flow of those atoms, then theoretically one could alter space/time. Not that you are bending light, no you are merely changing the flow of those atoms so that you could actually lessen the time from A to B.",

The Michelson-Morely experiments in the 1880s showed that the ether could not be detected from the differential in the speed of light based on the direction of motion - in fact, those experiments and those confiming them showed <i>no</i> change in the speed of light dependent on the motion of the earth through space. Most contemporary physicists such as Lorentz and Fitzgerald tried - and failed - to explain this discrepancy by positing contraction in the direction of acceleration, because they 'knew' light had to have a medium to propagate through. Einstein, on the other hand, followed Occam's Razor and worked out what the implications would be if it wasn't there - which turned out to give the right answers. From all accounts, he was as surprised by this as anyone. -- [[Jay Osako]]",
