Often the answer becomes more leg, but this just increases the speed and the horse becomes more and more unbalanced and leans on the hand. It is a bit like a child running down hill faster and faster - more and more unbalanced - and a lot of tears at the bottom. To engage the hind leg we often need to slow the trot and give with the hand. Whenever he dives onto the hand and quickens, slow him again and give with the hand (a long-as-needs-be half halt). You will really need to support him with your body and particularly the strong spring in your lower back.",
