It is clear that the WWW would not function without a complex technology and that the functioning of this technology has an infrastructural determinant effect on what is then possible as communication, but it should be equally clear that we are not talking about technology here, but about communication. That is, if you like, our genuine sociological right to conceive of something as communication or as a social system.
