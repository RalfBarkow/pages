For example, children get infected with the two serotypes of polio that exist, even if they are vaccinated. That the SARS-COV-2 vaccines prevent infection is a bonus that will decline over time. However, the vaccines are still great at preventing hospitalization and death. That&apos;s because the protection of the immune system goes beyond antibodies. For example, people who cannot produce antibodies and are vaccinated have similar levels of protection against hospitalization and death as people with a normal immune system."
