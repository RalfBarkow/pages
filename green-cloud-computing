The novel indicators provide information on the environmental effects of cloud services in relation to their service units. For this purpose, the environmental effort for the production of information technology and the operation of data centres is recorded in the four impact categories of abiotic resource depletion potential (ADP), global warming potential (GWP), cumulative energy demand (CED)  and water consumption and assigned to the cloud services. On this basis, four effort metrics are calculated per service unit, for example the carbon footprint or the raw material consumption per service unit. The GCC methodology was applied exemplarily for the four cloud services online storage, virtual desktop infrastructure, video streaming, and videoconferencing, showing the different possibilities for allocating hardware resources to the cloud services. The application examples show that the GCC methodology is well suited for naming and communicating environmental impacts of different cloud services. In addition, sub-studies on developments in the semiconductor industry, on life cycle assessments of ICT components, on critical metals, on the development of energy and resource requirements of data centres as well as on the energy demand of telecommunication networks were carried out as part of the project. These contribute to classifying the KPI system in the current technical developments."
