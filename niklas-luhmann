This attention began with the famous lecture given by the lateral entrant to university life – Luhmann came from a family of brewers in Lüneburg and was initially an administrative lawyer – who questioned three central premises of the Frankfurt neo-Marxism that dominated the discipline at the 1968 Sociology Conference."

The effect converged with Luhmann's forms of self-presentation, which were perhaps meant ironically but were taken quite seriously by antagonists and supporters alike, who referred, for example, to the possible combinations of a  [[Zettelkasten]] and not to his own consciousness as the energy center of his intellectual productivity."

Intellectual Germany followed his essays and books like the chapters of a serialized novel and developed sympathy for the serene author of their elegant prose. Luhmann's death brought the process to an abrupt end. The predicted international reception failed to materialize. It goes without saying that the productivity of the Zettelkasten, which had risen to mythical status, did not outlive its owner. And even the Wikipedia reference to Luhmann as a \"classic of sociology\" now seems like an echo from the distant academic past."

Rather, a look back at the time of his singular fascination shows what power the beauty of thought can unfold, beauty according to Immanuel Kant as the impression of \"purposefulness without purpose.\" It was precisely in this sense that Luhmann's thinking triggered hopes of practical relevance, which he himself had little interest in. From the perspective of aesthetic appreciation, he is certainly one of the great thinkers of the German tradition – like Hegel or Marx, without whose counter-impulses he might have remained an administrative lawyer."

In both, he proves himself to be a sociologist par excellence – a science without distance would be condemned to first-order observations, to simple statements, it would stick to its subject, it would never have questions, would never be worried, never critical. It would be know-it-all and dogmatic, but it would not be sociology."

There is not the slightest hint of a need for affirmation or affiliation, nor any speculation of sympathy or closeness. Luhmann even warns against any hope of warming aspects of sociality, because it could serve as a pretext for confidences and discourage their rejection – and because it could lead to an ideologization of the internal view, to alienation aversion and xenophobia, to anxious vanity of habitual inferiority."

The anachronistic drama of the \"restriction of degrees of freedom\" fixated on belonging and origin seems to attract an ever wider audience, while the \"symphony of intransparency\" is perceived and discredited as unpalatable noise. On this crucial issue, Luhmann teaches aural education, through a single unspectacular instrument, a single elegant stylistic device: through abstraction, the objective sister of social distance. It is associated with the horror of incomprehensibility and is reviled as a gesture of arrogance; but it dissolves all narrowness. What, if not that, is contemporary?"

It was a condition for coping with double contingency. It was the only way to master the complexity \"that comes into the world with the existence of a free alter ego\". The ability to learn is the preferred side in one of Luhmann's most original distinctions, that of normative and cognitive expectations, which Luhmann read in the meaning of a primacy of cognitive, learning expectations in world-social modernity."

And interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity, the most important guarantors of modern science's ability to learn, were daily practice for him, while at the same time being aware and insisting that these learning processes were always about variations in sociology."

During the war in Yugoslavia, he dismissed the audience of his lecture with the wish that they would find a quiet place from which to observe events in the world. Shortly after reunification, he recommended in a feature article that Bebra, as a railroad hub (freight transport) in the middle of Germany, should become the new capital.

His last book is the prelude to a further phase in the development of a theory that we urgently need today. It began in the 1960s with Edmund Husserl's interest in reducing complexity through self-reference, a self-reference, incidentally, that did not imply withdrawal but responsibility. This was followed in the 1970s by Talcott Parsons' interest in the functional equivalence, i.e. interchangeability, of structures, and in the 1980s by Humberto Maturana and Heinz von Foerster's interest in the limited structural coupling of closed systems to their environment."

Now the two-sided form of differentiation moves to the center of the theoretical architecture. How does the control of an intransparency that self-referential systems generate work in order to be able to control them? Paradox is still the most reliable guide. Society does not consist of self-contained elements, be they people, actions or communication. It is restless, incomplete and unreliable."

Luhmann would presumably have held on to his card index, which works analogously with multivalent distinctions. Will we one day have an intelligence that can hold a candle to Luhmann's work with and in his card index?"

He could do this in parallel with Luhmann's SOCIOLOGY OF LOVE. Luhmann objected that the seminar was now called LOVE AS PASSION. AN EXERCISE. All the better, Adorno replied, then his and Luhmann's work could be published together and thus - in a counter-movement to the student zeitgeist, namely concentrating on the essentials, as an example of GREAT COOPERATION, so to speak - present a double semester result, set a public example."

Luhmann advised the offer of an apanage, a generous financial endowment for the friend. Then, after a period of friendship, the former intimacy could be sought again. The apanage should not be presented in a relationship of performance and consideration, but as an expression of loyalty that sets generosity against insult and also demands loyalty from the other side."

Intellectual Germany followed his essays and books like the chapters of a serialized novel and developed sympathy for the serene author of their elegant prose. Luhmann's death brought the process to an abrupt end. The predicted international reception failed to materialize. It goes without saying that the productivity of the Zettelkasten, which had risen to mythical status, did not outlive its owner. And even the Wikipedia reference to Luhmann as a \"classic of sociology\" now seems like an echo from the distant academic past."

Rather, a look back at the time of his singular fascination shows what power the beauty of thought can unfold, beauty according to Immanuel Kant as the impression of \"purposefulness without purpose.\" It was precisely in this sense that Luhmann's thinking triggered hopes of practical relevance, which he himself had little interest in. From the perspective of aesthetic appreciation, he is certainly one of the great thinkers of the German tradition – like Hegel or Marx, without whose counter-impulses he might have remained an administrative lawyer."

The anachronistic drama of the \"restriction of degrees of freedom\" fixated on belonging and origin seems to attract an ever wider audience, while the \"symphony of intransparency\" is perceived and discredited as unpalatable noise. On this crucial issue, Luhmann teaches aural education, through a single unspectacular instrument, a single elegant stylistic device: through abstraction, the objective sister of social distance. It is associated with the horror of incomprehensibility and is reviled as a gesture of arrogance; but it dissolves all narrowness. What, if not that, is contemporary?"

Shortly after reunification, he recommended in a feature article that Bebra, as a railroad hub (freight transport) in the middle of Germany, should become the new capital.

His last book is the prelude to a further phase in the development of a theory that we urgently need today. It began in the 1960s with Edmund Husserl's interest in reducing complexity through self-reference, a self-reference, incidentally, that did not imply withdrawal but responsibility. This was followed in the 1970s by Talcott Parsons' interest in the functional equivalence, i.e. interchangeability, of structures, and in the 1980s by Humberto Maturana and Heinz von Foerster's interest in the limited structural coupling of closed systems to their environment."

How does the control of an intransparency that self-referential systems generate work in order to be able to control them? Paradox is still the most reliable guide. Society does not consist of self-contained elements, be they people, actions or communication. It is restless, incomplete and unreliable."

He could do this in parallel with Luhmann's SOCIOLOGY OF LOVE. Luhmann objected that the seminar was now called LOVE AS PASSION. AN EXERCISE. All the better, Adorno replied, then his and Luhmann's work could be published together and thus - in a counter-movement to the student zeitgeist, namely concentrating on the essentials, as an example of GREAT COOPERATION, so to speak - present a double semester result, set a public example."

Luhmann advised the offer of an apanage, a generous financial endowment for the friend. Then, after a period of friendship, the former intimacy could be sought again. The apanage should not be presented in a relationship of performance and consideration, but as an expression of loyalty that sets generosity against insult and also demands loyalty from the other side."
