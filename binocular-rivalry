As a final illustration, however, consider Hohwy et al.'s (Reference Hohwy, Roepstorff and Friston2008) hierarchical predictive coding model of binocular rivalry. Binocular rivalry (see, e.g., essays in Alais & Blake Reference Alais and Blake2005, and the review article by Leopold & Logothetis Reference Leopold and Logothetis1999) is a striking form of visual experience that occurs when, using a special experimental set-up, each eye is presented (simultaneously) with a different visual stimulus. Thus, the right eye might be presented with an image of a house, while the left receives an image of a face. Under these (extremely – and importantly – artificial) conditions, subjective experience unfolds in a surprising, “bi-stable” manner. Instead of seeing (visually experiencing) a confusing all-points merger of house and face information, subjects report a kind of perceptual alternation between seeing the house and seeing the face. The transitions themselves are not always sharp, and subjects often report a gradual breaking through (see, e.g., Lee et al. Reference Lee, Blake and Heeger2005) of elements of the other image before it dominates the previous one, after which the cycle repeats."

Recall that, on these models, the task of the perceiving brain is to account for (to “explain away”) the incoming or “driving” sensory signal by means of a matching top-down prediction. The better the match, the less prediction error then propagates up the hierarchy. The higher-level guesses are thus acting as priors for the lower-level processing, in the fashion of so-called “empirical Bayes” (such methods use their own target data sets to estimate the prior distribution: a kind of bootstrapping that exploits the statistical independencies that characterize hierarchical models)."
