On the one hand, any given policy issue has its backers and critics who persistently trade their pros and cons in a discursive process which often leads to a *[[dichotomisation]]* (Dascal, 2008) or even *[[polarisation]]* (Sunstein, 2002) of the issue (see also Govier, 2007). In this process, two extreme positions (say, categorical ‘yes’ and categorical ‘no’) dominate the debate, thereby excluding some moderate, mediating positions."

The dynamics of the debate, even if indeed skewed towards two-sided polarisation, is then full of careful diplomacy, strategic building and shifting of alliances, nuanced neither . . . nor . . . arguments, third-way solutions, and so on. In brief, it unfolds in a manner far removed from the dualistic proand-con reconstructions."

      "text": "Vivid illustrations of how pluralistic elements permeate seemingly dichotomised debates can be found in empirical analyses of the [[climate change]] and [[energy policy]] discourse. Some analysts argue that contributions to the climate change debate are best treated as cases of ‘polyphonic argumentation’ (Fløttum and Dahl, 2011: 217), that is, argumentation characterised by ‘a subtle and complex staging of [multiple] voices and positions’ (Dahl and Fløttum, 2014: 404). In such a view, ‘voices and positions become important objects of study in order to understand the complexity of the debate’ (Dahl and Fløttum, 2014: 402), while the crucial goal of the analysis ‘is to explain how the interaction of claims and voices orients discursive argumentation related to the climate phenomenon’ (Fløttum and Dahl, 2011: 206). Overall, the undeniable complexity of the global debate over climate change and energy policies – such as [[shale gas production]] – is increasingly seen as resulting from two basic factors: (1) the subtle management of uncertainty and knowledge claims between the expert and lay communities and (2) the multiplicity of players, positions and places shaping the debate (Aakhus and Lewíski, 2016; Fløttum and Dahl, 2011; Pearce et al., 2015)."

Shale gas is natural gas trapped in deep layers of shale rock, which can be extracted through the method of hydraulic fracturing (or ‘[[fracking]]’). "

      "text": "My–[[Marcin Lewiński]]'s main point is that while the shale gas debate – both in the USA and the EU – is typically framed as simple pro-and-con argumentation (‘Shall we extract shale gas or not?’), it is in fact far more complex. Crucially, various opponents of shale gas production defend their anti-fracking positions using distinct, and often outright contradictory, reasons. I will make it clear by analysing argumentation of the Russian energy company [[Gazprom]] and its relation to the position of the environmental non-governmental organisation (NGO) Greenpeace. Based on this analysis, I will show that the clash of positions and exchange of reasons in the shale gas debate generates a multi-party argumentative discussion – or [[argumentative polylogue]] – that cannot be adequately rendered using the analytic framework of simple pro-and-con dialectics.

The dynamics of the debate, even if indeed skewed towards two-sided polarisation, is then full of careful diplomacy, strategic building and shifting of alliances, nuanced neither . . . nor . . . arguments, third-way solutions, and so on. In brief, it unfolds in a manner far removed from the dualistic proand-con reconstructions."

I will make it clear by analysing argumentation of the Russian energy company Gazprom and its relation to the position of the environmental non-governmental organisation (NGO) Greenpeace. Based on this analysis, I will show that the clash of positions and exchange of reasons in the shale gas debate generates a multi-party argumentative discussion – or argumentative polylogue – that cannot be adequately rendered using the analytic framework of simple pro-and-con dialectics. Argumentative polylogues are discussions which involve many protagonists (and antagonists) of contrary (rather than contradictory) positions."
