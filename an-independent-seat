Rotating our pelvis forwards pushes our seatbones backwards and this has a holding effect on the horse. It makes it more difficult for him to work through us.

If we make ourselves too tall we pull the spring and when held there we have no springiness (elasticity). If we collapse our weight down and draw our legs up the spring is totally compressed – again no springiness! The spring can only work well when it is at its natural length and aligned (not bent). This is what body-workers call “pelvic neutral”.",

As our riding skills improve we can use our pelvis as we would the clutch in a car. Rotating our pelvis back pushes our seatbones forwards and this has a reinforcing (pushing) effect on the horse. Rotating our pelvis forwards pushes our seatbones backwards and this has a holding effect on the horse. It makes it more difficult for him to work through us. We must be careful to keep the energy and never block with the hand when using our pelvis in this way. We can experiment with small changes to our pelvis angle to really understand the power of this tool.",
