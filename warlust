The military significance of a few Swiss weapons is so marginal for the war in Ukraine that he cannot understand why many of his Swiss-German colleagues would soften their basic pacifist stance for this. The only explanation for him, he said, is the proximity of German-speaking Switzerland to Germany. \"Apparently, German criticism of Swiss refusal on the weapons issue has had an effect,\" Fridez believes."
