Curiosity is The Linchpin; it drives learning, both for our learners and for ourselves.\n"

      "text": "A classroom where curiosity is the spark that ignites learning is a joyous place to be – for the learners and for their teachers. The act of learning is joyful, the uncomfortable grapple is propelled by the active pursuit of joy, and the success is more joyful. With an intrinsic desire to know, knowledge acquisition is transformed from ‘work’ to ‘learning’. After all, we work for others; we learn for ourselves.\n"

      "text": "The question of whether one can learn to be more curious is an interesting and multifaceted idea. Being literate and numerate seems insufficient in our ever-changing world. Without curiosity, innovation – a core 21st-century practice – might be limited. If we are to educate learners to thrive in our complex world then illuminating the ways in which curiosity can help us to learn is crucial.\n"

We are learning that drive, incongruity, and information gap theories can be deployed to ignite teaching and learning through specific actions; that understanding the characteristics of curiosity can shift our roles in the classroom; that harnessing the types of curiosity can inspire more authentic learner-centred exploration.\n"

They will be Literate, Numerate and Curious – not one without the others. They will have discovered the power of their Creative Curiosity and how it benefits their learning; and they will be hungry to continue to learn. The Designed inGenuity framework is a powerful tool to nurture the Curious Child.\n"
