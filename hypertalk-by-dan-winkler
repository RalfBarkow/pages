It is a deceptively powerful and extensible language that introduced a lot of people to the basics of programming through a simple English-like syntax, making it easy to learn quickly enough to write off the top of your head, then hack around while you're actually using the result. By being part of a RAD, it also preserves the programmer from having to specify user interface components like buttons and text fields by providing empty components that can be dragged around on a screen. Each component can carry its own HyperTalk instructions (e.g. 'on mouseUp do whatever end mouseUp', but can also be controlled from code elsewhere.",
