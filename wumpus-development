Yob was inspired to make a game that used a non-grid pattern, where the player would move through points connected through some other type of topology.

He then added the bottomless pits, and a couple days later the super bats. Finally, feeling that players would want to create a map, he made the cave map fixed and gave each cave a number. Yob later claimed that, to his knowledge, most players did not create maps of the cave system, nor follow his expected strategy of carefully moving around the system to determine exactly where the Wumpus was before firing an arrow. While playtesting the game, Yob found it unexciting that the Wumpus always stayed in one place, and so changed it to be able to move. He then delivered a copy of the game, written in [[BASIC]], to the PCC- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus#Development wikipedia]"

      "text": "In May 1973, one month after he had finished coding the game, Yob went to a conference at [[Stanford University]] and discovered that in the section of the conference where the PCC had set up computer terminals, multiple players were engrossed in playing ''Wumpus'', making it, in his opinion, a hit game. The PCC first mentioned the game in its newsletter in September 1973 as a \"cave game\" that would be available to order through them soon, and gave it a full two-page description in its next issue in November 1973. Tapes containing ''Wumpus'' were sold via mail order by both the PCC and Yob himself. The PCC description was republished along with [[source code]] in its book ''What to Do After You Hit Return'' in 1977, while a description of the game and its source code was published in ''[[Creative Computing (magazine)]]'' in its October 1975 issue, and republished in ''The Best of Creative Computing'' the following year. It also appeared in other books of BASIC games, such as ''Computer Programs in BASIC'' in 1981.",
