We can, however, make it visible, notice and name it and continue to engage our learners in conversations about who they are and who they could be. The indicators are establishing a sophisticated language for our learners to talk about their self-identity as a learner. Illuminating potential is the first step in empowering it. Being seen and heard authentically has [[Transformative Power]]."
