      "text": "By definition, a finite automaton is reversible if its transition function is invertible. Thus, in order to realize a finite automaton by means of a reversible sequential network, it will be sufficient to take its transition function, construct a reversible realization of it, and use this as the combinational part of the desired sequential network. The problem of reversibly realizing an arbitrary finite function has been solved in Section 4. Thus, we have the following theorem."
