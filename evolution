Thus, it may have made a difference to the development of Talmudic Judaism and its handling of problems of interpretation of sacred texts that the political unity of the Jewish people had been destroyed, and thus no discriminatory political support and stabilization of theological controversies could be expected, as in the case of Islam and Christianity. Thus, the regional and political segmentation of Europe (i.e., the failure of the idea of empire due to the resistance of the church in the 11/12th century) produces an abundance of differential progress in individual regions, which then act like experiments with progress, with which or against which other regions can determine their path toward functional differentiation. Thus, in France there is a nation-state very early on, but an art-theoretical literature does not emerge until after the establishment of the Academie Royale de Peinture et Sculpture (1648) – and both the literature and the academy follow Italian models.

In view of the system bases of all evolution, in view of the indissoluble connection of elementary operations, structure formations and operative closure of the system delimiting itself to the outside, differentiation of the evolutionary functions cannot mean that it would come to a causal separation. What is meant, however, is that the functions of variation, selection and re-stabilization cannot be coordinated by the evolving system, cannot be coordinated with each other; because that would mean that from the beginning only so much is varied as can be seligated as a contribution to the \"system maintenance\". Renunciation of this kind of purposeful coordination means that, seen from the point of view of the system, it is coincidence when variations lead to positive or negative selections, and that it is still coincidence whether and how these selections, which use their own criteria, can be stabilized in the system. By \"chance\" it is then also said that the evolving system is uncontrollably sensitive to the environment at these inner boundaries.

Thus, the introduction of writing gives new possibilities and new problems to the already existing difference of competent and incompetent roles in dealing with sacred things - for example, that of consolidating a tradition held to be sacred. Thus, it may have made a difference to the development of Talmudic Judaism and its handling of problems of interpretation of sacred texts that the political unity of the Jewish people had been destroyed, and thus no discriminatory political support and stabilization of theological controversies could be expected, as in the case of Islam and Christianity. Thus, the regional and political segmentation of Europe (i.e., the failure of the idea of empire due to the resistance of the church in the ii/12th century) produces an abundance of differential progress in individual regions, which then act like experiments with progress, with which or against which other regions can determine their path toward functional differentiation. Thus, in France there is a nation-state very early on, but an art-theoretical literature does not emerge until after the establishment of the Academie Royale de Peinture et Sculpture (1648) - and both the literature and the academy follow Italian models. These considerations also go beyond the classical theoretical distinction between endogenously and exogenously induced evolution, which in any case cannot be maintained in terms of systems theory. It must be replaced by a more complex theory, namely by the hypothesis that an evolving system with differentiation of evolutionary functions will absorb more external influences, react more to historical situations and therefore evolve faster (but always: purely internally).

        "text": "Thus, the introduction of writing gives new possibilities and new problems to the already existing difference of competent and incompetent roles in dealing with sacred things – for example, that of consolidating a tradition held to be sacred. Thus, it may have made a difference to the development of Talmudic Judaism and its handling of problems of interpretation of sacred texts that the political unity of the Jewish people had been destroyed, and thus no discriminatory political support and stabilization of theological controversies could be expected, as in the case of Islam and Christianity. Thus, the regional and political segmentation of Europe (i.e., the failure of the idea of empire due to the resistance of the church in the 11/12th century) produces an abundance of differential progress in individual regions, which then act like experiments with progress, with which or against which other regions can determine their path toward functional differentiation. Thus, in France there is a nation-state very early on, but an art-theoretical literature does not emerge until after the establishment of the Academie Royale de Peinture et Sculpture (1648) – and both the literature and the academy follow Italian models.
