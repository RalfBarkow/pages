For when system formation occurs, it can be assumed that operations of the type necessary for it have always existed, and can set about gradually dismantling the restrictions imposed by an older order – for example, the fragmentation of landlordial and clerical jurisdictions, or the dual monetary systems of the Middle Ages, or serfdom and the aristocratic bondage of landed property."
