The documentary film follows in the footsteps of the well-traveled, explorative artist and shows a life lived to the point of absolute devotion. A powerful portrait of an outsider who becomes a center of attraction."

Plus experimental films that were shown at the Solothurn Film Festival. In order to understand and observe what holds the world and people together in their innermost being, this enterprising man in Swiss peasant's clothing traveled countless kilometers around the world. He set off without any money in his pocket. On his travels, he traded portrait sketches for food and lived with the locals."
