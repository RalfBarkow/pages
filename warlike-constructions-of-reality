      "text": "Although most psychoanalytic authors seem to take greater pleasure in offering explanations rather than describing phenomena, certain patterns can be distilled from the literature that are typically – though not exclusively – observed in the thinking and feeling of people involved in any kind of [[War]]. These are patterns that cannot be attributed to individuals or personalities as fixed, unchangeable characteristics, but rather thinking and feeling abilities that are used depending on the context and therefore change. Thus, serious differences can be observed between the thinking and feeling patterns realized in peacetime and wartime. Those of wartime – and this should be emphasized here – show great similarities to the psychodynamics of psychoses. From the perspective of the non-involved observer, they seem to be associated with a strong loss of reality."
