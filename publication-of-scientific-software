Its necessity is well recognized in principle, but the effort required for such a review is prohibitive. This is the most visible symptom of the problem that is the topic of this essay. More generally, this problem is that digital scientific knowledge is today expressed using notations such as programming languages, which are not suitable for communication between human scientists."

The main audience is computational scientists, who have practical experience with doing science using computers but no formal training in computer science or in scientific epistemology. Readers with a computer science background may skim over much of the second part. Note that I will not propose the solution to the problem, nor even a solution. My goal is to convince computational scientists that there is a problem, and that it can be solved. Finding solutions that work well is likely to require many years and the participation of many people willing to test different ideas in practice."

This includes almost all of physics and chemistry, a good part of biology and the quantitative social sciences, and all domains of applied research that build on foundations in physics and chemistry. Much of what I say **also applies to models based on discrete mathematics, such as graphs or cellular automata**, but I will not consider them for the sake of simplicity. The examples I will use for illustration reflect my own background in computational biophysics, but readers shouldn’t find it difficult to substitute examples from their own field of work."
