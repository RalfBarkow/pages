      "text": "Furthermore, systems theory in its Luhmannian version is blind to the growth and innovation constraints of the monetary economy. Luhmann sees that exchange has been an unintended side-effect of the institutionalization of property, but how wealth enters the world, as a kind of unintended side-effect of money, remains opaque to him.

      "text": "At this point, however – as Paul thinks: to the advantage of systems theory – the property theory or, better perhaps: interest theory can be inserted (chap. 6/1). The point of this theory is not so much that money can only be created on the basis of property, but rather in the insight that money, being property-based, is always interest-bearing. According to Heinsohn and Steiger, all money is a promissory bill covered by property. The creditor vouches with his property, which he may lose, for the bill of exchange in the hands of a debtor, addressed to no one in particular. Such a bill of exchange is potentially money. As compensation, not for the delivery of a good or the creditor's renunciation of consumption – goods are not moved at all, after all – but as compensation for the temporary holding, the temporary non-sale of the creditor's property, the debtor pays an interest. Consequently, the interest is initially only nominal surplus value to be earned by the debtor as well as by inuner. This may be done by trade or, since the possibilities of making a profit by exchange are limited, by increased production. In other words, interest is the hollow form that forces the production of wealth. The interest \"motive\" therefore first of all plausibilizes the autopoiesis of the money economy. It explains why the imbalance not of supply and demand – that would be much too naturalistic – but of value quantities expressed in money is the rule and why payments have to follow payments. This is because it is always a question of repaying debts which, as long as money circulates, cannot be repaid at all in their entirety. "

        "text": "What makes the abstract understanding, the modern and the ancient one, in its individual parts or categories as well as in its totality so puzzling, is the fact that in it any perceptual reality is abstracted, no trace of sense activity is contained, and that an understanding of such a nature can nevertheless serve, indeed is downright indispensable, to investigate perceptible nature, namely to investigate what has general necessity of nature, mathematically definable natural law, in the phenomena that can be experienced. For it is indeed the use of non-empirical abstractions which gives this way of thinking its conceptual form and the specific intellectual character by which it is ~sense-wise divorced from manual labor, but equally essentially superior to it in the range of cognition. Despite all criticism of the >>deficiencies of abstract natural-scientific materialism, which excludes the historical process<<(MEW Vol. 23, p. 393), Marx assigns to this intellect the ability of a >>scientific analysis<< that makes phenomena accessible to us, >>just as the apparent movement of the heavenly bodies is comprehensible only to those who know their real, but sensually imperceptible movement<<(ibid., p. 335)."

Luhmann sees that exchange has been an unintended side-effect of the institutionalization of property, but how wealth enters the world, as a kind of unintended side-effect of money, remains opaque to him. At this point, however - as I think: to the advantage of systems theory - the property theory or, better perhaps: interest theory can be inserted (chap. 6/1). The point of this theory is not so much that money can only be created on the basis of property, but rather in the insight that money, being property-based, is always interest-bearing. According to Heinsolm and Steiger, all money is a promissory bill covered by property. The creditor vouches with his property, which he may lose, for the bill of exchange in the hands of a debtor, addressed to no one in particular. Such a bill of exchange is potentially money. As compensation, not for the delivery of a good or the creditor's renunciation of consumption - goods are not moved at all, after all - but as compensation for the temporary holding, the temporary non-sale of the creditor's property, the debtor pays an interest. Consequently, the interest is initially only nominal surplus value to be earned by the debtor as well as by inuner. This may be done by trade or, since the possibilities of making a profit by exchange are limited, by increased production. In other words, interest is the hollow form that forces the production of wealth. The interest \"motive\" therefore first of all plausibilizes the autopoiesis of the money economy. It explains why the imbalance not of supply and demand - that would be much too naturalistic - but of value quantities expressed in money is the rule and why payments have to follow payments.
