This will be a bad idea later when you get told to add an optimization phase. I like for the parser to produce abstract syntax trees, in which case the code generator is a set of methods you add to the AST classes, or perhaps a Visitor.  (I am often telling people not to use the Visitor pattern, but this is one place where it can actually make things simpler.) It might seem more complex to separate code generation, but it makes the system easier to test (you can test parsing separately from code generation), easier to understand (because classes are smaller and do one thing), and might even reduce code duplication.  And it will make your life easier when they ask for code optimization!  This might seem to be violating YAGNI, but I don't think it is.",
