And this is comprehensible for a viewer who is open enough. And I rejoice in his joy that he has departed from his previous expectation to make this visual experience. For him a new realization. And this is an interruption of the previous, of what was considered possible so far."

As a sociologist, one would perhaps see this as an indicator of differentiation. Art is no longer a special refinement in everyday use, an everyday object, nor merely decoration, but it obviously wants something else. A differentiation is produced. This could be related to the initial difference between objects and world reference."

It is therefore not a Gestalt concept. It is not a question of whether a thing is round or square or brightly colored or dimly colored or large or small. But with form I always mean the production of a difference, thus a borderline. This can of course be a circle or a fast or slow, straight or dashed line. But always with the effect that it distinguishes two sides. And with the consequence that one needs time to cross the borders, thus only with a special mental or factual operation comes to the other side. This is the sense of the concept of form, to pose the questions of time, difference and the unity of a context in a somewhat unconventional way."

In the case of the picture, this is particularly striking. The artist may spend as much time as he likes to set his distinction, at some point the picture is there and one sees it perceptibly in front of him in all its distinctions at the same time. Can one imagine that as an artist that one produces something by a whole series of distinctions and at the same time thinks of the fact that the viewer will see afterwards all that one has made in a long process as simultaneously existing?

You can't just come in from point one and say: now I understand this. A certain training is necessary for that. I understand forms more as a totality. Certainly there is this inner and outer containment, but there is also a three-dimensionality. When I refer to my process, I build up a layer, eventually, and then take that layer itself back to make a correction or a change again. There is a certain sandwitching effect here, a certain layering."

We have to ask ourselves whether this is a model conception that is still adequate, or whether one would not have to instruct the viewer himself in the production sequence of the work of art, would not have to expect him to take the time to go from one to the other and to come to something again and again, I would almost like to say, to find meaning again and again and no empty places or no external references, where he now sees, aha, that costs so and so much - or whatever meaning he would then have to draw in from the outside? So he would have to be able to circle in the picture, to circulate or to find again and again new interpretations in the history, but just not have to see everything at once. "

That one is always in the world, never has the world as an object before oneself, but also cannot be outside of the world. Thus, one definitely sees something definite, nothing nebulous or mysterious is meant. But what does not become visible is precisely the unity of the form or that which constitutes the difference between the one or the other side or the before and the after of an operation. The execution makes something visible and at the same time invisible. With this concept of form one thus arrives at a mediation between object and world. One paints objects in such a way that there is something more in them than just themselves. But that which is more inside is at the same time hidden, one cannot treat it like an object; that is the idea behind it."

And that is on the one hand the observer himself, who can of course objectify himself. But as one knows from philosophy, he succeeds in this only by hiding behind himself again. The world itself, that is the last unit of every used distinction, is again invisible at the moment. One can designate it again, but always only with a new operation, with a new distinction, with new invisibilities. "

So I would answer yes and no. On the one hand, everything that can be seen or said takes place in the world, and they are always, in this sense, statements about the world. But just not about the unity of the world or about that which can never be left.\n\nAnd also not about the whole. In this sense the theory is directed against holographic approaches, as they are offered today in the style of the New Age; somehow a trace of the whole is to be found in everything individual, somehow every element is a part in which the whole is \"inscribed\". The concept of form is explicitly set against such a holographic New Age mysticism. "

The observer is again someone who handles a distinction and does not see himself when he observes.

One wants to see ( what the artist observed when he had decided so and not otherwise, and vice versa the artist wants to steer the observation of the observer. "

Wir müssen uns fragen, ob das eine Modellvorstellung ist, die noch adäquat ist, oder ob man nicht den Betrachter selbst notwendig in die Herstellungssequenz des Kunstwerkes einweisen müßte, auch ihm also die Zeit zumuten müßte, von einem zum anderen zu gehen und dabei immer wieder zu etwas zu kommen, möchte ich beinahe sagen, also immer wieder Sinn zu finden und keine leeren Plätze oder keine externen Referenzen, wo er nun sieht, aha, das kostet so und so viel - oder welche Bedeutung auch immer er dann von außen hereinziehen müsste ? Er müßte also im Bild kreisen, kursieren können oder in der Geschichte immer neue Interpretationen wiederfinden können, aber eben nicht alles auf einmal sehen müssen. "

Sicherlich gibt es diese Innen- und Außeneingrenzung, aber es gibt auch eine Dreidimensionalität.

Es ist also kein Gestaltbegriff. Es geht nicht um die Frage, ob ein Ding rund ist oder viereckig oder grellfarbig oder schwachfarbig oder groß oder klein. Sondern mit Form meine ich immer die Produktion einer Differenz, also einer Grenzlinie. Das kann natürlich ein Kreis sein oder eine schnell oder langsam, gerade oder gestrichelt gezeichnete Linie. Aber immer mit dem Effekt, daß es zwei Seiten unterscheidet. Und mit der Folge, daß man Zeit braucht, um die Grenzen zu überschreiten, also nur mit einer besonderen gedanklichen oder faktischen Operation zur anderen Seite kommt. Das ist der Sinn des Formbegriffs, die Fragen nach Zeit, Differenz und der Einheit eines Zusammenhanges in etwas unkonventioneller Art zu stellen."

Und dies ist für einen Betrachter nachvollziehbar, der offen genug ist. Und ich freue mich an seiner Freude, daß er von seiner bisherigen Erwartung abgekommen ist, um diese Seherfahrung zu machen. Für ihn eine neue Erkenntnis. Und das ist eine Unterbrechung des bisherigen, dessen, was bisher für möglich gehalten wurde."

So I would answer yes and no. On the one hand, everything that can be seen or said takes place in the world, and they are always, in this sense, statements about the world. But just not about the unity of the world or about that which can never be left.\n\nAnd also not about the whole. In this sense the theory is directed against holographic approaches, as they are offered today in the style of the New Age; somehow a trace of the whole is to be found in everything individual, somehow every element is a part in which the whole is \"inscribed\". The concept of form is explicitly set against such a holographic New Age mysticism. "
