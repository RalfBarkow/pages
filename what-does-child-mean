The variability of meaning of what is explicitly and implicitly understood by \"child\" can be demonstrated historically. And however controversial the details may be and however unclear it may remain since when children have existed: it is obvious that this semantics is needed for pedagogical purposes and thus correlates with the differentiation of education – first as a role specificity (as a simple societas) in the already complex domestic societas, then as school education. With the view that the child is the medium of education, a systematic theory is supplied for such investigations."

Only an observer of the observers who use the distinction child/adult, only an observer of the pedagogues notices that the child stands in the pivot of two distinctions. It is distinguished from the adult and from the organic-psychic systems, which are only called child (in contrast to the adult). Only in second-order cybernetics, only in the cybernetics of observing systems, it can be clarified that the child serves as a [[Medium for Education]]."

In the organic as well as in the mental sense, such systems are state-determined systems. That means: they continue their own operations starting from the state they are in, whereby this state is the result of their own previous operations. And they are structure-determined systems in the sense that they need structures for the continuation from operation to operation, which limit the range of connection possibilities, so that an observer can distinguish and designate their unity by describing their structures (here for example: attitudes, habits, character traits)."

Of course, communication, although autopoietically organized in its own sequence, is not possible without consciousness. Consciousness can operate without participation in communication and can even structure its own thought sequences linguistically; but it cannot come into being (or only in a very rudimentary form) if it has never participated in linguistic communication. Using a term of Humberto Maturana, such a connection can be called structural coupling. Structural couplings presuppose a continuum of materiality of a physical kind that supports them and makes common seeing and hearing possible. Their basis thus lies in another medium that enables the autopoiesis of communication and of consciousness without interfering with them in a determinative way. Structural couplings are therefore compatible with the autopoiesis of the coupled systems, which is an essential feature of the concept. They also do not enter the continuation of autopoiesis as a structural moment and thus as an operative requirement. On the screen of the involved systems, they become recognizable only as irritation, and as irritation that co-determines what happens on it."

Irritation is, in other words, not something that is already present in the environment and can then be transferred into the system. The transformation of structural couplings (here: of communication and consciousness) into irritations thus links a system/environment connection, which only an observer can see, with states of its own, to which the system can react autopoietically and, with more or less consequences, must react. Structural coupling gives impetus to a kind of permanent irritation of the systems; and if it repeats itself with a certain permanence and affects the system with a certain typicality (for instance as language), it can be assumed that it triggers structural developments in the system which an observer can recognize as directed, at least as not accidental. The key to the problem of socialization lies in the permanent irritations that occur in consciousness when it participates in communication again and again and in repeatable forms (language). It can be explained in this way (1) that all socialization is self-socialization, i.e. it cannot come about in the form of a transference; that it (2) produces a variety of systemic forms far beyond the triggering conditions, for example in a family very different children despite similar conditions; that it (3) nevertheless leads in a non-random direction, which makes it possible that people can adjust to each other in spite of self-referential closure, in spite of mutual intransparency and in spite of high structural difference; and that (4) the participation in linguistic communication with its distinctive, fascinating world of forms is the key experience for this – whatever the individual consciousness thinks of it.

For this, in more complex societies, certain improbability thresholds have to be overcome, and for this, only for this, the medium child serves in the case of education. If this is so, it will hardly be possible to avoid that the so-called child reacts to the fact that it is treated as such. One should know more about what happens in the consciousness when it registers that it is treated as a child (or at any rate: differently from adults); that is, whether and how the permissions and prohibitions, freedom concessions and notions of being able, not able, not yet able, not yet having to but still being able, lying in the context of this semantics, have an effect on structural changes of this system. It would be naïve to assume that these effects will automatically meet the pedagogical intention. For even when a consciousness learns to describe itself as a child and to take over the childlike part in communication, what then happens to the structures of the autopoiesis of consciousness is something completely different from what is thereby made possible or facilitated as communication."

The child is medium only in the sense that a sufficiently loose coupling of his thoughts and ideas can be assumed, which are then available for accesses, for form-strict couplings, especially for \"knowledge\". \"Black box\" means only that it is not possible to see through and to control how what is identified in this way functions internally. There is, in other words, no \"[[Requisite Variety]]\" towards it, and a fortiori no other mental system and no social system can establish a one-to-one relation of its elements to those of the black box, because that would mean to merge the systems into a single system.

If one wants to know how the apparent arbitrariness of the construction is reduced, one has to observe the observer and not what he observes. The child is not a chemical, not a biological, not a psychological medium, it is not a carbon, not a protein, not an attention. It is a medium only in the system of education and the changes in the conception of this medium are therefore explained by the differentiation of a social functional system for education.

Here, the attribution forms acting and experiencing are available depending on whether a behavior appearing on the outside of the black box is attributed to this system itself or to its environment. For the medium [[Child]] it is significant that as an educator one has to choose the attribution form experience, even and especially when the child obviously acts according to everybody's opinion and according to his own opinion. The extravagance (and artificiality) of the medium of education thus shows itself in the fact that an initially obvious attributional addressing is abandoned or bracketed and replaced by the question: how does the child experience when he behaves in a certain way? This is not least a suspension of the normal moral sanction mechanism and the creation of a free space for educationally specific sanctions, which can then lead to the formation of a selection medium on the basis of the difference of better or worse performance. Like all function-specific media, this too presupposes distance from morality; and the excuse here is that the child is \"not yet\" fully responsible for its actions (unlike adults!)."

At the same time, this meets the need to seek out opportunities for influence and not to educate in a way that the child can neither absorb nor understand. But while this insight also appears in older educational teachings and is certainly as old as the reflection on education per se, the differentiation of the educational system and the reflection accompanying it stimulates a perspective à la \"[[Second Order Cybernetics]]\": an observation of the child as observer and a corresponding restraint of attributions of action. The problem of education will be not to set action against action, but to choose action according to the experience of the other. And while in the case of love, Ego's action should be chosen in such a way that it confirms the experience of Alters, in the case of education it must aim not at confirmation but at correction."

Everything learned has to be revised in further learning.

Here, knowledge is to designate in general the structure with the help of which mental systems can continue their autopoiesis, i.e. can find, connect, actualize next thoughts starting from their respective current state.

Thus, there are no stocks of knowledge, and memory is not to be understood as \"memory\", but as a consistency check newly updated from moment to moment. (Therefore, we do not need to know that we know and how we know and since when we know that a door is to be opened with the door handle. The situation is usually redundant enough, that is: we find enough clues for an operational consistency check). Only an observer (but this can also be the operating system itself) can introduce knowledge in the time scheme, i.e. ask and, if necessary, determine whether one, why one, how long one has known something certain. And only an observer can form ideas about the further use of knowledge in future cases – but also he does this only in the moment by doing this, thus only in the consummation of his own autopoiesis. Thus, if teachers assume that the knowledge they impart to their students will be useful in their future, this is their (all too understandable) observer knowledge; and they do not know it when they are busy with something else, such as digging their garden in the afternoon.

Knowledge, viewed in this way, is the contraction of the medium to specific, tightly coupled forms, and it is assumed that the children being educated can handle it (or at least should learn to do so) whenever it comes into consideration. Therefore, knowledge is largely imagined as a transformation function that can be called up in situations, with the consequence that whenever there is an occasion for actualization, this knowledge will be used appropriately and correctly. This means nothing else than that children are to be brought to be trivial machines, which they cannot be and cannot become.

Writing opens up a space of possibilities that can no longer be exhausted by any individual and that remains stable even if the contents change; not the heaven of heavens, but the form of the forms that serve as culture. Writing \"potentializes\" culture by preserving even what is not written as something that could be written if needed.

In the classroom, on the other hand, it is important that only true knowledge is taught and learned (but this, too, functions as a communicative operation in exactly the same way and just as well when it is a matter of untrue knowledge). Operations are always indifferent to the fact whether an observer calls the meant sense true or untrue by means of the special distinction true/untrue. And one must say: Fortunately! Because in the other case the scheme true/untrue would stop the autopoiesis of the operating system at the next opportunity, namely at an \"untrue\" operation for lack of connectivity and the system would cease to exist.

The resulting reformulated pedagogy is no longer measured only in terms of getting the material into the children's heads, but in terms of developing the ability to learn. The \"cram school\" falls into disrepute. The school is now in demand as an educational institution. Accordingly, natural education, which accompanies the aging process, is now recommended only for an initial phase in which children are still children. And this is followed by the phase of school attendance and study, in which education is promoted in the sense of the earliest possible independence in dealing with reading."

      "text": "The caesura of reading and self-learning skills revolutionizes the semantics of childhood. It not only determines what happens in school or university with sufficiently developed competencies. In a kind of backward projection, it is also applied to early childhood education. Here, too, it is now no longer simply a matter of dressage, but of learning in an educative (may one say educagenic?) milieu. The total medium of the child is transformed. The medium of the child, as we know it today, is a result of printing and thus also a genuinely social medium."

Parsons calls this \"circulation\" with a daring metaphor. Thus, by using power in the form of collectively binding decisions, the ruler makes himself visible and, by enforcing decisions, holds out the prospect of other, equally enforceable decisions. Thus, money does not consume itself by being spent for certain purposes in certain amounts (i.e., taking shape), but renews its medial potency in the payment process itself. Thus, truth gains as well as untruth gains are particularly valued in modern science if they give rise to further research questions, and where this is not the case, truth or untruth quickly becomes uninteresting. And in the case of education?\n\n"

This is obviously true for the case of an education canonized at the reading material, where it is sufficient in the [[Educational System]] to bring the children into the form determined thereby. But even if one opens up the concept of education with Klafki for historically current, i.e. changing social problems, this does not clarify how the medium can regenerate itself despite the formation of form. The impetus for changes in form, i.e. changes in educational content and teaching topics, is expected from the social environment of the educational system. This is a contribution to the explanation of the dynamics of the system that should not be underestimated (if we disregard the fact that it is formulated in value terms in the context of education). The side glance at other media such as power, money and truth, which can themselves provide for their regeneration, i.e. trigger a momentum of the system, however, raises the question whether the medium of the educational system does not also have corresponding possibilities."

Of course, communication, although autopoietically organized in its own sequence, is not possible without consciousness. Consciousness can operate without participation in communication and can even structure its own thought sequences linguistically; but it cannot come into being (or only in a very rudimentary form) if it has never participated in linguistic communication. Using a term of Humberto Maturana, such a connection can be called structural coupling. Structural couplings presuppose a continuum of materiality of a physical kind that supports them and makes common seeing and hearing possible. Their basis thus lies in another medium that enables the autopoiesis of communication and of consciousness without interfering with them in a determinative way. Structural couplings are therefore compatible with the autopoiesis of the coupled systems, which is an essential feature of the concept. They also do not enter the continuation of autopoiesis as a structural moment and thus as an operative requirement.

        "text": "Socialization in this complex sense depends on keeping linguistic communication going. For this, in more complex societies, certain improbability thresholds have to be overcome, and for this, only for this, the medium child serves in the case of education. If this is so, it will hardly be possible to avoid that the so-called child reacts to the fact that it is treated as such. One should know more about what happens in the consciousness when it registers that it is treated as a child (or at any rate: differently from adults); that is, whether and how the permissions and prohibitions, freedom concessions and notions of being able, not able, not yet able, not yet having to but still being able, lying in the context of this semantics, have an effect on structural changes of this system. It would be naïve to assume that these effects will automatically meet the pedagogical intention. For even when a consciousness learns to describe itself as a child and to take over the childlike part in communication, what then happens to the structures of the autopoiesis of consciousness is something completely different from what is thereby made possible or facilitated as communication."

If one wants to know how the apparent arbitrariness of the construction is reduced, one has to observe the observer and not what he observes. The child is not a chemical, not a biological, not a psychological medium, it is not a carbon, not a protein, not an attention. It is a medium only in the system of education and the changes in the conception of this medium are therefore explained by the differentiation of a social functional system for education.

And only an observer can form ideas about the further use of knowledge in future cases - but also he does this only in the moment by doing this, thus only in the consummation of his own autopoiesis. Thus, if teachers assume that the knowledge they impart to their students will be useful in their future, this is their (all too understandable) observer knowledge; and they do not know it when they are busy with something else, such as digging their garden in the afternoon. All knowledge has only temporal actuality, and inactual (actualizable) knowledge can exist only as the actual knowledge of an observer."

Here it is not only about learning to write and read in the sense of a skill to be used daily, but about the question how this peculiar form of perception works; and not only about the fact that it itself stands out as a difference to other optical perceptions like spoken language in the medium of acoustics, but about the fact that it serves as a form for formations, i.e. in its turn as a medium. Writing opens up a space of possibilities that can no longer be exhausted by any individual and that remains stable even if the contents change; not the heaven of heavens, but the form of the forms that serve as culture. Writing \"potentializes\" culture by preserving even what is not written as something that could be written if needed. (This is true to an even greater degree for phonetic scripts, which destroy any illusion of a closed world as soon as their presence becomes universal through letterpress printing). This forces selection methodology, forces consequence learning, forces the transition from situational to systematic relevance. And at the same time these effects, because they are owed to the medium-function (and not only to the form) of writing, obscure what is let into the child as a form generating form."

For the selection of the material the legitimation by science is sufficient. Science, however, does not guarantee knowledge the form in which it can be used psychologically and situationally. This explains striking discrepancies between everyday competence and scholastic ability. This is true not only for foreign language teaching (for which there are certainly corrective measures), but also, for example, for dealing with algorithms. Research on this is in its infancy, but it already clearly shows that everyday competence (when children are, so to speak, engaged like adults) can be far higher than what is demonstrated and rewarded as arithmetic in schools. Children can perform arithmetic operations in games, on the street or in jobs, which they cannot reproduce in school with arithmetic taught there."

For the medium [[Child]] it is significant that as an educator one has to choose the attribution form experience, even and especially when the child obviously acts according to everybody's opinion and according to his own opinion. The extravagance (and artificiality) of the medium of education thus shows itself in the fact that an initially obvious attributional addressing is abandoned or bracketed and replaced by the question: how does the child experience when he behaves in a certain way? This is not least a suspension of the normal moral sanction mechanism and the creation of a free space for educationally specific sanctions, which can then lead to the formation of a selection medium on the basis of the difference of better or worse performance. Like all function-specific media, this too presupposes distance from morality; and the excuse here is that the child is \"not yet\" fully responsible for its actions (unlike adults!)."

The formula learning ability postulates a principle of the selection of forms of knowledge, which is aligned to the learning possibilities, which they convey. And learning possibility means precisely that new, not yet determined coupling possibilities are generated. Thus the child learns to walk upright in order to gain in this way still undetermined learning possibilities. The same through language learning and through learning to read. The same by all kinds of professional competence, which do not determine how one will behave in situations (the old error of searching for applicable knowledge), but pre-structure situational observations in such a way that one can learn quickly and therefore easily do without preconceived opinions (strict couplings). One will not speak therefore necessarily up to the high age of \"children \"46.
