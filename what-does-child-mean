And they are structure-determined systems in the sense that they need structures for the continuation from operation to operation, which limit the range of connection possibilities, so that an observer can distinguish and designate their unity by describing their structures (here for example: attitudes, habits, character traits)."

      "text": "We are helped in this context by the notion of [[Structural Coupling]], here: of communication and consciousness. Of course, communication, although autopoietically organized in its own sequence, is not possible without consciousness. Consciousness can operate without participation in communication and can even structure its own thought sequences linguistically; but it cannot come into being (or only in a very rudimentary form) if it has never participated in linguistic communication. Using a term of Humberto Maturana, such a connection can be called structural coupling. Structural couplings presuppose a continuum of materiality of a physical kind that supports them and makes common seeing and hearing possible. Their basis thus lies in another medium that enables the autopoiesis of communication and of consciousness without interfering with them in a determinative way. Structural couplings are therefore compatible with the autopoiesis of the coupled systems, which is an essential feature of the concept. They also do not enter the continuation of autopoiesis as a structural moment and thus as an operative requirement. On the screen of the involved systems, they become recognizable only as irritation, and as irritation that co-determines what happens on it."

      "text": "[[Irritation]] is a system-specific state; it can occur, similar to surprise for example, only thanks to the recursive interconnectedness of operations and structures with which the system reproduces itself. Irritation is, in other words, not something that is already present in the environment and can then be transferred into the system. The transformation of structural couplings (here: of communication and consciousness) into irritations thus links a system/environment connection, which only an observer can see, with states of its own, to which the system can react autopoietically and, with more or less consequences, must react. Structural coupling gives impetus to a kind of permanent irritation of the systems; and if it repeats itself with a certain permanence and affects the system with a certain typicality (for instance as language), it can be assumed that it triggers structural developments in the system which an observer can recognize as directed, at least as not accidental. The key to the problem of socialization lies in the permanent irritations that occur in consciousness when it participates in communication again and again and in repeatable forms (language). It can be explained in this way (1) that all socialization is self-socialization, i.e. it cannot come about in the form of a transference; that it (2) produces a variety of systemic forms far beyond the triggering conditions, for example in a family very different children despite similar conditions; that it (3) nevertheless leads in a non-random direction, which makes it possible that people can adjust to each other in spite of self-referential closure, in spite of mutual intransparency and in spite of high structural difference; and that (4) the participation in linguistic communication with its distinctive, fascinating world of forms is the key experience for this – whatever the individual consciousness thinks of it.

      "text": "Socialization in this complex sense depends on keeping linguistic communication going. For this, in more complex societies, certain improbability thresholds have to be overcome, and for this, only for this, the medium child serves in the case of education. If this is so, it will hardly be possible to avoid that the so-called child reacts to the fact that it is treated as such. One should know more about what happens in the consciousness when it registers that it is treated as a child (or at any rate: differently from adults); that is, whether and how the permissions and prohibitions, freedom concessions and notions of being able, not able, not yet able, not yet having to but still being able, lying in the context of this semantics, have an effect on structural changes of this system. It would be naïve to assume that these effects will automatically meet the pedagogical intention. For even when a consciousness learns to describe itself as a child and to take over the childlike part in communication, what then happens to the structures of the autopoiesis of consciousness is something completely different from what is thereby made possible or facilitated as communication."

Nobody, not even Locke, would have assumed that man is an empty box into which arbitrary contents could be filled. It is just a black box with which an observer can experiment. The child is medium only in the sense that a sufficiently loose coupling of his thoughts and ideas can be assumed, which are then available for accesses, for form-strict couplings, especially for \"knowledge\". \"Black box\" means only that it is not possible to see through and to control how what is identified in this way functions internally. There is, in other words, no \"[[Requisite Variety]]\" towards it, and a fortiori no other mental system and no social system can establish a one-to-one relation of its elements to those of the black box, because that would mean to merge the systems into a single system. And this is true not only for external observation, but also and even more so for internal observation, for self-observation. For every observer, also for himself, the system is and remains intransparent."

This is true for the psychological system of educators. It is even more true for the communication system of education. Intransparency is the take off for differentiation and thus for the self-determination of the differentiating systems.

This abandons the tendency toward perfection postulated as nature and replaces it with the mere designation of a possibility. In it, success and failure are provided for, which is always introduced as a criterion of success, and the utopian staging of Emile's education makes it abundantly clear how unlikely success is.

For them, therefore, perfectibility is the \"ability to become ever more perfect as an endowment of man as distinguished from the animal.\" Thus conceived, the concept serves a function for the profession – much as the concept of original sin does for theologians: it is difficult, but not impossible. One can save souls or educate young people, but only with professional assistance. The concept encourages higher aspirations."

But one has to look for the limitations not so much in the organic-psychic systems designated as children, but in the system that practices this designation and condenses experiences with it. If one wants to know how the apparent arbitrariness of the construction is reduced, one has to observe the observer and not what he observes. The child is not a chemical, not a biological, not a psychological medium, it is not a carbon, not a protein, not an attention. It is a medium only in the system of education and the changes in the conception of this medium are therefore explained by the differentiation of a social functional system for education. Consequently, the next question is: how does the system of education deal with its medium?"

For this, in more complex societies, certain improbability thresholds have to be overcome, and for this, only for this, the medium child serves in the case of education. If this is so, it will hardly be possible to avoid that the so-called child reacts to the fact that it is treated as such. One should know more about what happens in the consciousness when it registers that it is treated as a child (or at any rate: differently from adults); that is, whether and how the permissions and prohibitions, freedom concessions and notions of being able, not able, not yet able, not yet having to but still being able, lying in the context of this semantics, have an effect on structural changes of this system. It would be naïve to assume that these effects will automatically meet the pedagogical intention. For even when a consciousness learns to describe itself as a child and to take over the childlike part in communication, what then happens to the structures of the autopoiesis of consciousness is something completely different from what is thereby made possible or facilitated as communication."

        "text": "The obviousness and exceptionlessness of this intransparency gives education the chance to construct a medium. Not knowing (and this includes that the observed system cannot know itself better, only differently) gives courage to the educators. They operate irrefutably in this fundamental sense – which, of course, does not preclude their gaining experience, learning, doing better or worse, insofar as they have memory. This is true for the psychological system of educators. It is even more true for the communication system of education. Intransparency is the take off for differentiation and thus for the self-determination of the differentiating systems. Or, to repeat: a one-to-one relationship of the elements would, if achievable, lead to the formation of a coalescing system."

This abandons the tendency toward perfection postulated as nature and replaces it with the mere designation of a possibility. In it, success and failure are provided for, which is always introduced as a criterion of success, and the utopian staging of Emile's education makes it abundantly clear how unlikely success is. Perfection itself does not guarantee it, in any case."

They had to find a place for themselves in the open concept of perfectibility, they had to take it as a medium into which one could implant good intentions. For them, therefore, perfectibility is the \"ability to become ever more perfect as an endowment of man as distinguished from the animal.\" Thus conceived, the concept serves a function for the profession – much as the concept of original sin does for theologians: it is difficult, but not impossible. One can save souls or educate young people, but only with professional assistance. The concept encourages higher aspirations."

        "text": "The fact that the designation child is a construct and can only function as a medium in this way does not mean that one can proceed arbitrarily. But one has to look for the limitations not so much in the organic-psychic systems designated as children, but in the system that practices this designation and condenses experiences with it. If one wants to know how the apparent arbitrariness of the construction is reduced, one has to observe the observer and not what he observes. The child is not a chemical, not a biological, not a psychological medium, it is not a carbon, not a protein, not an attention. It is a medium only in the system of education and the changes in the conception of this medium are therefore explained by the differentiation of a social functional system for education. Consequently, the next question is: how does the system of education deal with its medium?"
