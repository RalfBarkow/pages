American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk [[emergency improvisation]] of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the [[defense]] establishment. **We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United State corporations.**\n\nThis conjunction of an immense [[military establishment]] and a large [[arms industry]] is new in the American experience. The total influence-economic, political, even spiritual-is felt in every city, every state house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development.

A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the [[Federal government]].\n\nToday, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the [[free university]], historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research.

I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.\n\n \n\nOur people expect their President and the Congress to find essential agreement on issues of great moment, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of the Nation.\n\nMy own relations with the Congress, which began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point, have since ranged to the intimate during the war and immediate post-war period, and, finally, to the mutually interdependent during these past eight years.\n\nIn this final relationship, the Congress and the Administration have, on most vital issues, cooperated well, to serve the national good rather than mere partisanship, and so have assured that the business of the Nation should go forward. So, my official relationship with the Congress ends in a feeling, on my part, of gratitude that we have been able to do so much together.\n\n******\n\n \n\nWe now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations. Three of these involved our own country. Despite these holocausts America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world. Understandably proud of this pre-eminence, we yet realize that America's leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.\n\n******\n\n \n\nThroughout America's adventure in free government, our basic purposes have been to keep the peace; to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity among people and among nations. To strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people. Any failure traceable to arrogance, or our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt both at home and abroad.\n\nProgress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world. It commands our whole attention, absorbs our very beings. We face a hostile ideology-global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method. Unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration. To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle-with liberty at stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment.\n\nCrises there will continue to be. In meeting them, whether foreign or domestic, great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties. A huge increase in newer elements of our defense; development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture; a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research-these and many other possibilities, each possibly promising in itself, may be suggested as the only way to the road we which to travel.\n\nBut each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs-balance between the private and the public economy, balance between cost and hoped for advantage-balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable; balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual; balance between action of the moment and the national welfare of the future. Good judgment seeks balance and progress; lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration.\n\nThe record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their government have, in the main, understood these truths and have responded to them well, in the face of stress and threat. But threats, new in kind or degree, constantly arise. I mention two only.\n\n******\n\n \n\nA vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.\n\nOur military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peace time, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.\n\nUntil the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United State corporations.\n\nThis conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence-economic, political, even spiritual-is felt in every city, every state house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.\n\nIn the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\n\nWe must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.\n\nAkin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.\n\nIn this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.\n\nToday, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been over shadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.\n\nThe prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.\n\nYet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.\n\nIt is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system-ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.\n\n******\n\n \n\nAnother factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time.

To strive for less would be unworthy of a free and [[religious]] people. Any failure traceable to [[arrogance]], or our lack of comprehension or readiness to [[sacrifice]] would inflict upon us grievous hurt both at home and abroad.\n\nProgress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the [[conflict]] now engulfing the world. It commands our whole attention, absorbs our very beings. We face a hostile [[ideology]]-global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method. Unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite [[duration]]. To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex [[struggle]]-with liberty at stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment.\n\n[[Crises]] there will continue to be. In meeting them, whether foreign or domestic, great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the [[miraculous solution]] to all current difficulties. A huge increase in newer elements of our defense; development of [[unrealistic programs]] to cure every ill in agriculture; a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research-these and many other possibilities, each possibly promising in itself, may be suggested as [[the only way]] to the road we which to travel.\n\nBut each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain [[balance]] in and among national programs-balance between the [[private]] and the [[public]] economy, balance between cost and hoped for advantage-balance between the clearly [[necessary]] and the comfortably [[desirable]]; balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the [[duties]] imposed by the nation upon the individual; balance between action of the moment and the national welfare of the [[future]]. Good judgment seeks balance and progress; lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration.\n\nThe record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their government have, in the main, understood these truths and have responded to them well, in the face of [[stress and threat]]. But threats, new in kind or degree, constantly arise. I mention two only.\n\n******\n\n"
