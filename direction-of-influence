As an alternative to the power-through-communication para digm, which such strategies seem to be based upon, a power-through-model paradigm is suggested: Models are required in order to utilize information offers and exert and withstand influence. This is illustrated by contrasting the operations of two systems, one of which lacks model resources and thus is completely dependent upon external feedback. The other system may carry out internal trials through simulation, and strengthen its model power through comparisons between real and simulated outcomes. If a model-strong actor and model-weak actor are coupled in an open information exchange system, the former may be expected to gradually increase his control of the other actor. Offers of information are useful only to the extent that there is model capacity for processing the information offered. Thus a successful transition in the name of democratization to a more open communi cation structure may freeze - or even increase - the influence gap. Independent development of system model resources among the less influentials is required.\n"
