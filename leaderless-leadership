To support this, in this report we provide a collection of universal principles (the doctrine table) along with a simple mechanism to test your own against it.

Alongside this, continue your efforts to encourage remote working, recover costs from unused assets and resist the temptation to return to the office.\n1. Provide time for your guiding principles to embed and to reflect on any outcome. Investment may be needed in removing legacy systems, adopting serverless and other areas designed to meet user needs. These investments should be guided by the principles.\n1. Once you are satisfied that basic guiding principles are in place and remote working has become accepted as a norm, focus on orchestration, structure, increasing awareness, business model and learning. Re-evaluate sunk costs in past technology programmes including existing data lakes or private cloud environments. In many cases, attempts to create siloed data stores or home-grown efforts may well have been counterproductive and will need to be dismantled and costs recovered.\n1. When those steps are completed, focus increasingly on issues of sustainability, how it influences and is influenced by others, and technology. Many of these questions relate to the security and resilience of the organization itself. At this point, investment in technology areas such as AI may provide valuable complements to human capability, depending upon your context."
