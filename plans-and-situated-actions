The European navigator, course and sextant in hand, exemplifies the role of cognitive science as it relentlessly prowls from subgoal to subgoal under the guidance of an overall plan. The Trukese navigator does not sail under control of an a priori plan, but instead modifies his behavior as wind, waves, and weather conspire to alter his local environment."

Face-to-face interaction is considered by Suchman to be the best tool for enhancing communication. Therefore, chapter 7 contains many tables that describe the interaction between two users, A and B, and the copying machine: \"A decomposes and re-presents the instructions provided by the system, such that they are fit more precisely to B's actions in carrying them out. A is able to do this because of her sensitivity to what B is doing, including B's troubles\" (p. 124). Later tables document the face-to-face interactions of users C and D as well as users E and F. Analysis of these discussions (situated inquiries) allows the ethnomethodologist to locate problems in system design. For example, user D states, \"We're supposed to have five copies and we only got one.\" User C replies, \"Oh (looks to display). We only got one?\" To which user D replies, \"Yea (long pause).\" User C asks, \"What do we do then?\""

'given that we were supposed to have five copies and we only got one' \" [p. 134]) reveals a conflict between the actual output of the system (one copy) versus the intended goal of the operator (five copies). Thus, the system prompt to do the next step in the procedure is inappropriate and fails to help the operators."

      "text": "These examples did not convince me that such new methods offer great power. The discipline of human factors has much more sophisticated tools, assembled over many decades under the general rubric of [[Task Analysis]], to solve exactly this problem. Although ethnomethodology may prove in some circumstances to be a worthwhile addition to the task-analysis toolbox, it is hardly the scientific revolution that will make all other approaches to the problem of person-machine interfaces irrelevant. I can illustrate the great virtue of this book by relating a real incident that happened to me while scuba diving in Fiji. The weather had worsened during the dive, and when I returned to the boat no land was in sight. After about 10 minutes, I realized that the native guide had the boat going in circles around the reef and that we were no closer to land. I was shocked to discover that the boat had no compass, but being a prepared diver in the European tradition, I offered my wrist compass to our navigator. I realized that he had never used a compass before when he asked me why my watch had only one hand. Since I was getting cold and a trifle frightened by visions of the boat arriving in Australia, I explained that the single hand of the compass pointed north. \"That's no good,\" my guide exclaimed, \"we want to go south.\" Fortunately, some friendly dolphins guided us to land that our guide recognized, and eventually we found our way home. My assumptions about civilization, navigation, and the dangers of being in a small open boat had been recalibrated. This book offers such useful recalibration, even though the methods proposed may not be superior to existing techniques."

        "text": "For readers with little knowledge of ethnomethodology, let me summarize the technique used in chapter 7. Face-to-face interaction is considered by Suchman to be the best tool for enhancing communication. Therefore, chapter 7 contains many tables that describe the interaction between two users, A and B, and the copying machine: \"A decomposes and re-presents the instructions provided by the system, such that they are fit more precisely to B's actions in carrying them out. A is able to do this because of her sensitivity to what B is doing, including B's troubles\" (p. 124). Later tables document the face-to-face interactions of users C and D as well as users E and F. Analysis of these discussions (situated inquiries) allows the ethnomethodologist to locate problems in system design. For example, user D states, \"We're supposed to have five copies and we only got one.\" User C replies, \"Oh (looks to display). We only got one?\" To which user D replies, \"Yea (long pause).\" User C asks, \"What do we do then?\""

        "text": "Suchman stresses that this last user's question is not a request for the next step in a procedure, but instead is a \"request for a remedy to the current trouble.\" The situated nature of the inquiry (\"indicated anaphorically by the 'then,' viz. 'given that we were supposed to have five copies and we only got one' \" [p. 134]) reveals a conflict between the actual output of the system (one copy) versus the intended goal of the operator (five copies). Thus, the system prompt to do the next step in the procedure is inappropriate and fails to help the operators."

My assumptions about civilization, navigation, and the dangers of being in a small open boat had been recalibrated. This book offers such useful recalibration, even though the methods proposed may not be superior to existing techniques."
