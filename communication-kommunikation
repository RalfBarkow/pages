      "text": "The process of communication can be observed as decomposed in actions, since reproduction of communication requires attribution of action. Action is not an operation of social systems, but a way of making this operation visible in the system. Firstly, attribution of action makes it possible to observe if understanding, and therefore communication, has been achieved. Secondly, attribution of action refers to previous utterance or information and makes it possible to attribute responsibilities, intentions and motives for it. Thus, by attributing action, participants can know whom they are addressing. Attribution of action enables the observation that someone has said something, and thus the observation of the difference between utterance and information. This observation allows the self-referential connection between communications, making it possible to establish the communication process as a series of observable events. Thus, through attribution of action, the communication process can observe itself: the following communication can refer to what has been said, by answering, questioning, refusing, and so on. Attribution of action is a simplification of communication, as it does not include observation of connections between communications and autopoiesis. It is a necessary simplification that allows a social system constitute its operations with reference to its operations. The attribution of action is necessary for the autopoiesis of social systems, as it provides the possibility for self-reference. However, the attribution of action also presupposes the autopoiesis of communication, as action can be attributed only if it is understood.\n"

This means that communication cannot be reduced to perception; for instance, to one participant’s sight of another participant or hearing her voice, since perception does not include understanding the responsibility for producing an utterance; we can perceive that our stomach grumbles, but we cannot attribute any responsibility for selecting an utterance to our stomach.\n"

        "text": "Since it is designed in a unique way, an utterance of information is a selection. Utterance of information shows intentions, motives, reasons and knowledge. It shows responsibility for speaking and for the reasons for speak- ing (e.g., by saying that it is raining, the speaker is answering a question, or is trying to make it clear that she would like to stay at home). However, ut- terance of information is not communication in itself, as understanding is the selection that realizes communication. Understanding draws a distinction between information (today it is raining) and utterance (the reason why the interlocutor says that today it is raining). The realization of communica- tion requires the understanding of this difference, between information and (responsibility for) its utterance. Understanding does not concern objective pieces of information or authentic reasons for uttering; rather, it concerns the →attribution of selections as information and (reasons for) utterance.Thus, understanding is achieved even if the uttered information or reasons for ut- terance are misunderstood or deceptive, and any kind of understanding real- izes communication.\nThrough understanding, communication can stress who has uttered what. Therefore, understanding makes it possible for further communication to re- fer to either previous utterances (someone’s motives or intentions) or uttered information (what), thus generating communication →processes. Understand- ing, rather than for thinking, is important for the reproduction of communi- cation, although thinking is related to communication [→Interpenetration and Structural Coupling].\nUtterance, information and understanding can be separated for analytical purposes, but they are a unity in communication, which cannot be decom- posed. This unity does not last, since understanding, utterance and informa- tion are realized simultaneously. Communication is an →event, which imme- diately disappears. Since each communication disappears immediately, each communication is new. Going beyond specific communicative events, com- munication processes require that each communication is followed by another communication connecting to it through understanding. Thus, each commu- nication is produced by a recursive network of communications which de- fines the unity of a →social system, and communication may be seen as the spe- cific operation that produces a social system. In other words, social systems use communication as a specific operation for autopoietic reproduction [→Au- topoiesis], and the continuation of communication achieves the autopoiesis of a social system. Social systems have communication as their basic operation and include only communication. An important consequence is that individ- uals, as →psychic systems, are not included in social systems; rather, they are systems in the environment of social systems.\nSince all communications are included in social systems, there is no com- munication between a social system and its environment. Social systems are closed systems that produce information through communication; they do not receive information from their environments. However, social systems are also open to their environments, as they can observe [→Operation/Observation] it in the form of information produced in communication: what is not communication (e.g., conscience, biological life, physical machines, chemical elements) can be observed in communication as information. Communica- tion allows the differentiation of the attribution of selections to the system (as utterance) and to its environment (as information). This also means that communication allows the distinction and recombination of the reference to the system and reference to the environment [→Self-Reference].\nThe process of communication can be observed as decomposed in actions, since reproduction of communication requires attribution of action. Action is not an operation of social systems, but a way of making this operation vis- ible in the system. Firstly, attribution of action makes it possible to observe if understanding, and therefore communication, has been achieved. Secondly, attribution of action refers to previous utterance or information and makes it possible to attribute responsibilities, intentions and motives for it. Thus, by attributing action, participants can know whom they are addressing. Attribu- tion of action enables the observation that someone has said something, and thus the observation of the difference between utterance and information. This observation allows the self-referential connection between communica- tions, making it possible to establish the communication process as a series of observable events. Thus, through attribution of action, the communication process can observe itself: the following communication can refer to what has been said, by answering, questioning, refusing, and so on. Attribution of action is a simplification of communication, as it does not include observa- tion of connections between communications and autopoiesis. It is a neces- sary simplification that allows a social system constitute its operations with reference to its operations. The attribution of action is necessary for the au- topoiesis of social systems, as it provides the possibility for self-reference. However, the attribution of action also presupposes the autopoiesis of com- munication, as action can be attributed only if it is understood.\n"

However, social systems are also open to their environments, as they can observe [→[[Operation/Observation]]] it in the form of information produced in communication: what is not communication (e.g., conscience, biological life, physical machines, chemical elements) can be observed in communication as information. Communication allows the differentiation of the attribution of selections to the system (as utterance) and to its environment (as information). This also means that communication allows the distinction and recombination of the reference to the system and reference to the environment [→[[Self-Reference]]].\n"

        "text": "The process of communication can be observed as decomposed in actions, since reproduction of communication requires attribution of action. Action is not an operation of social systems, but a way of making this operation visible in the system. Firstly, attribution of action makes it possible to observe if understanding, and therefore communication, has been achieved. Secondly, attribution of action refers to previous utterance or information and makes it possible to attribute responsibilities, intentions and motives for it. Thus, by attributing action, participants can know whom they are addressing. Attribution of action enables the observation that someone has said something, and thus the observation of the difference between utterance and information. This observation allows the self-referential connection between communications, making it possible to establish the communication process as a series of observable events. Thus, through attribution of action, the communication process can observe itself: the following communication can refer to what has been said, by answering, questioning, refusing, and so on. Attribution of action is a simplification of communication, as it does not include observation of connections between communications and autopoiesis. It is a necessary simplification that allows a social system constitute its operations with reference to its operations. The attribution of action is necessary for the autopoiesis of social systems, as it provides the possibility for self-reference. However, the attribution of action also presupposes the autopoiesis of communication, as action can be attributed only if it is understood.\n"

It shows responsibility for speaking and for the reasons for speaking (e.g., by saying that it is raining, the speaker is answering a question, or is trying to make it clear that she would like to stay at home). However, utterance of information is not communication in itself, as understanding is the selection that realizes communication. Understanding draws a distinction between information (today it is raining) and utterance (the reason why the interlocutor says that today it is raining). The realization of communication requires the understanding of this difference, between information and (responsibility for) its utterance. Understanding does not concern objective pieces of information or authentic reasons for uttering; rather, it concerns the →[[Attribution]] of selections as information and (reasons for) utterance. Thus, understanding is achieved even if the uttered information or reasons for utterance are misunderstood or deceptive, and any kind of understanding realizes communication.\n\n"
