These days, \"Other Russia\" accuses him of moving further and further away from the movement and adopting increasingly pro-government positions until he almost became part of the state apparatus. The National Bolsheviks were in opposition to Putin's government until they were banned in 2005. Limonov even served years in prison beginning in 2001. Among other things, he was accused of planning an armed invasion of Kazakhstan. From 2006 onward, Limonov was part of the opposition alliance \"Other Russia,\" which also included liberal oppositionists."

At the time, Navalny sought an alliance with nationalists and also took part in far-right demonstrations. In 2010, Prilepin, like Limonov, supported the opposition campaign \"Putin must go.\" Eight years later, however, Prilepin then joined the All-Russia Popular Front (ONF), a coalition of numerous parties and organizations loyal to the Kremlin. Limonov then expelled him from the Other Russia party, which he had founded in 2010. The National Bolsheviks were a patriotic and socialist opposition, and Prilepin had become shabbier, more mendacious, and more commercial in recent years, the party said recently."

The goal of National Bolshevism, it said, was to create an \"empire from Vladivostok to Gibraltar on the basis of Russian civilization\". The essence of National Bolshevism, it said, lay in \"the annihilating hatred of the anti-human system of the trinity: liberalism/democracy/capitalism.\" Instead, they wanted to build a new \"traditionalist, hierarchical society\" on the basis of \"spiritual masculinity and social and national justice.\""

These days, \"Other Russia\" accuses him of moving further and further away from the movement and adopting increasingly pro-government positions until he almost became part of the state apparatus. The National Bolsheviks were in opposition to Putin's government until they were banned in 2005. Limonov even served years in prison beginning in 2001. Among other things, he was accused of planning an armed invasion of Kazakhstan. From 2006 onward, Limonov was part of the opposition alliance \"Other Russia,\" which also included liberal oppositionists."
