As part of their reflection process, many are beginning to sketch how their learning journeys feel and unfold. They’re feeling the power of the struggle and moving past the ‘old game of school’ thinking where the steps are defined for them. The result is equal parts inspiring and thought-provoking. "

The impact of following personal curiosity authentically and being given opportunities to be heard and seen is powerful. Throughout a DiG journey, our learners are prompted to notice surprise, delight, and wonder. We’re consciously capturing and emphasising the emotions attached to the learning process. We’re making the feelings connected to learning overt and it's working to deepen personal connections and making the emotional journey of learning explicit."
