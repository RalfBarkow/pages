By editing an image to produce a desired result, a scientist can manufacture proof for a favored hypothesis, or create a signal out of noise. Scientists must rely on and build on one another's work. Cheating is a transgression against everything that science should be. If scientific papers contain errors or&#8212;much worse -- fraudulent data and fabricated imagery, other researchers are likely to waste time and grant money chasing theories based on made-up results."

Half of these appeared to have been manipulated deliberately &amp;mdash; rotated, flipped, stretched or otherwise photoshopped. With a sense of unease about how much bad science might be in journals, I quit my full-time job in 2019 so that I could devote myself to finding and reporting more cases of scientific fraud."
