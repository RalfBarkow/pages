For the disciplines concerned with the interpretation of signs and testimonies in the early modern period (including theology, historiography, jurisprudence, medicine, but also logic and rhetoric), such integrative studies in the history of science have generally been omitted. The transfer of knowledge from the \"human sciences\" to the natural sciences, insofar as its attention has seemed useful to a historical reconstruction of the mathematization of probability, has become the subject of sophisticated investigations. The question, however, whether there was an inverse transfer of knowledge from the natural sciences to the \"human sciences\" has hardly become the subject of far-reaching attempts to answer. Against this background, it is not surprising that the relationship between early modern notions of probability in the sciences (both natural and human) and in the arts has not attracted much academic attention. For instance, the question of whether insightful connections between scientific and poetological conceptions of probability can be traced for the early modern period is still not adequately resolved."

Should these assessments prove to be correct and well-founded, much would be gained for the study of the early modern poetological concept of probability. Within the framework of the increasingly dynamic research program of a consistent historicization of the basic categories of literary theory (author, text, work, reader, fiction, literature, etc.), Esposito's history of the emergence of the modern poetological concept of probability would then undoubtedly occupy a prominent place."
