You see, I always rewrote our charts before displaying them, careful to perfect my writing before hanging them in their prized places. "

During my classroom teaching days at Griffin, my walls transformed to work for learners and learning. I now support others to do the same. Our walls do the heavy lifting; they exemplify, guide, prompt, and sometimes answer. They are used, they are referred to, they support, they document. Our walls morph and change in response to learners and learning journeys. "

They house learning, questions, wonders, thinking, co-constructed tools, and unfolding journeys. Most importantly, the learners are visible as owners of the learning. It is evidenced on the walls that our identity as teachers is shifting. Our classroom walls teach and offer feedback as much as we do. Learners also use the walls to engage in peer reflection and to give feedback to each other."

Noticeboards were decorated with unit titles and themed borders, and then filled with second-draft brainstorm charts that I scribed for the kids. You see, I always rewrote our charts before displaying them, careful to perfect my writing before hanging them in their prized places. "

They served simply to display, to ‘show off’ products, to prove that my kids were learning something, and sadly, they were owned and used only by me. "

Our walls morph and change in response to learners and learning journeys. "
