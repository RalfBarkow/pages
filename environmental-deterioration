      "text": "\"Regulation of [[Environmental Deterioration]],” Hawk, D.L., Dissertation, Social Systems Sciences Program, University of Pennsylvania, 1979. The thesis was that environmental deterioration resulted from an inability to appreciate context. This was because social systems have become addicted to use of an analytic frame of partial thought. The most worrisome aspect of the resulting dilemma was that the same analytical model that had created the situation was now being used to resolve it. The situation was doubly damned by then being formalized and institutionalized via a legal system that was designed for stable environments. The recommendation from the work was to move from the “legal order” model, that values stability, to a negotiated order approach, that embraces dynamics.
