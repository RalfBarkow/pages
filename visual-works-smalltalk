            "text": "\nAre there any quickstart guides to VW? I'm playing with [[Open Talk]] at the moment and there is a total of <b>ONE</b> useful example on the whole bloody damned web about it. The only guide I found was for 5i and starts by telling you to click on the [[Open Talk]] Launcher, which doesn't exist as far as I can tell. And the PDF only works as an intro to the subject in general and reference, not a guide per se. This is endemic to all serious frameworks and tools near as I can tell. (Oh, and I know Cincom's <i>planning</i> to make quickstart guides but I'm not long on patience.) -- RK",
