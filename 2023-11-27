The scandalizing power of this (sociologically understood) difference lay in the fact that it could be used to arrange psychological and social operations into a reciprocal system/environment relationship.

It says (in the reading I ([[Peter Fuchs]]) choose) that – firstly – everything that appears generates its epiphany historically (this is what the adjective 'conditioned' means), and – secondly – that this generation is bound to the economy of a [[Unity]] that is only a [[Duality]] for one observer. As little as there is the master without the servant, the servant without the master, as little as there are neither masters nor servants, so little 'exists' one side of the difference (the system) without the other side (the environment). The metaphors of entanglement, interlocking, coupling, interpenetration, but also of the boundary are inadequate in view of this. They are already worked within the framework of an occult ontology of space."

      "text": "@Ward:matrix.org\n\n    mike_hales\n    Catchup time! Please, pioneers, point me to tools & method(s) that seem best for preparing box-and-arrow diagrams with clickable nodes, for import to wiki as GraphViz or svg?\n\n    Most of the embedded links will be to pages in wiki, but not necessarily inside the same site as the diagram.\n\nTwo days ago I wrote a dozen paragraphs picking at one small part of Mike's inquiry. He has in the notes explained why he wanted diagrams to span multiple sites. I am satisfied that he knows what he is doing. If I had a good list of the tools & method(s) I would share it. There are many candidates for such a list but they all push a little beyond what we expect of wiki text in various ways. As a consequence frequent needs are met in different ways and the ways don't work gracefully together. I am reminded of the XKCD cartoon where the engineer attempts to unify 14 different standards and finds that he now has 15 different standards.\n\nAt New Relic I built and maintained a large heterogenous model from which I could query and diagram useful relationships addressing a large number of interests. For several years now I have been exploring how federated wiki's data mechanisms could duplicate and improve on that work. Each has a simple model: nodes and edges in one case, pages and links in the other. The most essential difference is their approach to scale. At New Relic I built on Neo4j, a performant graph database. I was rewarded by ability to write queries that spanned forty distinct systems, from production, to development and management. This meant that I had thus turned one job into forty. Oops.\n\nThe Hypertext Super Collaborator explored the best of our more recent approaches to integrating nodes and edges, what ever they might represent. Through this I discovered that assembling small graphs into the graph you need in the moment is both easier and more maintainable than extracting the graph you need out of a huge and creaky database as I have done before. So now it is time to bring the best of the super collaborator back into wiki and hopefully support it graceful interoperability with many sources. Let me describe two cooperating mechanisms: Site Survey and Merged Graph Browsing. Rather than explain each, I will point instead to works that exemplify the capabilities.\n\nA Site Survey probes every page of a site collecting recognizable content into a single object attached to the script that will refresh it. My first probe looked for mentions of amateur radio callsigns. Mine is K9OX. A more interesting survey is the Image Caption Survey with finds images on pages and indexes their captions. I inferred connections between pages when they held similarly captioned images. I also used the unique identifiers generated by the Image plugin to relate pages that included the same image, perhaps scaled differently and with a modified caption. I have one page that summaries these Photo Aggregations with links to the code that constructs them from the surveys.\n\nThe most outstanding feature of the super collaborator was its ability to merge many related graphs into one, apply one of several color schemes to the result, and then browse any or all of it with intuitive zoom controls. A less outstanding feature was that it was built upon the Croquet synchronous event distribution model that didn't seem to help anyone. I've now extracted the graphic parts of that codebase as the Solo Super Collaborator and fed the problem of the moment, understanding the intricacies of our federation search, in a series of four graphs. I'm using a variation of Site Survey to index source code files clickable to the line of code implementing any important relation. You can try this by clicking any edge label in one of the generated svg documents. Most recently I've shown that I can similarly index html scripts that query and format search results. This means that I can compose in a single diagram, both the client and server halves of this system.\n\nAgain I have spent an early morning writing about two of the four or five most interesting things happening in this space. I thank you for your attention.\n"

In particular, the aim is to work out a functional difference between the two types of communication experts. Finally, the term PR consultant is differentiated on the basis of these distinctions."

Please, pioneers, point me to tools & method(s) that seem best for preparing box-and-arrow diagrams with clickable nodes, for import to wiki as GraphViz or svg?\n\n    Most of the embedded links will be to pages in wiki, but not necessarily inside the same site as the diagram.\n\nTwo days ago I wrote a dozen paragraphs picking at one small part of Mike's inquiry. He has in the notes explained why he wanted diagrams to span multiple sites. I am satisfied that he knows what he is doing. If I had a good list of the tools & method(s) I would share it. There are many candidates for such a list but they all push a little beyond what we expect of wiki text in various ways. As a consequence frequent needs are met in different ways and the ways don't work gracefully together. I am reminded of the XKCD cartoon where the engineer attempts to unify 14 different standards and finds that he now has 15 different standards.\n\nAt New Relic I built and maintained a large heterogenous model from which I could query and diagram useful relationships addressing a large number of interests. For several years now I have been exploring how federated wiki's data mechanisms could duplicate and improve on that work. Each has a simple model: nodes and edges in one case, pages and links in the other. The most essential difference is their approach to scale. At New Relic I built on Neo4j, a performant graph database. I was rewarded by ability to write queries that spanned forty distinct systems, from production, to development and management. This meant that I had thus turned one job into forty. Oops.\n\nThe Hypertext Super Collaborator explored the best of our more recent approaches to integrating nodes and edges, what ever they might represent. Through this I discovered that assembling small graphs into the graph you need in the moment is both easier and more maintainable than extracting the graph you need out of a huge and creaky database as I have done before. So now it is time to bring the best of the super collaborator back into wiki and hopefully support it graceful interoperability with many sources. Let me describe two cooperating mechanisms: Site Survey and Merged Graph Browsing. Rather than explain each, I will point instead to works that exemplify the capabilities.\n\nA Site Survey probes every page of a site collecting recognizable content into a single object attached to the script that will refresh it. My first probe looked for mentions of amateur radio callsigns. Mine is K9OX. A more interesting survey is the Image Caption Survey with finds images on pages and indexes their captions. I inferred connections between pages when they held similarly captioned images. I also used the unique identifiers generated by the Image plugin to relate pages that included the same image, perhaps scaled differently and with a modified caption. I have one page that summaries these Photo Aggregations with links to the code that constructs them from the surveys.\n\nThe most outstanding feature of the super collaborator was its ability to merge many related graphs into one, apply one of several color schemes to the result, and then browse any or all of it with intuitive zoom controls. A less outstanding feature was that it was built upon the Croquet synchronous event distribution model that didn't seem to help anyone. I've now extracted the graphic parts of that codebase as the Solo Super Collaborator and fed the problem of the moment, understanding the intricacies of our federation search, in a series of four graphs. I'm using a variation of Site Survey to index source code files clickable to the line of code implementing any important relation. You can try this by clicking any edge label in one of the generated svg documents. Most recently I've shown that I can similarly index html scripts that query and format search results. This means that I can compose in a single diagram, both the client and server halves of this system.\n\nAgain I have spent an early morning writing about two of the four or five most interesting things happening in this space. I thank you for your attention.\n"
