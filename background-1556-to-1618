More common were events such as the 1606 'Battle of the Flags' in Donauwörth, when riots broke out after the Lutheran majority blocked a Catholic religious procession. [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]] approved intervention by the Catholic [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria]], who was allowed to annex the town, changing it from Lutheran to Catholic under the principle of ''cuius regio, eius religio'' (\"whose realm, their religion\")- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years'_War#Background:_1556_to_1618 wikipedia]"

However, in return the Habsburg heir [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]] required the immediate restoration of all property taken from the Catholic church since 1555, rather than the previous practice whereby court ruling case by case. This threatened all Protestants, paralysed the Diet, and removed the perception of Imperial neutrality."

      "text": "The reason outside powers became involved in what was an internal German dispute was the imminent expiry of the 1609 [[Twelve Years' Truce]], which suspended the [[Dutch Revolt]]. Before restarting hostilities, [[Ambrosio Spinola]], commander in the Spanish Netherlands, needed to secure the [[Spanish Road]], an overland route connecting Habsburg possessions in Italy to [[Flanders]]. This allowed him to move troops and supplies by road, rather than sea where the Dutch navy was dominant; by 1618, the only part not controlled by Spain ran through the [[Electoral Palatinate]]."

      "text": "Since [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor]] had no surviving children, in [[Oñate treaty]] [[Philip III of Spain]] agreed to support Ferdinand's election as king of [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. In return, Ferdinand made concessions to Spain in Northern Italy and Alsace, and agreed to support their offensive against the Dutch. Delivering these commitments required his election as Emperor, which was not guaranteed; one alternative was Maximilian of Bavaria, who opposed the increase of Spanish influence in an area he considered his own, and tried to create a coalition with Saxony and the Palatinate to support his candidacy."

      "text": "A third candidate was the Calvinist [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], who succeeded his father in 1610, then in 1613 married [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]], daughter of [[James VI and I]]. Four of the electors were Catholic, three Protestant; if this could be changed, it might result in a Protestant Emperor. When Ferdinand was elected king of Bohemia in 1617, he gained control of its electoral vote; however, his conservative Catholicism made him unpopular with the largely Protestant nobility, who were also concerned at the erosion of their rights. In May 1618, these factors combined to bring about the [[Bohemian Revolt]]."
