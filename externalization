Luhmann discloses that this theory, like any other theory, rests on distinctions that are basal to it. This, after all, means giving a super-theory an open flank, namely the basic interchangeability of its guiding distinctions. Thus a style of theory emerges which takes into account the self-reference of the theory."

If I claim that in Brigitte's [Brigitte Lassnigs] eyes there are lovely little angels cavorting about, this might work as a suggestion of flirtation, but hardly as an assertion of fact that would probably lead me to a state clinic or to drug screening."

And if we want to conceive of the psychic as a system of meaning, there is no choice: the psychic system is also difference, not a locative thing, not something that is somehow self-localizable. It is important for our further work here to mark this point quite sharply: The psychic system is not alive, it is not made of cells and organic molecules. It is not the brain or the neuronal system, however much it depends on this infrastructure."

        "text": "He didn't say that there are systems, he just said that we assume that there are. This is, I think, a very fair point. Luhmann discloses that this theory, like any other theory, rests on distinctions that are basal to it. This, after all, means giving a super-theory an open flank, namely the basic interchangeability of its guiding distinctions. Thus a style of theory emerges which takes into account the self-reference of the theory."

If I claim that in Brigitte's [Brigitte Lassnig's] eyes there are lovely little angels cavorting about, this might work as a suggestion of flirtation, but hardly as an assertion of fact that would probably lead me to a state clinic or to drug screening."

And if we want to conceive of the psychic as a system of meaning, there is no choice: the psychic system is also difference, not a locative thing, not something that is somehow self-localizable. It is important for our further work here to mark this point quite sharply: The psychic system is not alive, it is not made of cells and organic molecules. It is not the brain or the neuronal system, however much it depends on this infrastructure."
