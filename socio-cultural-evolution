It has therefore \"invented\" for more complex organisms the abbreviation mechanism of procreation, birth and death, which mediates at the same time the selection and stabilization achievements on the level of higher complexity, but, as one knows today, is without influence on the variation chance. The expectability of evolutionary changes is thus based on statistical probabilities, not on a plan and also not on purposeful control. Thus, organic evolution is and remains bound to the law of large numbers, and this limits the complexity of individual systems that can be achieved at its level.\n"

But its selection mechanism *can [[choose]] not only among the real, but also among the possible*. It does not presuppose that the selection field already exists, i.e. is already created by mutative variation and is then destroyed again or exceptionally preserved; but it presents in the form of meaning at the same time a field of possible subsequent selections, i.e. real possibilities, among which one can choose without having to realize first everything that can be chosen. This avoids unnecessary production detours. At the same time, a considerable acceleration is achieved. The further course as well as the speed of socio-cultural evolution are therefore essentially determined by what real possibilities are at disposal (according to what we had explained above in chapter 1.5 about increasing the complexity of the possible).\n"

Thus, sociocultural evolution as evolution becomes *type-dependent* (which, contrary to earlier assumptions, organic evolution is not). Type-dependent means that the further development becomes dependent on conditions of functional and structural compatibility in the evolving system (and not only: in the reproduction mechanism), that in other words the structural type of individual systems is decisive for whether and in which direction there is further evolution.\n"

The phase of high culture is reached only in few, countable cases with a high degree of individualization. The world society forming today is a single social system. The socio-cultural evolution consequently amounts in the end to *evolution in one case*. The small number, finally the singular number, must therefore be immanently compensable in its disadvantage by meaning. That this was possible for territorial societies of the old style is proven by the symbolic formations which have carried the breakthrough to the bourgeois society and thus to the world society. **For the world society itself, for the critical question of further evolution in one instance, the proof of the possibility is pending.**\n"

The criterion of evolution, increase of complexity, thus becomes – if not a goal, at least – a functional condition of its mechanisms. In meaningful experience and action time can appear as horizon and thus evolution can be understood and projected as context of selections; it becomes conceivable, for example, to create structural conditions for chances of success of random variations. Evolution now no longer presupposes itself blindly in the meaning of evolutionary already achieved levels of organization of matter as differential condition of further evolution; it implies itself in the horizon of its own selectivity as condition of the change of its own possibilities.\n"

In all differences between organic and sociocultural evolution it can be seen that this new possibility was not dependent on immediate perfection, but could build up gradually: Unnecessity of chance variation does not exclude the use of chance; the possibility to choose among the possible does not exclude the possibility to choose among the real; the reduction of the number of stabilizing systems does not require the immediate reduction to one; and socio-cultural evolution does not depend on immediate self-thematization, but can use its own progress as illustrative material in such a way that instead of evolution first system history becomes conscious. **After consolidation of the world society, however, the question will arise whether the unity of the evolving system does not make all intermediate solutions obsolete and if one wants further evolution, one must also [[plan]] it.**"
