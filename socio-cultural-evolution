It is this level of enabling conditions on which organic and sociocultural evolution, on which proteins and [[Meaning]] ultimately differ. The fine regulation of mutative processes relates exclusively to those small systems which carry the specific function of genetic reproduction, and thus exclusively to a specific gene environment inside the cell. It is coincidental with regard to the persistence of organisms. In this respect, since organic evolution is based on blind, imitative variation, it relies on large numbers and/or long periods of time. It has therefore \"invented\" for more complex organisms the abbreviation mechanism of procreation, birth and death, which mediates at the same time the selection and stabilization achievements on the level of higher complexity, but, as one knows today, is without influence on the variation chance. The expectability of evolutionary changes is thus based on statistical probabilities, not on a plan and also not on purposeful control. Thus, organic evolution is and remains bound to the law of large numbers, and this limits the complexity of individual systems that can be achieved at its level.\n"
