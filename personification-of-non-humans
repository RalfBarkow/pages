(2) But there is no compelling reason to restrict the attribution of action exclusively to humans and to social systems, as [[Niklas Luhmann]] argues. Personifying other nonhumans is a social reality today and a political necessity for the future. (3) The admission of actors does not take place, as [[Bruno Latour]] suggests, into one and only one collective. Rather, the properties of new actors differ extremely according to the multiplicity of different sites of the political ecology."
