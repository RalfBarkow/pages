One of the main concerns is that it can lead to disengagement and a lack of interest in learning, as students may find the material boring or irrelevant to their lives. It can also limit students' ability to develop critical thinking skills and to apply the knowledge they learn in real-world contexts.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a shift towards more student-centered, [[Active  Learning]] approaches that emphasize engagement and participation.
