This is slow and inefficient, both because you have to take your hands from your keyboard and because repeatedly pressing backspace takes time. The more time you spend pressing keys, the more time and energy is wasted.\n\nTo speed up editing, many editors use key chords for common editing tasks: Control-c for copying and so on. However, these types of shortcuts tend to have two problems. First, you have to press two keys at the same time, which is harder to coordinate and thus slower than pressing keys in a sequence. Second, you typically have to use your weakest fingers (pinkies) extensively and bend your wrists in unergonomic positions, which is uncomfortable for many and risks developing carpal tunnel syndrome in the long run.\n\nBy contrast, Spacemacs uses modal editing. Modal editing means that different modes are used for editing and writing text. While this can sound complicated at first, in practice it can be learned quickly and once learned is unparallelled in speed and ergonomy. Our earlier example of deleting a certain line of text (a very common edit task) can be achieved in Spacemacs by simply navigating to the line in question with the keys j and k (navigation keys) and pressing d (for \"delete\") two times!\n\nYou might have noticed that this was achieved entirely without moving your fingers from your home row (the row where your fingers lie in rest when touch-typing) and without using modifier keys."
