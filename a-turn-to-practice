Of course, it makes sense that this kind of cultural development should be occurring in post-Fordism, as a ‘knowledge based’ form of economy. But it remains somewhat esoteric, geeky or academic (not to mention counter-intuitive and conceptually ‘hard’, much of the time) and its perceptions and intuitions currently aren’t well translated into the aesthetics of activist culture.\n"
