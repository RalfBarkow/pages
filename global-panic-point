In 2018, he was appointed to the European Commission's High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence. In 2009 he published the bestseller \"The Ego Tunnel\", and recently his book \"Consciousness Culture - Spirituality, Intellectual Probity and the Planetary Crisis\" was published (Berlin Verlag). In the podcast \"Ethik Digital\" he talks with Christine Ulrich and Rieke C. Harmsen about consciousness, suffering and what digitalization is doing to our thinking and feeling."
