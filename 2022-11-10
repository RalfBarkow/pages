Bayern‚Äôs demonstration coincided with the development of ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù online businesses that operate independently of their human owners‚Äîaccepting payments in online currencies and contracting with human agents to perform the off-line aspects of their businesses.  About the same time, leading technologists Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking said that they regard human-level artificial intelligence as an existential threat to the human race.\n"

To pursue incubation and patenting would require funds that we currently do not have. We are still convinced that Pile is a valuable and viable idea - but probably an idea whose time has not yet come. To get it beyond the point of a good idea and beyond the idiosyncrasies of its maverick inventor takes a lot more effort than we could afford.\nThis site will remain active as an archive for anyone interested in the technology and its history.

Although person and invoice data seem to be two separate \"things\", in a Pile they are the same, because they are part of the same and a connection exists (or at least can exists) between the two. Connectedness makes unity and overcomes separation. The same you could say about a person and a car: they seem to be separate, independent entities ‚Äì but on a lower (or higher? ;-) level they are not. They distinction between the person here and the car there is only for practical reasons; \"in reality\" they are connected by several means (gravity, a looong \"chain\" of elementary particles and their forces, and maybe other means). Separation thus is always a matter of\nviewpoint and purpose. And Pile allows you to assume at any time any viewpoint. A RDBMS on the other hand forces you to define a set of possible viewpoints by laying out a database schema. Pile frees you from that."

        "text": "How would you explain Pile to a Buddhist?\nHm... Even though I don‚Äôt know how Pile could help humanity more than relational databases or a visual development environment for software or other tools or advances in computer science, it‚Äôs an interesting challenge to explain Pile to a Buddhist. Let me try it this way:\n\nWhat you could tell your friend is, that Pile could be viewed as standing in the tradition of eastern philosophies and religions or maybe a mystical view of the universe. Relational databases on the hand could be viewed as standing in the tradition of western thinking. How‚Äôs that?\n\n(Have a look at this paper for a difference between RDBMS and Pile:\nhttp://www.pilesys.com/new/Documents/Freeingdatafromthesilos-Pileexplained.pdf )\n\nWestern thinking so far favors decomposition and parts. Western thinking is based on separation.\n\nEastern thinking (at least as we view it in the western world ;-) favors a holistic view on the universe. Eastern thinking is based on union, non-separation.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs what Pile does: Pile views the world as a whole. In a Pile, anything can be connected with anything. There might be islands of separation, but they are not fundamental. Any island can be connected with any other at any time. Pile explicitly says, there is not one way of arranging information, but any, because any information (or piece of data) can be part of any context.\n\nAlso Pile does not favor any level of aggregation/abstraction over any other. There is no difference between the tiniest practical part of information and the largest aggregate or most abstract concept. All is the same. Like in your mind: There is not real difference between the universe and a computer. Both are represented in the same basic way in your brain.\nSo any difference you make between the two is voluntary and arbitrary.\n\nThe same is true for Pile. As useful as separations might be in daily life (I‚Äôm here, over there is a car coming towards me, so I better hurry up), in the end they are arbitrary and only of temporary value. They are not fundamental and absolute. Thus in Pile it depends on an observer what to view as an entity and where to draw a boundary. On a more fundamental level though, this boundary does not exist in a Pile.\n\nWhen Jesus said (in the non-canonical gospel of Thomas) \"Wherever you turn a stone I‚Äôm there\" he alluded to the unity of everything and the connectedness of everything. (You probably could say, that he even transcends the term \"everything\" because it contains the notion of thing which stands for separateness.)\n\nYou could say, Pile implements this for information we \"pour\" into it. Wherever you pick a relation in a Pile you have the whole in your hand. That does not mean, all information is in a single relation, but a single relation is all you can get at - ever. So a relation (or a worm under a stone) is not more or less than a customer database or a human being. And a relation in a Pile representing anything can be connected with everything else.\n\nBottom line: Pile represents a thinking of \"No separation!\" All‚Äôs the same, everything can be connected. Pile is about unity through connectedness. Although person and invoice data seem to be two separate \"things\", in a Pile they are the same, because they are part of the same and a connection exists (or at least can exists) between the two. Connectedness makes unity and overcomes separation. The same you could say about a person and a car: they seem to be separate, independent entities - but on a lower (or higher? ;-) level they are not. They distinction between the person here and the car there is only for practical reasons; \"in reality\" they are connected by several means (gravity, a looong \"chain\" of elementary particles and their forces, and maybe other means). Separation thus is always a matter of\nviewpoint and purpose. And Pile allows you to assume at any time any viewpoint. A RDBMS on the other hand forces you to define a set of possible viewpoints by laying out a database schema. Pile frees you from that.\n"
