They can condition ego’s motivation through alter’s selection. The criteria for the coupling of selections function to motivate ego to accept alter’s selection. Thus, symbolically generalized media combine selection and motivation, and thereby make it probable that alter’s selection is accepted as the basis of ego’s further selections. The concepts of “acceptance” and “motivation” do not refer to ego’s psychic system. Acceptance and motivation are not observed as mental states, because the psychic conditions of acceptance and motivation are unknown. Rather, one can observe that a symbolically generalized medium enables the strict coupling of ego’s and alter’s selections through the specific form of the medium [→[[Medium/Form]]]. Both ego and alter know and accept that their selections are conditioned by the symbolically generalized medium. For instance, ego accepts alter’s command to pay a fine because alter exercises power; ego accepts alter’s claims that the earth orbits the sun because it concerns scientific truth; ego accepts alter’s suggestion to spend the evening together because she loves alter.\n"

Generalization means treating a plurality of references as a unity: the →[[meaning]] of a specific communication is not exhausted in the communication itself, but rather condenses into a unitary form that participants can refer to in other situations, at other points in time and with other communication partners. The generalization of the medium occurs through symbols that allow the formation of its unity from a plurality of references. Thanks to this symbolic generalization, the form of the medium can become universally applicable (love is love regardless of the identity of the partners, the circumstances of meeting, the history of the relationship) and regulate every specific situation, but without determining it (one can love differently, depending on the partner, circumstances or relationship history).

Selections can be attributed as actions (utterances) or as experiences (information): symbolically generalized media are differentiated according to whether ego and alter are observed in regard to their actions or experiences. The differentiation of symbolically generalized media is based on the coupling of alter’s selections and ego’s selections, which are attributed as action or experience. These forms of attribution allow the asymmetrization of →[[double contingency]] and the enhancement of communication, which can flow from alter to ego. They direct the conditioning of selection: when a selection is clearly attributed to the system (alter’s action) or its environment (alter’s experience), ego can be motivated to base her own action or experience on this selection.\n\n"

In this transition, the symbolically generalized media worked as catalysts in the formation of some functional systems (the political system, the economic system, the scientific system, the system of families, the art system), in which the success of communication depended on the distinction between acceptance and rejection. The symbolically generalized media ensure operational closure and unity of these functional systems. They are absent in functional systems specialized in the communicative treatment of the environment (psychic systems, body, horizons of transcendental meaning), because these systems do not refer to the primary problem of improbable success of communication. In these conditions, either a code referring directly to the function [→[[Religious System]]] develops, or the interaction system plays an important function in ensuring the probability of acceptance [→[[Education System]]]."
