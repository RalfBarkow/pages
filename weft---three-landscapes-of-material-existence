Each map has three elements . .\n- **Dramatis personae** - The enduring 'things' and forms that constitute structure in the landscape, and function as actors, or resources, or places where action occurs.\n- **Process map** - The dominant, central processes that constitute the dynamics in the landscape: how transformation occurs, which transformations occur, how readily they occur.\n- **Characteristic behaviours** - In a map-for-activism, the characteristic behaviours are those that are anticipated in the transformed system of practice - that is, the transformed fabric of forces of production (FoP). In foprop, these are specified in terms of RoP (relations of production) - both dominant RoP in the present, and intended RoP that characterise the prefigurative and transformed fabric of forces of production.\n"
