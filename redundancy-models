For this reason, too, they must be distinguished from non-phonetic scripts. On the other hand, any form of written fixation of communication enables the distinction between the recursivity of observations and the recursivity of operations, and in this way leads to the formation of its own structures. In the absence of an accomplished phonetism, recursivity inevitably remains context-bound and cannot yet include the distinction of the level of words from the level of objects (the self-reference and foreign-reference of communication); it nevertheless leads to an \"accumulation\" of observations and thus to an influence on communication, which in the course of time becomes more and more presuppositional. richer in the course of time. What communication observes, that is, what is talked about, is therefore anything but simple-minded and structured according to forms that are context-dependent but by no means exclusively taken from the context. This is already sufficient to be able to assume an independent memory."
