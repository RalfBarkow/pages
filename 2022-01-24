After decades of development in programming languages and programming environments, Smalltalk is still one of few environments that provide advanced features and is still widely used in the industry. However, as Java became prevalent, the ability to call Java code from Smalltalk and vice versa becomes important. Traditional approaches to integrate the Java and Smalltalk languages are through low-level communication between separate Java and Smalltalk virtual machines. We are not aware of any attempt to execute and integrate the Java language directly in the Smalltalk environment. A direct integration allows for very tight and almost seamless integration of the languages and their objects within a single environment. Yet integration and language interoperability impose challenging issues related to method naming conventions, method overloading, exception handling and thread-locking mechanisms.\n>\n> In this paper we describe ways to overcome these challenges and to integrate Java into the Smalltalk environment. Using techniques described in this paper, the programmer can call Java code from Smalltalk using standard Smalltalk idioms while the semantics of each language remains preserved. We present STX:LIBJAVA --- an implementation of Java virtual machine within Smalltalk/X --- as a validation of our approach.\n"

The design and implementation of a software system is often governed by a variety of coding conventions, design patterns, architectural guidelines, design rules, and other so-called structural regularities. To prevent a deterioration of the system’s source code, it is important that these regularities are verified and enforced upon evolution of the system. The Intensional Views Environment (IntensiVE), presented in this article, is a tool suite for specifying relevant structural regularities in an (object-oriented) software system and verifying them against the current and later versions of the system. At the heart of the IntensiVE tool suite are (logic) program queries and the model of intensional views and relations, through which regularities are expressed. Upon verification of these regularities in the source code of the system, IntensiVE reports the code entities (i.e. classes, methods, variables, statements, etc.) that violate these constraints. We present IntensiVE and illustrate its application to the verification of an Abstract Factory design pattern in the implementation of a software system."

        "text": "Regulation of Environmental Deterioration,” Hawk, D.L., Dissertation, Social Systems Sciences Program, University of Pennsylvania, 1979. The thesis was that environmental deterioration resulted from an inability to appreciate context. This was because social systems have become addicted to use of an analytic frame of partial thought. The most worrisome aspect of the resulting dilemma was that the same analytical model\nthat had created the situation was now being used to resolve it. The situation was doubly damned by then being formalized and institutionalized via a legal system that was designed for stable environments. The recommendation from the work was to move from the “legal order” model, that values stability, to a negotiated order approach, that embraces dynamics."

        "text": "> **Abstract**. After decades of development in programming languages and programming environments, Smalltalk is still one of few environments that provide advanced features and is still widely used in the industry. However, as Java became prevalent, the ability to call Java code from Smalltalk and vice versa becomes important. Traditional approaches to integrate the Java and Smalltalk languages are through low-level communication between separate Java and Smalltalk virtual machines. We are not aware of any attempt to execute and integrate the Java language directly in the Smalltalk environment. A direct integration allows for very tight and almost seamless integration of the languages and their objects within a single environment. Yet integration and language interoperability impose challenging issues related to method naming conventions, method overloading, exception handling and thread-locking mechanisms.\n>\n> In this paper we describe ways to overcome these challenges and to integrate Java into the Smalltalk environment. Using techniques described in this paper, the programmer can call Java code from Smalltalk using standard Smalltalk idioms while the semantics of each language remains preserved. We present STX:LIBJAVA --- an implementation of Java virtual machine within Smalltalk/X --- as a validation of our approach.\n"

        "text": "> **Abstract**. The design and implementation of a software system is often governed by a variety of coding conventions, design patterns, architectural guidelines, design rules, and other so-called structural regularities. To prevent a deterioration of the system’s source code, it is important that these regularities are verified and enforced upon evolution of the system. The Intensional Views Environment (IntensiVE), presented in this article, is a tool suite for specifying relevant structural regularities in an (object-oriented) software system and verifying them against the current and later versions of the system. At the heart of the IntensiVE tool suite are (logic) program queries and the model of intensional views and relations, through which regularities are expressed. Upon verification of these regularities in the source code of the system, IntensiVE reports the code entities (i.e. classes, methods, variables, statements, etc.) that violate these constraints. We present IntensiVE and illustrate its application to the verification of an Abstract Factory design pattern in the implementation of a software system."

We are porting a turtle geometry editor from a previous jQuery-based implementation to a modern ES6 implementation. In our most recent branch we have a proof-of-concept that our editor can save geometry into the memory of a seran-wiki outpost where it can be included in a node-based wiki and forked into the wider federation."

        "text": "p. 334 Both types of linguistic building blocks can be used in isolation or together to transform a stream of input data (e.g., sensor data) into an output data stream that can be used in turn as input by another brick. This is similar in spirit to how a Unix/Linux shell command can be piped to another command. A major advantage of the streams programming model is that control flow is implicit. Programs using streams are naturally concise, and the building blocks can easily be recombined to solve new problems."
