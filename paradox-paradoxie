One such case is the reflec- tionof subsystems in modern society. In the case of science, the distinction of the scientific code can be applied to itself, landing it in Epimenides’ para- dox: the distinction true/untrue observes itself with the paradoxical result that the possibility for further observations is blocked in the way described above. This problem arises in all functionally differentiated subsystems. The legal system, which operates on the basis of the distinction between who is juridically right and who is wrong, finds itself confronted with a paradoxical situation when it questions whether it has the right to determine who is right and who is not. The question cannot be answered, since any answer (e.g., so- cial contract, original act of violence that is justified by the actions that follow it) inevitably affects both sides of the distinction so that the problem becomes unsolvable. Similar examples can be given for all codes belonging to the sub- systems and the →symbolically generalized media: when the observation is di- rected at the same binary schematization that the observation itself employs, the system must indicate the unity of the distinction that it is currently us- ing—with paradoxical consequences. Every self-referential system capable of negation is therefore unable to establish exclusively self-observations, since self-observation can never be complete. In order to be complete, it should also be able to observe the distinction that it uses, and that is not possible [→Operation/Observation].\n"

This is paradoxical because the system must distinguish itself from an environment that does not belong to it, whilst simultaneously observing that this environment is nothing but an internal product of its own operations.
