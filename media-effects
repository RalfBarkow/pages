The effect of the printing press may be seen as the enabling of the nation-state (Anderson, 1983) or of functional differentiation (Luhmann); semiotic effects of media are, for example, thematized in conversations about media violence, which often presuppose a more or less immediate link between media representations and social behavior. Depending on how strong the link is thought to be, the phrase *media effects* conveys a tight, often causal coupling between the source and its origin."

      "text": "Media theory in the tradition of [[Fritz Heider]]’s conception of media as a loosely coupled substance suggests a different relationship between a medium and its effects: the medium is seen as a provider of loosely coupled elements that opens up a broad horizon of possible connections. A medium is thus regarded as structured potentiality, materiality of its own. However, that materiality was not thought of in terms of classical materialism, seeing materiality as something fixed and solid. What defines Heider’s materiality of the medium is precisely its looseness. It is important not to simply reduce this materiality to its elements, but to understand looseness as its defining structural characteristic. From this perspective the media and social effects of looseness take center stage. Looseness is not a deficiency (as in a *loose screw*), but a precondition for establishing connections, networks, and social systems. "

Looseness is no longer primarily the precondition for the construction of forms, but it becomes a form itself as the case of modularity exemplified. This leads us to a new understanding of mediatization: Mediatization means neither that the mass media colonize other spheres of society, nor that a particular medium of distribution (Verbreitungsmedium) is predominant. Rather, it means that looseness itself is being applied as structuring mechanism—and that this process does not happen by itself but requires the work of loosening, the establishment of technologies of loosening, and struggles about the normative and political potential of looseness."
