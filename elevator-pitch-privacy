He relates that at least one retirement community employee, who reported a similar incident, was chided by supervisors and colleagues who didn&apos;t believe her claims that the elevator spoke."

A web search for &quot;elevator telephone products&quot; reveals numerous 3rd party offerings. Your lift might be listening, possibly matching voice prints for law enforcement, surveillance, or monetizing the conversation."
