On Tieba, a platform for internet forums run by the internet company Baidu, he wrote that he had not been doing any real work for more than two years and had only been enjoying himself ever since. \"Nothing about it feels wrong,\" the 31-year-old said. He had cut back on his activities to the point where he needed only two meals a day, he said. As a result, he said, he has been able to reduce his food expenses to 200 renminbi a month; the equivalent of about 28 euros. He compared his new lifestyle to that of the Greek Cynic philosopher Diogenes of Sinope, who, according to tradition, used a barrel as a home. The contributions of the \"friendly traveler\" inspired many imitators and made \"lying flat\" a household word in a short time."

Because of the one-child policy imposed by the state in 1979, China's only children are under enormous pressure to perform. On the one hand, they are often treated like \"little emperors\" in the family; on the other hand, the entire hopes of the family rest on their shoulders. Society expects them to make a career for themselves, to enable the family to rise into the middle class and to acquire a certain amount of wealth as quickly as possible in order to be able to maintain a family of their own. For women, there is also the societal demand to marry early and have children - the government has now lifted the limit on the number of children in order to counteract the aging of society."

In 2019, China's GDP grew by just 6.1 percent – the lowest since 1990 – and the outbreak of the Covid 19 pandemic, subsequent lockdowns and supply chain bottlenecks have exacerbated these trends."

It is a silent non-cooperation movement without a leader. A poem that spread like wildfire in the chat groups of the short message service Wechat explains the philosophy of the movement: \"We lie flat so that we don't have to bend over backwards. We lie flat so we don't have to kneel down (in front of others). Lying flat is standing upright while horizontal. To lie flat is to have an upright spine.\""

At the end of May 2021, the state news agency Xinhua responded to the new trend with a video. Young people should not lie flat but \"keep fighting,\" was the tenor of the piece, which featured an 86-year-old professor who still gets up at four in the morning and works up to twelve hours a day. In August, even President Xi felt compelled to take a stand against flat-lining. At a meeting of the Central Finance Commission, he said that to prevent \"lying flat,\" it was necessary to create more opportunities for advancement."

Now people no longer just lie flat, but also watch things \"rot\" ([[bai lan]]). During the lockdown in Shanghai, the phrase \"We are the last generation\" also made the rounds, with which a local resident protested against being forced into a quarantine facility. Many young people no longer seem to have any hope of improving their situation. This is bad news for a party that long based its rule on the idea that each generation was a little better off than the previous one."

Because of the one-child policy imposed by the state in 1979, China's only children are under enormous pressure to perform. On the one hand, they are often treated like \"little emperors\" in the family; on the other hand, the entire hopes of the family rest on their shoulders. Society expects them to make a career for themselves, to enable the family to rise into the middle class and to acquire a certain amount of wealth as quickly as possible in order to be able to maintain a family of their own. For women, there is also the societal demand to marry early and have children - the government has now lifted the limit on the number of children in order to counteract the aging of society."

It is a silent non-cooperation movement without a leader. A poem that spread like wildfire in the chat groups of the short message service Wechat explains the philosophy of the movement: \"We lie flat so that we don't have to bend over backwards. We lie flat so we don't have to kneel down (in front of others). Lying flat is standing upright while horizontal. To lie flat is to have an upright spine.\""

At the end of May 2021, the state news agency Xinhua responded to the new trend with a video. Young people should not lie flat but \"keep fighting,\" was the tenor of the piece, which featured an 86-year-old professor who still gets up at four in the morning and works up to twelve hours a day. In August, even President Xi felt compelled to take a stand against flat-lining. At a meeting of the Central Finance Commission, he said that to prevent \"lying flat,\" it was necessary to create more opportunities for advancement."
