In successful applications of the transformation, the chains of centers which it generates sometimes have considerable length and are anchored in the space on either side of the original “hard” edge by gradients of size, color, contrast, or other variables that vary with distance from the edge.\n\nThis transformation acts as an instruction to soften the hardness of an edge that defines a center. It can sometimes be very complicated. This transformation does not have a particular outcome: it rather defines a range of possible actions, which may all have the effect described above."
