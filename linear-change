He discusses the learning theory that explains why computers can be such powerful catalysts for change in education, in particular, how intuitive knowledge is the platform on which students build scientific understanding. He also discusses the material and social reasons for the computer’s potential and argues for ‘two-way literacies,’ where everyone is a creator as well as consumer of dynamic and interactive expressive forms.
