        "text": "> This was in early 1967, and while we were pondering the FLEX machine, Utah was visited by Doug Engelbart. A prophet of Biblical dimensions, he was very much one of the fathers of what on the FLEX machine I had started to call \"personal computing.\" He actually traveled with his own 16mm projector with a remote control for starting and stopping it to show what was going on (people were not used to seeing and following cursors back then). His notion on the ARPA dream was that the destiny of oNLine Systems (NLS) was the \"augmentation of human intellect\" via an interactive vehicle navigating through \"**thought vectors in concept space.**\" What his system could do then—even by today's standards—was incredible. Not just hypertext, but graphics, multiple panes, efficient navigation and command input, interactive collaborative work, etc. An entire conceptual world and world view. The impact of this vision was to produce in the minds of those who were \"eager to be augmented\" a compelling metaphor of what interactive computing should be like, and I immediately adopted many of the ideas for the FLEX machine.
