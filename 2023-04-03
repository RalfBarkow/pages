Rather, Jesus' claim to be the Son of God meets a situation in which he promises to overcome a crisis in which people want to rediscover their general coherence, a unity and truth that allows them to come to terms with their fear; a fear that has been inherent in them since they left tribal societies, and which in the Old Testament is indissolubly linked to the concept of original sin: the fear of having to recognize that a unity other than the one their mortal body offers them does not in fact exist. With Jesus, conceived as the Son of God, they were able to place themselves in a unity that promised redemption to their torments of soul."

As the most urgent needs are for food and clothing, cattle, rice, fish, horses, sheep, furs, etc. were the products that historically acted as the first money. The development of economic life led to the fact that, over time, money became a product that satisfied less urgent needs. Such were the various metals – gold, silver, copper, from which a wide range of various consumer items (tools, jewelry, implements, etc.) were produced. Objective advantages of these metals, legitimate character of their allocation as money and rather regular use of ingots from these metals in calculations stipulated that from a certain moment of development of market relations the states began to make coins from them. Accordingly, prices of goods began to be expressed already not simply in quantity of the listed metals, but in quantity of these metals contained in the coins having the known form, a kind, weight, the name."

With regard to the objects not recognized as money by Keynes, one would not only have to think of the precious metal coins from property economies, which women from tribal societies sew on their headscarves, but also of the coins and banknotes of the former real socialism, which are considered real money by neoclassics and monetarists alike and yet were merely unspecified property rights certificates, behind which there was neither encumbered nor pledged property."

It means not only a harmless temporally meant \"to remind\", but also \"to admonish, to request, to talk to, to cause\" and so even \"to rebuke, to chastise\". The task of the contract witnesses to remind the debtors in time of their performance dates and to threaten the necessary consequences in case of delay, it clarifies the epithet moneta for the temple of Juno without difficulties. Correspondingly, monetalis does not only mean \"master of the mint\", but colloquially also \"the creditor who claims his debts\". Here it should be emphasized that not only - as already shown - the first mints were in private hands, but also did not disappear later: \"Coins were usually issued by the state, but sometimes they were signed by individuals, usually acting in the service of the state, but sometimes as private individuals. \""

He supposes that their \"cover\" was \"founded in a portion of meat\". Since, as an evolutionist, the temple is known to him only as a sacred place of sacrifice, but not as a great owner and witness of contracts between private creditors and debtors, his covering of flesh for a temple money seems only logical. What remains important about his observation is that he understands the intrinsic 'worthlessness' of these objects and is thus forced to search for something that represents real value."

Of him it is said that he \"was the first man to strike coins (and did so) in Aegina. For the coins spent he drew in the spits.\" Strabo adds that Pheidon invented the \"measures and weights called pheidonian, and struck both money coins of one kind and of silver.\" As a silver coin, the Aeginetan obolos weighs just 1.04 grams. Iron spits (oboloi) of 73.8 kilos excavated in the Argivian Temple of Hera weighed about 74.8 kilos each, if estimated corrosion losses are added. Six oboloi coins resulted in a drachma of 6.24 grams. The real iron spike thus yielded 12,000 iron drachms or 72,000 iron oboloi in coin currency. Since Pheidon is said to have determined the silver value to the iron value in the ratio of 400:1 and according to the sources coined silver and money of the \"other kind\", there were for a real iron spike silver coins in the value of 180 oboloi or 30 drachmas or in the weight of 187.2 grams of silver. The money of the other kind was - as Keynes probably rightly concluded - the well-known Peleponnesian iron money, which also no longer had a spit form and weighed 416 grams in its smallest unit - the iron oboloi.

Therefore, for him, \"the supposition of many authors, that where there were no coins, real exchange prevailed, is far from the truth.\" The money proper has namely no goods to be exchanged, but the money of account from an interest-bearing creditor-debtor contract as a precondition. With regard to the objects not recognized as money by Keynes, one would not only have to think of the precious metal coins from property economies, which women from tribal societies sew on their headscarves, but also of the coins and banknotes of the former real socialism, which are considered real money by neoclassics and monetarists alike and yet were merely unspecified property rights certificates, behind which there was neither encumbered nor pledged property."

Moneten, Münze etc. became coining. This temple became Roman mint. Money was minted with its dies. Why the verb monere entered the temple name gives the real difficulties of understanding. It means not only a harmless temporally meant \"to remind\", but also \"to admonish, to request, to talk to, to cause\" and so even \"to rebuke, to chastise\". The task of the contract witnesses to remind the debtors in time of their performance dates and to threaten the necessary consequences in case of delay, it clarifies the epithet moneta for the temple of Juno without difficulties. Correspondingly, monetalis does not only mean \"master of the mint\", but colloquially also \"the creditor who claims his debts\". Here it should be emphasized that not only - as already shown - the first mints were in private hands, but also did not disappear later: \"Coins were usually issued by the state, but sometimes they were signed by individuals, usually acting in the service of the state, but sometimes as private individuals. \""

Since, as an evolutionist, the temple is known to him only as a sacred place of sacrifice, but not as a great owner and witness of contracts between private creditors and debtors, his covering of flesh for a temple money seems only logical. What remains important about his observation is that he understands the in trinsic 'worthlessness' of these objects and is thus forced to search for something that represents real value."

Of him it is said that he \"was the first man to strike coins (and did so) in Aegina. For the coins spent he drew in the spits.\" Strabo adds that Pheidon invented the \"measures and weights called pheidonian, and struck both money coins of one kind and of silver.\" As a silver coin, the Aeginetan obolos weighs just 1.04 grams. Iron spits (oboloi) of 73.8 kilos excavated in the Argivian Temple of Hera weighed about 74.8 kilos each, if estimated corrosion losses are added.

Since Pheidon is said to have determined the silver value to the iron value in the ratio of 400:1 and according to the sources coined silver and money of the \"other kind\", there were for a real iron spike silver coins in the value of 180 oboloi or 30 drachmas or in the weight of 187.2 grams of silver.

Of the state bank of the GDR, the following then applied logically: \"Its claims consisted quite predominantly of liabilities of public budgets, liabilities of the production companies and of the administrations of the housing industry. These were all irredeemable claims - at least in the short term, but predominantly also in the long term - i.e. they had to be valued at zero.\" The socialist banknotes were merely instruments with which the state bank had to enable the authorities to allocate resources and have them used in the meaning of the goals of the central goods planning authority."
