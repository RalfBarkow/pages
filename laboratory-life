The films show that these activities are far from mundane, but are the main vehicals for equity, humility, accountability, and the creation of a lab collective. Our goal: to do science differently, in ways that do not replicate existing power dynamics. While the methods in the [[Laboratory Life]] series will not always be directly replicable in other labs, we hope that their spirit is transferable.\n\nAlso: these methods are intellectual products of CLEAR.
