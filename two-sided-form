It is this version of the concept of form to which the characteristic form figures discussed in this article are related. They are formed by replacing the letters that can be written under or next to the cross-hooks (also called \"Quere\") in the Laws of Form with normal language words. The forms or arrangements of forms obtained in this way partly reproduce exemplary formulas of the Laws of Form, but complex – even \"crooked\" (Baecker 2021) – form notations are also common, which have emancipated themselves from the formulas introduced in the Laws of Form and seem to go their own way in a way that has yet to be investigated."
