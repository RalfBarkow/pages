She returned to the UK to join Rare, a diversity recruitment company, as a research analyst working on the Contextual Recruitment System (CRS). Her role focused on gathering and processing data to be used as input to the CRS, and analysing data on candidate applications and success rates from clients who had been using the system in its first year. She presented this research at Clifford Chance in London, demonstrating the positive impact that the technology had had on the success rates of disadvantaged candidates. When Rare was asked to build the CRS for an Australian firm, Allens, Gjeta led the research, and travelled to Sydney to launch the system itself and train senior recruiters in using the technology and interpreting the contextualised candidate information it could provide."
