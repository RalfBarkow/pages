Man has a part in both worlds (in the world of ideas thanks to his soul, in the world of reality through his sensory perceptions) and he has the task, through the use of the reason given to him thanks to his participation in the ideas, to behave in such a way that the order in this world (and Plato always means: the political one) comes as close as possible to the ideal state given by reason. On this basis, Plato develops a sophisticated doctrine of virtue, the practice of which is to ensure that the conflicting tendencies in the coexistence of human beings come together to form a reasonable unity: a *truth*."

In money the unity of being and becoming takes place. In the exchange of commodities a movement of things takes place, which in the course of this movement must be assumed to be spared any change, to which all things are in reality always subject. And the reference point of these opposites of being and becoming is a unity which is completely abstract, is value, which, however, appears empirically in money as something which does not occur in this form in nature, or even in man himself. The reflection of philosophers, of course, continues to take place outside money, their concepts also continue to lead a life of their own, and yet they grasp the world in precisely the way in which money reproduces itself in the real world.
