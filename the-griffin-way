At times it was a hard slog, but we were propelled from within by purpose, our collective vision and the unique opportunity we’d each been given – the chance to build something extraordinary from the ground up. A chance to rewrite the story of school."

Staff greeted each learner at the door, excited for the adventure ahead to finally begin. ‘Tea and Tissues’ at the Resource Centre welcomed caregivers with open, supportive arms post drop-off; a chance to connect and forge relationships."

Getting in and helping out, doing more than your bit, and noticing a colleague in need is just part of 'the Griffin Way'. Through pitching in and collectively building our new school community, we’d stumbled across a second family – our Griffin family. "

The Griffin Way is a state of being, a way of operating, a thought process, a set of [[Normative Behaviors]]; a critical element of our powerful school culture. It aligns vision with action and signifies our community coming together, no matter the cause. "
