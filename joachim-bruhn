His early realization that there was no way around a (social) revolution in favor of the free association of people initially led him to join one of the K-groups in Freiburg. But party formation, state fetishism, Marxism-Leninism or Maoism were nothing that could hold him as a free spirit for long. Trained more and more in the late Marx and in critical theory, the class struggle droning of the left-wing radicals and the voluntarism of the alternative movement became just as repugnant to him as the realpolitik turn of many K-groups toward power, such as the Greens."

Within a few years, the ISF became the most intellectually exciting place in Freiburg, with a great impact on the entire German-speaking ideology critique.

The same applies to the Ça ira publishing house, which Jochen co-founded and which is still one of the top addresses for publications critical of ideology. Thanks in no small part to Jochen's editorial efforts, the publishing house took on with particular verve little-known or once again forgotten theorists beyond the dogmatic ML canon, from Agnoli to Sohn-Rethel."

There was virtually no theorist he did not know and was able to eloquently criticize or add to, whether it was about Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism, Trotskyism, anarchism or social democracy. Those who got involved could learn a lot from him, although he had no ambitions to be a teacher and hated the university as a producer of ideology. He was far too uncompromising, undiplomatic, and above all far too critical of any form of ideology formation, especially academic ideology, for a university career. But anyone who wanted to know, for example, what distinguishes value critique from class sociology and why capital, the state, and ideology formation must be thought not only in enlightenment dialectical terms, but also in negative dialectical terms, found in Jochen a witty, stimulating mentor. It is no coincidence that many authors from the environment of critical media such as Jungle World, konkret, Phase 2, sans phrase and also the iz3w referred to him. His writings, lectures and discussions were formative for an entire generation of ideology critics."
