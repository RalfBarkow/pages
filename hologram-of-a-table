If we want to remain in the picture, then we must bend ourselves (and the picture in which we are) à la Möbius. (p. 201)"

The making of alternative worlds of things by computation has not yet been fully achieved, but we are on the threshold of it. Therefore, the distinction between image and thing, between fiction and reality, becomes more and more inoperational, especially since the so-called \"reality\" - in the meaning of \"perceived world\" - exhibits itself as a computation. Instead, a distinction has to be made between \"concrete\" and \"abstract\": […] (p. 19)"

All should categories like \"good\" and \"bad\", \"beautiful\" and \"ugly\", however, will apply to the new technology. In this meaning it will be approximately what was called \"art\" in modern times, and Nietzsche's sentence \"art is better than truth\" will only gain the radical meaning that is meant in it. The modern separation of technology and art, of \"hard\" and \"soft\" culture, will become meaningless, not because technology and art overlap, but because they will regain their pre-modern synonymity.

Therefore, the distinction between image and thing, between fiction and reality, becomes more and more inoperational, especially since the so-called \"reality\" - in the meaning of \"perceived world\" - exhibits itself as a computation.
