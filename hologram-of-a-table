This change in our thinking is interpreted by the cultural pessimists as a relapse into figurative, magical thinking. But in this they are mistaken. As far as they deserve the name \"image\" at all, the new synthetic images point to the opposite side of the traditional ones: the old images signify the world of things and/or the subject of this world of things, the new ones signify similarities, calculations. The old images are images of something, the new ones are projections, images of something that does not exist, but could exist. The old images are \"fictions\", \"simulations of\", the new ones are concretizations of [[Possibilities]]. The old images owe their existence to an abstracting, stepping back \"imagination\", the new ones to a concretizing, projecting \"imagination\". So we do not think imaginatively magically, but on the contrary imaginatively designing. (p. 25)"

If a hologram is to bend, it must reach into another dimension than the usual third. Since the outstretched, not yet fully human hand can reach for itself, for that not yet fully human hand which is searching for the fully human, it must be able to turn around itself, to bend comparable to a Möbius strip. If we want to remain in the picture, then we must bend ourselves (and the picture in which we are) à la Möbius. (p. 201)"

The photo is only the first step in the direction of a synthetic manufacturing of things from grains, the video, the hologram and the computer-controlled hologram are the further steps taken so far. The making of alternative worlds of things by computation has not yet been fully achieved, but we are on the threshold of it. Therefore, the distinction between image and thing, between fiction and reality, becomes more and more inoperational, especially since the so-called \"reality\" - in the meaning of \"perceived world\" - exhibits itself as a computation. Instead, a distinction has to be made between \"concrete\" and \"abstract\": […] (p. 19)"

        "text": "With the hologram, it makes no sense to want to consider it real or fictitious and its algorithms true or false. All should categories like \"good\" and \"bad\", \"beautiful\" and \"ugly\", however, will apply to the new technology. In this meaning it will be approximately what was called \"art\" in modern times, and Nietzsche's sentence \"art is better than truth\" will only gain the radical meaning that is meant in it. The modern separation of technology and art, of \"hard\" and \"soft\" culture, will become meaningless, not because technology and art overlap, but because they will regain their pre-modern synonymity.

The finer the grains and the denser the scattering, the more \"thing-like\", until a degree of scattering is reached, which corresponds to the production of a thing. The photo is only the first step in the direction of a synthetic manufacturing of things from grains, the video, the hologram and the computer-controlled hologram are the further steps taken so far. The making of alternative worlds of things by computation has not yet been fully achieved, but we are on the threshold of it. Therefore, the distinction between image and thing, between fiction and reality, becomes more and more inoperational, especially since the so-called \"reality\" - in the meaning of \"perceived world\" - exhibits itself as a computation. Instead, a distinction has to be made between \"concrete\" and \"abstract\": […] (p. 19)"
