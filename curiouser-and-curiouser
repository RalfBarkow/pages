Cultivating curiosity in our classrooms is a work in progress that is tracking along nicely, our practice maturing as we learn more. Through exploring [[Powerful Provocations]], we’ve found a common language in which to talk about how we provoke our learners’ curiosity, how we can foster the Alice. The more we learn, the more curious we get. Curiosity begets curiosity."
