The theory argues that the actions of one state to increase its security can trigger similar actions by other states, leading to a vicious cycle of mutual insecurity.\n\nThe Spiral Model asserts that even actions intended to increase security, such as increasing military capabilities or forming alliances, can be perceived as threatening by other states. This perception can then lead to countermeasures that further increase tensions and the risk of conflict."
