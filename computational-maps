When trying to model brain function in silico, we have the tendency to first understand and solve the specific problem at hand in our own head and then create specific circuits and devices accordingly. This approach has long dominated the venture of artificial intelligence, and certainly also the field of computer vision. However, what may in the brain act like a fixed device may be an artifact of standardized experimental conditions and may in reality be the result of spontaneous organization. The devices (algorithms) in our computers are created by a separate process, in the mind of programmers. For the brain, there is no independent programmer (and evolution should not lightly be invoked as such). For the brain, there is no clear-cut separation between generation and execution of “algorithms.” The interdigitated processes of evolution, ontogenesis, learning, brain state organization and, in the case of man at least, culture and education, are autonomously organizing the brain’s functionality. The work of science will only have been done once we understand the principles of organization that not only coordinate subsystems but also create them. Only these principles are fixed, what they produce may to a large extent be due to accidents and circumstances."
