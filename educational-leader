        "text": "Authentic leadership is employed as a conceptual framework and foundation for this special issue. Several of the articles (Walker and Chen; Stefkovich and Begley; Woods) critically examine authentic leadership as a theoretical concept derived from several foundational domains including psychology, sociology, education law and philosophy. The lead article by Starratt establishes the linkage between the authentic leader and school learning as a moral activity. The remaining articles (Branson; Langlois and Lapointe; Larusdottir; Norberg and Johansson) report on recently conducted research on moral leadership and the valuation processes of school administrators as well as their strategic responses to ethical dilemmas. The focus of the full issue is on a practice grounded approach to describing authentic leadership and the acquisition of moral literacy by school leaders."
