The company claims it is an all-in-one workspace for [[Notetaking software]], [[Knowledge management software]] and [[Spreadsheet]] management, and [[Project management software]]. It is described as a file management tool offering a unified workspace, allowing users to comment on ongoing projects, participate in discussions, and receive feedback. In addition to [[Cross-platform software]] apps, it can be accessed via most [[web browser]]s. It includes a tool for \"clipping\" content from webpages. It helps users schedule tasks, manage files, save documents, set reminders, keep agendas, organize their work. Notion allows writing & pasting equations in the form of blocks or inline, as it supports [[LaTex]].  Users can also [[wikt:embed]] online content in their Notion pages using Embed.ly. In this way notes can also be efficiently typed down alongside an embedded video playing in [[Picture-in-picture]] mode- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(productivity_software)#Software wikipedia]"
