In an ideal world I will lunge my horse before I ride him. Usually I connect the lunge rein to a head-collar without side reins but with my usual saddle and bridle. I secure the reins by twisting and threading through the throat-lash. I believe this gives a similar feel to an equilibrium contact on the bit (see chapter 5 for a discussion of rein contact). Sometimes I secure the stirrups and sometimes I let them hang at a height where they will not catch the horse’s elbow. The stirrups then encourage the horse forward as they follow the rhythm of his movement. ",
