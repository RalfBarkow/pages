The date/time and duration fields can get calculated wrong if switches, mediation and billing servers are not synchronized and provisioned with the appropriate logic leading to over or underbilling issues for customers. Ie a call started at 1:30AM local time just before cutover and finishing at 2:30AM (the actual customer may be 5 hours ahead so to them it is 7:30AM quite probable) and the clocks move forward the potential is that the CDR could record an [[End Time]] of 3:30AM because of faulty [[Timing History]].

Someone said \"[[Science Fiction]] is the first draft of the future\" we can imagine possible worlds long before we have the ability to participate in them. Obviously there were no genetic wars in the 90s so it won't happen exactly the same but it is likely if human civilization survives to expand beyond the solar system they will encounter [[Life On Other Planets]], a quasi-federation will be formed if one does not exist out there like in [[Star Trek]], and as more civilizations are encountered conflict, power struggles and their resolution will dominate as in [[Star Wars]] not unlike WWI and II when technology allowed many nations to simultaneously move men and materials and communicate rapidly on a global basis. Other possible futures are: an asteroid takes us out or (god forbid) we take ourselves out by nuclear holocast; Also a [[One World Government]] (1984/[[Brave New World]]) could emerge and stifle progress, or machines take over like in [[The Matrix]] but being an optimist the projection above is hopefully a best case scenario.

Other possible futures are: an asteroid takes us out or (god forbid) we take ourselves out by nuclear holocast; Also a [[One World Government]] (1984/[[Brave New World]]) could emerge and stifle progress, or machines take over like in [[The Matrix]] but being an optimist the projection above is hopefully a best case scenario.
