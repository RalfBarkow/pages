The strength of that epiphany echos through the decades. At the time I was completely blown away to create for myself my first working abstraction. One loop, a clever division of PI, and two instructions express what all regular polygons share. Behold a tool to create any of them! I glimpsed a hint of Newtonian infinitesimals as I created 30-sided, 90-sided, 270-sided polygons indistinguishable from circles. In years since, on top of that truth I have built the scaffolding of topology and of differential geometry."
