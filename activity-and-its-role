        "text": "For these authors, the activity of people is complex and modeling that activity is tricky. Robinson's chapter takes the view that models, procedures, and scenarios are \"tin ducks\" that keep coming back to haunt analysts of computerization. Many analysts, he notes, treat procedures as actions whose outcomes are specified in advance, analogous to the technical notion of algorithms: procedures that are guaranteed to terminate and return an answer. However, for Robinson, procedures do not necessarily exist independently of inquiries that people make about them.  Managing the outcome of a procedure also means managing the procedure through its life, and managing the meaning or interpretation of the outcome. There is in principle  no \"guaranteed outcome.\" **Useful human action is locally situated**, whereas procedures are not – they are decontextualized systems of instructions. "
