Dissent is only effective if it is structured in a way that contributes to the outcome. There are several ways to accomplish this. The powers that be could be receptive to your dissent. You could simply force your dissent (coup d'etat). You could just demonstrate your way is better by building it (the Hacker way). Or you could be convincing. ",

If your goal is simply to validate yourself and 'score points' rather than contribute value to the discussion, you will be ignored, since you are only trying to take value not give it. This is why providing a contrasting view is best done when teaching rather than berating, as your point is much more likely to be considered if it is seen to be helping the listener achieve their desired outcome. Conversely, opening a conversation with an attack is a sucker punch. This immediately destroys trust, which distorts the perception of value. It also distorts that actual value and point, as the unfocused anger will warp any discussion to absurdity. It takes at this point a strong person to read through all the unnecessary angry bullshit to get to the point, as well as a patient person to wait for the actual point, as well as an empathic person to read between the lines. We all know this.
