An inquiry stance is consciously woven into every aspect of our culture, a truly ubiquitous approach. "

As educators striving to embrace an inquiry stance, we appreciate that the work starts with us, our mindset. It is a complete mindset shift born out of transforming 'old story' beliefs about teaching and learning and replacing them with a 'new story'. It's about favouring voice, process, and intentionality. Above all else, curiosity is our linchpin. "

We are growing to shun the absolute and instead embrace and value possibilities. In everything we do, we deliberately ask, ponder, wonder, and talk about ideas - we are guided by our curiosity. In taking an inquiry stance, we are driven to embody inquiry as a way of thinking and being. Our behaviour is influenced by our transforming beliefs. As we ourselves become inquirers, we are better able to model and facilitate learning through inquiry in our classrooms. "

Our transformation starts with moving from [[Knowers to Learners]], with transforming our mindset, our stance. "

        "text": "Harnessing an inquiry stance influences the way we act both inside and outside the classroom at Griffin. We are growing to shun the absolute and instead embrace and value possibilities. In everything we do, we deliberately ask, ponder, wonder and talk about ideas - we are guided by our curiosity. In taking an inquiry stance, we are driven to embody inquiry as a way of thinking and being. Our behaviour is influenced by our transforming beliefs. As we ourselves become inquirers, we are better able to model and facilitate learning through inquiry in our classrooms. "

Through consciously cultivating a culture of inquiry at Griffin, we are all transformed. Reimagining the story of school starts with us. Our transformation starts with moving from [[Knowers to Learners]], with transforming our mindset, our stance. "
