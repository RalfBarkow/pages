It is similar to a trust. \n\n- The savings are collected by La Foncière: who agrees with TdL's values and goals can adquire shares of €103.59 - with tax deduction of 9%) it then buys agricultural land and buildings, which are rented out to farmers on long-term leases. \n\n- The purchase and installment process of farmers is assisted by local voluntary collaborators of TdL who cooperate with full time staffers of the regional TdL organizations.  \n\n- Sadly, it is not legal in France to convert \"shares\" into a  public utility [David, their translation was: \"to make a public issue of shares] without being registered with the Financial Markets Regulatory. -> a commons-unfriendly-policy"

They are diverse in size and in production: vegetables, dairy products, cereals and bread, fruits, pigs, poultry, sheep, beer, honey, etc. Almost all farms market their products locally through farm shops, local markets, shops or caterers or as part of community-supported agriculture schemes. Many also host a range of other social and economic activities: processing businesses, training and education, agro-tourism, etc.\nA presentation of all TDL farms is available on our website (in French)."
