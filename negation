This holds both for defined negations (“something is not”) and undefined negations (“everything that something is not”). In this sense, negation must be understood as a positive operator because it is only used in operations that really (i.e., positively) take place. All negations are used to gain positive operative connections because, to be able to negate, one must be able to distinguish what one wants to negate: one can only negate within a distinction [→[[Operation/Observation]]]. For this reason, no system is able to terminate itself through its own operations; in any case, negation of oneself is yet another confirmation of autopoiesis. Negation thus seems to be a point of departure for analyzing the construction of reality in meaning-constituting systems [→Constructivism]. [G.C.] –– [[Unlocking Luhmann]], p. 155–156"
