Iconic Logic uses visual representations, such as icons and diagrams, to express the concepts of logic, whereas traditional symbolic logic uses symbols. BL specifically focuses on the mathematical concept of [[Enclosure]] and its interpretation as the logical operation \"IMPLIES.\" The aim of learning BL is to develop a simpler way of thinking about logic and, as a result, simplify computational algorithms and architectures. The strategy for learning BL is to start with the simplest mathematical idea and make observations until a model of computation can be constructed. The result is the discovery that logic has a geometric nature that can be expressed through an algebra of enclosures."
