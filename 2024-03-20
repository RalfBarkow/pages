This division allows for easier analysis, manipulation, or processing of the graph data. Partitioning is often performed to simplify complex graphs and to enable more efficient algorithms or computations.\n\nHere are some common reasons for partitioning a graph:\n\n1. **Scalability**: Large graphs can be difficult to process efficiently. Partitioning allows for distributing the workload across multiple nodes or processors, improving scalability.\n\n2. **Parallelism**: Partitioning a graph can facilitate parallel processing by dividing the graph into smaller components that can be processed independently in parallel.\n\n3. **Data Organization**: Partitioning can help organize the data within a graph based on different attributes or properties, making it easier to navigate and analyze.\n\n4. **Graph Algorithms**: Some graph algorithms may require dividing the graph into smaller subgraphs to apply specific algorithms or optimizations efficiently.\n\n5. **Graph Visualization**: Partitioning can aid in graph visualization by breaking down a complex graph into smaller, more manageable components that are easier to visualize and interpret.\n\nOverall, partitioning a graph aims to simplify complex graph structures, improve efficiency in processing or analysis, and enable more effective utilization of graph data in various applications."

      "text": "Viewing hypertext links from a network perspective and applying graph partitioning techniques can provide valuable insights and benefits:\n\n1. **[[Community Detection]]**: Hypertext links often form communities or clusters of interconnected pages that share similar topics or themes. Graph partitioning algorithms can help identify these communities by partitioning the graph into cohesive subgraphs where nodes within the same partition are densely connected while having fewer connections to nodes in other partitions. This facilitates the discovery of clusters of related web pages or documents.\n\n2. **PageRank and Influence Analysis**: Graph partitioning can be used to analyze the influence and importance of web pages within the network. Partitioning the graph allows for the identification of central nodes or clusters that play significant roles in information dissemination and influence propagation. Techniques like PageRank can be applied within partitions to measure the importance of individual pages within their respective communities.\n\n3. **Network Optimization**: Partitioning the hypertext network can lead to more efficient network structures for tasks such as content delivery, search indexing, and web crawling. By dividing the network into smaller, more manageable partitions, network resources can be allocated more effectively, reducing the complexity of operations and improving scalability and performance.\n\n4. **Anomaly Detection and Security**: Graph partitioning can help detect anomalies or suspicious behavior within the hypertext network. By identifying partitions that deviate from expected patterns of connectivity or content similarity, anomalies such as spam or malicious websites can be detected more effectively. Partitioning can also aid in isolating and containing security threats within specific segments of the network.\n\n5. **Content Recommendation and Personalization**: Understanding the structure of the hypertext network through graph partitioning can enhance content recommendation systems and personalized user experiences. By partitioning the graph based on user interests, preferences, or browsing history, relevant content can be recommended within each partition, leading to improved user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nIn summary, applying graph partitioning techniques to hypertext networks allows for the discovery of community structures, analysis of influence and importance, optimization of network operations, detection of anomalies, and enhancement of content recommendation systems, ultimately leading to more effective management and utilization of the hypertext data.

In today's theories of social systems, references to time are made quite frequently, as is evident, for example, in the \"thorough temporalization of elementary concepts\" (Luhmann 1984:28=1993/95:16). (1) However, it is not clear why this reference to time is so often necessary. It is generally accepted that social system theory is heavily influenced by phenomenology. In the same way that phenomenology regarded the problem domain of time as the most fundamental,(2) the problem of time may also fundamentally support the entire system theory. For the record, such speculations are not merely groundless to open a debate, nor are they intended to justify the system theory by borrowing the authority of an establi-cation called phenomenology, which has a wide following. In fact, today's social system theory has a more fundamental internal relationship to phenomenology than merely an influence relationship. For some reason, the following points are often overlooked. In other words, communication, which is an element of the social system, can only be about something at all times. This corresponds to the structure of directionality that makes phenomenology possible. In other words, something communicated is always an internal manifestation of the social system, or in other words, a social phenomenon, as opposed to an awareness phenomenon. The reason why social systems theory must address the issue of system time is that this social phenomenon is related to the current state of the system at any given time."

However, it is not easy, but rather rather difficult, to discuss time in social systems, given the current level of sociological theory. First of all, the existence of the social system itself may be questioned to a greater or lesser degree. In this respect, in the genealogy of the philosophy of consciousness, the certainty of the thinking self was the starting point, so it was not so difficult to discuss the time of consciousness as a consequence of the development from this point. In contrast, however, in the case of social systems, the very existence of the system itself is in doubt for theories of action that do not recognize irreducible emergent properties and for a kind of utilitarianism that regards the system concept as a mere model for analysis, and unless this part is confirmed, there is little room to discuss systemic time. Therefore, we cannot discuss system time unless we are sure of this part."

As an aside, without any further argument, let me suggest that the question of the existence of a social system is almost synonymous with the question of system time. In other words, it would not be right to say that the social system exists first as a kind of pure ego, and then we can finally discuss system time in analogy with the experiential flow. If we assume the order to be all the way through, it seems more plausible that the opposite is true, i.e., that we can discuss system time and then thematize the reality of the system. This is because the autonomy of a system can be described as \"temporal autonomy\" (Bergmann 1981:110). A system processes external events according to its internal temporal order, and therefore must always understand its boundary as a \"temporal boundary\" (Bergmann 1981:109). System-specific time is what guarantees (or even enforces) the system's differentiation from its environment and its autonomy (3)."

It would require more space. Therefore, keeping these issues in mind, we will only ask how the \"as it is now (Jetzt und So)\" aspect of system time can exist in the first place as an issue for the time being(4). As is well known, the challenge of modern social system theory is to observe how and why the system is being observed. This differs from a theory that attempts an objectivistic mercantilist viewpoint, such as that of a patient with a theoretical disease, in that it sets the problem in the first place. The difference between the two may be characterized as a shift from existence theory to recognition theory in system theory. Social system theory views various social systems not as mono, which is an internal relationship between the whole and its parts, but as one of the world's subjects with its own external environment.5 As an illustration of this, the theory of social systems is a theory that considers the social system as an entity with its own external environment, and as such, it is a theory of social systems. (5) As an illustration, social system theory is a second-order observer that observes the observer called the social system. And this is precisely the reason for setting the subject of this paper as mentioned above. In other words, the \"as-is\" aspect of system time is the starting point for observation of the system as it exists at any given time, and is always a blind spot or, in the manner of phenomenology, always anonymous to the system itself. Therefore, the observation of how such and such an aspect could be as it is now is considered to be a central issue for the social system theory of the second-order observer."

Although the attempts at a phenomenological sociology represented by Alfred Schutz have made a great contribution to sociology from a epistemological perspective, the chosen grounding system has always been consciousness-oriented, and in that sense it is only sociology made into phenomenology. Therefore, later developments of phenomenological sociology continue to strive to sociologize phenomenological sociology through concepts such as reciprocal action, language, and the living world. However, the connection between phenomenology and pragmatic theory is not as inevitable as one might think. This is because it was the orientation structure of consciousness, rather than the subject itself, that made phenomenology possible. Therefore, if we realize that the structure of related orientations can also be found between social systems and social phenomena, we can finally sociologize phenomenology. Again, as with consciousness, communication is always about something. This is sociological phenomenology. This proposal, however, is not merely a shift of the theoretical basis from the subject of consciousness to the social system. It would also entail a fundamental shift in the original point of departure of phenomenological sociology."

Schutz wrote in his major work: \"By a rough analysis, the problem of meaning is the problem of time. Schutz stated in his main work: \"A rough analysis has already shown that the problem of meaning is a problem of time. This question of time is not a question of physical space-time, which can be divided or measured, nor is it a question of historical time, which is limited to a passage filled with external events, but it is a question of \"internal time consciousness,\" of each individual's unique sense of continuity. For the experiencer, the meaning of his or her various experiences is constituted thereby\" (Schutz 1932:9-10=1982:24). This problematization was possible because phenomenological sociology could assume that the subject's internal time is always present prior to meaning, and thus unquestionable. The distinction between subjective and objective time is not as clear as it could be. The specificity of subjective time, which should be separated from objective time, is left unexplored, except for the use of such terms as continuity and experience. In fact, the image of inner time that emerges from this consideration is not so different from that of linearized, spatialized objective time. This is because rational action, one of the main themes of phenomenological sociology, can only be scaled in terms of spatialized and objective time, and there is no way to set up the purpose and means of rational action(6)."

      "text": "According to phenomenological sociology, social science contains issues that have different meanings from those of the natural sciences. To thematize these issues, it was thought necessary to support the analysis of internal temporal consciousness of phenomenology. In reality, however, phenomenological sociology seems to have overturned rather than assisted the phenomenological view, as later summarized by the term \"epoché of natural attitudes. Originally, in Husserl's phenomenology, a natural attitude was an attitude that made naturalized and spatialized notions of time self-evident, and this attitude had to be returned in order to approach an inner sense of time.7 However, in contrast to this, Husserl's phenomenology is not a natural attitude, but an attitude that is not naturalized, but an attitude that is not naturalized, but an attitude that is not naturalized, but an attitude that is not naturalized, and this attitude has to be returned in order to approach an inner sense of time. In contrast, phenomenological sociology considered that the natural attitude is an immersion in continuity, and that this naivete must be returned for rational action, and that an intermediate goal must be established in a reflective way. This view may lead to the following conclusion. The meaning of an act, in other words, is distinguished by the spatialization of subjective time. Internal time must be spatialized as divisible through reflection. Only then can the meaning of experience be made salient, and the meaning of action, i.e., the rational relation between purpose and means, be made possible. Therefore, according to phenomenological sociology, the unit of action is a function of the \"span\" of the projection (Schutz 1932:62=1982:83)(8)."

This was not surprising, since time was considered more fundamental than meaning in the question's formulation. At any rate, phenomenological sociology avoided from the outset the complexities of internal time, as Husserl did. One must be careful not to naively celebrate such avoidance as a wise move within the realm of empirical science. Instead, phenomenological sociology had to consider the following factors If the subject matter of sociology is not merely a natural phenomenon, but something with meaning, then time can also be treated experientially as a meaningful phenomenon. In phenomenological sociology, time is not merely a category of cognition of the external observer, but is already considered as another synthetic dimension within the object of observation itself. However, to be more thorough, the fact that time was already present in the object itself had to be considered in the following way. In other words, the selection of what is significant among various aspects of time, self-reflection on such selection, etc., as well as the temporal aspects necessary for such selection and self-reflection, are themselves constructed by the object itself, using its meaning (9)."

With the shift from phenomenological sociology to sociological phenomenology, the starting point must also be changed in this way. Phenomenological sociology's initial assumption of subjective time forces us to ask the difficult question of how objectivity can be achieved by first discussing the whole/part of the subject's interior, and then reaching the exterior. In contrast, sociological phenomenology does not presuppose systemic time in social systems. As mentioned earlier, communication can only be something of a communication, which means not only that the environment cannot exist without a relationship with the social system, but also that the social system cannot exist without a relationship with the environment. This can be expressed as follows. In other words, a system is a system and its environment."

However, such naivete is no longer permissible if we are more thorough in our discovery of orientation. To aspire means to differentiate, to draw a distinction (Lu㎞ann1996a:31). Therefore, we cannot assume internal time and from there consider synchronicity with the outside world. On the contrary, time must be meaningfully constituted only in relation to its synchronicity with the environment. If a system can only be in relation to its environment, it cannot be assumed to be identical to it in an ontological sense. Identity is also a phenomenon that becomes possible only through meaning within the system/environment distinction, and is open to a wide variety of possibilities for definition. Therefore, meaning precedes all subjects. Meaning must be a basic concept, not merely something conceived by a subject (Luhmann 1971=, 1987). It is a subjectless concept of meaning. If the social world is to be meaningfully constituted, meaning should have been the basic concept from the very beginning, rather than a problem to be thematized. Perhaps this is the first time that social science can be clearly distinguished from the natural sciences. Socioscience is concerned with all systems that operate using meaning, i.e., both the cognitive system and the social system. In this view, sociology cannot be satisfied with considering only that which is subjective in terms of time. Empirical sociology and anthropology have long pointed out that there is a unique social time that exists in each society between subjective and objective time (10). (10) Theorizing about social time becomes possible only when we consider the question of time as a question of meaning."

This relation itself is not yet time, but by not presupposing time, the existential-metaphysical question of what time is in the first place, which goes back to its source, is avoided. The question of time is rather framed as a constructionist one. That is, how is time achieved through a synchronous relationship between system and environment (Luhmann-1990b; Luhmann1996b:309)? However, it is not possible to go into the whole picture of how time is constructed from the simultaneity of the system and the environment in the following sections. As we have already mentioned, we will limit our discussion to the relationship with the second-order observer's observation of the social system, the observer, and ask the following questions. In other words, how can the aspect of \"as it is now\" in system time be as it is now? Observing how and why a system observes something is not the only way to observe its current state as selectively manifested by the system. The \"as-is\" aspect of system time is always a blind spot for the system, since it is the starting point for all observations by the system. Therefore, the second-order observation. Therefore, the second-order observation is to observe how the system can be as it is now. In the first place, the very phrase \"as it is now\" suggests that it is only a choice based on the assumption of other possibilities, which could be either this way or that way. This alone does not leave unanswered the question of how this could be so now. In fact, the core of system formation is not merely the fact that elements occur and processes (whether we call them sustainable or not) are formed, but that they are a choice among various possibilities (Luhmann 1975:22=1986:8). In other words, rather than the system presupposing the elements of the system, the elements of the system must be considered to presuppose the system. It is only through a network of possible relationships within the system that elements selectively acquire the qualities that make them elements of the system (Luhmann1984:41-44=1993/95:31-35), and only now are they manifested as such."

This is not as obvious as it may seem. It can be said that today's social system theory, which holds that the past and the future are only the level of the present, is rather commonly interpreted as a kind of present-centered theory, as is the case with phenomenology.11 However, the present is not the only level of the past and the future, but it is also the only level of the present. (11) However, when we realize that the factors that emerge in the present are selections among various possibilities based on the system, we are forced to change our understanding of social system theory as being present-centered."

This is that not only the creation of elements, but also their disappearance, is based on the system. At first glance, this may appear to be directly contained in the so-called autopoiesis concept of continuous reproduction of elements by the system itself. But to be precise, \"the formal definition of orthopoiesis gives no indication of the span of time in which elements exist\" (Luhma, 1990:8=1996:19). At the biological level, which is the origin of this concept, we can assume with no particular difficulty that mortal decay is inevitable in any organism, and that the consequent constant alternation of cells and intracellular molecules may be considered as a matter of course in itself. But it is not a social system. However, it is not necessarily true that a social system will inevitably decline toward death, as is the case with organisms. Rather, social systems must create their own decline (Luhmann 1990:9=1996:20). Therefore, we cannot assume that elements appear and disappear on their own as a result of continuous i-production. Without the system's enforcement of disappearance, the elements would remain as they are. Although today's social system theory refers to elements as \"events\" that disappear as soon as they appear, this is not such a simple assertion for the reasons I have already mentioned. The eventuality and instantaneousness of an element must be given a theory other than the formal definition of autopoiesis."

It only forms the facticity of the process that takes place over time, but does not express the selectivity of the elements. In fact, unlike what is usually assumed, process and its analogous metaphors such as flow and continuity are actually undifferentiated from the spatial and phenomenal dimensions that underlie motion representations, and have not yet reached a single independent dimension called time (Luhmann 1990b: 97, 98). Luhmann1990b: 97, 98). Therefore, it does not explain the temporality of elements as events, such as appearances and disappearances. At this point, we would like to recall our earlier observation that the question of time is a question of meaning."

Therefore, the system is always forced to make choices according to its meaning, and it must constantly renew the differences between manifestations and possibilities. This fundamental instability of meaning in the social system is linked to the problem of complexity. This is because meaning reflects exorbitant complexity as a constant constraint on choice (Luhmann1984:92-98=1993/95:92-98). How, then, does the system increase the complexity that cannot be completely controlled, that is, that cannot be completely transparent, in order to achieve a higher degree of progression despite the fact that it has been domesticated, so to speak, as inherent complexity? In this case, the following must be considered. In other words, what is indicated by the increase in system-specific complexity is not merely a quantitative expansion of inter-elemental relationships. Increased system complexity refers to the quantitative expansion of inter-elemental relationships as well as to the increased selectivity of the system structure in response to these relationships (Luhmann 1975:207, 208= 1986:225-226). In other words, as the amount of choices increases, the problem of selection emerges, and therefore the feasibility must be limited structurally at all times. Only when complexity is qualitatively defined and ordered by structure can it be called system complexity and its increase be discussed. System complexity exists only as structured complexity."

      "text": "What is more important as a clue to approaching the problem of system time is not the process before or after, but rather this structure. For only when the quantity, or complexity, of realizable relationships among elements expands, and with it the ability to select structures that define elemental qualities, can the system be freed from the need to react to the environment in a synchronous - versus - versus - reaction, and thus be free to take on a fixed temporality separate from the outside world. The system is free from the need to respond to the environment in a synchronous - versus - - response, and can acquire a unique temporality separate from the outside world. In this respect, the issue of fixed time in a system is first and foremost a complex one. It is this fixed time that gives the elements temporality as an event and allows the system to self-reproduce by constantly generating and deleting elements. In particular, since systems today are considered to be systems that self-reproduce autonomously despite their isolation from the environment and their closed nature, the entirety of their fixed time has a definitive meaning for the eventuality of the elements. The structure of a system is the structure of expectations (Luhmann 1984:139=1993/95:147), and a self-regulating, closed system is not only capable of self-reproduction, but also of creating a structure of expectations for its own sake, rather than externally, but also of creating a new structure of expectations that would violate its own expectations. In order to produce newness that will contradict our expectations, and to provide room for other factors to develop, we must absorb the newness thus generated into the oldness again. To this end, the system makes the entirety of the possibilities of manifesting elements its own invisible horizon in the temporal form of past/future. The system temporalizes its own complexity in terms of the past/future distinction. The system temporalizes its own complexity in terms of past/future, because only then can elements be destabilized. The duality of the horizon is multiplied when we consider the present of the future or the present of the past. Both have their own future and past. The temporalstructure of time is itself the \"future of the future present .... ... This reflexivity alone makes possible the abandonment of something like a stable and lasting presence\" (Luhmann 1990:11=1996:23)a"

      "text": "Elements are not unstable in themselves. It becomes unstable and eventful in the uncertainty of the double horizon of past and future, and the temporal phase of the present can take on its unique status as a boundary between past and future. The uniqueness of being a boundary is that it belongs to both sides of the distinction, but at the same time it does not belong to either side. The present as a boundary, in other words, is a mixture of the old of the past and the new of the future, yet it is different from both of them. Only in this phase would the creation and disappearance of elements be possible. It is an ambivalent place where events can appear and lose their novelty at the same time. By including the past and the future, the system can produce newness that contradicts the structure of its own expectations in the present, and then absorb that newness into the old again. Therefore, the continuous self-reproduction of the current system is not possible without either the past or the future. [[Verzeitlichung]] refers here to the production of the difference between the past and the future. If only the past exists for the system, i.e., if the present of the manifest action is merely a repetition of the past, the system will not reproduce itself (wieesist) only as it is now. On the other hand, if only the future exists, the system will understand itself as a constant deviation from its own fixed state, for example, as a goal, and will fall into the deviation of deviation upon deviation. A system gains self-organization that allows it to continue to learn only if it is oriented toward the difference between the past and the future and, in this sense, produces time\" (Luhmann 1997:60-61). The elements of a system first acquire their eventuality in the whole of system time, which includes both past and future, and are then temporalized (13). This in turn triggers the various possibilities that may emerge in the system and further increases its complexity. Time is an \"extension of choice\" (Luhmann 1980:239)."

For the first time in the temporalization of the distinction between the past and the future, the present as such can exist as an unstable and selective thing that can arise or perish. However, this does not deny that self-reproduction of the system can only take place in the present, nor does it imply any kind of determinism. Even if the past and the future define the present, they do so on a level playing field, not as a linear process of causality. However, the concept of time in social system theory cannot be understood only as present-centered. Not only are the past and the future the horizons of the present, but the present also becomes unstable for the first time in the whole of this time, appearing and disappearing as it does now, as a concrete, so to speak, living thing with a limited life span (14). (14) The theoretical ideal of self-reproduction in an autonomous, closed system can be more accurately generalized to social systems by taking this into consideration. As briefly mentioned earlier, the formal definition of so-called autopoiesis itself does not say anything about the time width of elements. Only after the social system is given a theory of system time that further includes past and future, are its elements thoroughly temporalized, becoming events that arise and perish, setting in motion the system's ceaseless self-reproduction."

      "text": "Although social systems theory has not clarified this, self-reproduction of a system is inseparable from the issue of system time. This seems to be almost the same as the situation discussed above, where elements of a system can be created and destroyed only in the context of the entire system time, including the past and the future (15). (15) Moreover, the current events produced in the entire system time make possible the past and the future, which are the horizon of the current events, and this continues as the self-reproduction of the system. Thus, system self-reproduction means self-reproduction of system time as it is. In other words, if the system is self-reliant, then time is also self-reliant, in the sense that there is an autonomous and closed cyclic relationship between the present and the past and the future, and the past and the future produce the present. If this is the case, we cannot assume primacy for any of the temporal phases of past, present, and future, including the concept of time that is naively present-centric. From the theoretical standpoint that systems self-reproduce in an autonomous and closed fashion, these temporal phases must also be mutually regulated, more like a network than a hierarchy. In this view, then, there cannot be any fundamental, isochronous non-temporality that precedes the composition of systemic time (16). (16) What constitutes time is not some non-temporal source, but time itself. The stability and sameness of a system are also dynamic only insofar as time continually produces itself, and only after a certain period of identical non-temporality. Its stability is based on instability\" (Luhmann 1990:10=1996:21)."

Therefore, we should not think of synchronicity as a mutually subjective, mutually shared single moment in time, based on the initial assumption of the time of each subject as itself. Rather, \"synchronicity is the fundamental fact that precedes all temporality\" (Luhmann 1990b:98). Only through difference from a synchronous environment does each system acquire its own specific temporality, or rather, its own specificity within each system time, and not the other way around. Therefore, the question of system time is different from the philosophical conception of consciousness, and is not limited to the mere question of the \"internal\" time of the system in terms of the mutually regulating relationship between the whole and its parts within system time. The mutually regular relationships of past, present, and future discussed above can be self-contained as a temporality unique to the system only when they differ from those of the outside (environment). In other words, because the system \"ages with\" its environment, it preserves its own past and future through the difference between them, and also lives in its own unique way in the present."

Graph partitioning algorithms can help identify these communities by partitioning the graph into cohesive subgraphs where nodes within the same partition are densely connected while having fewer connections to nodes in other partitions. This facilitates the discovery of clusters of related web pages or documents.\n\n2. **PageRank and Influence Analysis**: Graph partitioning can be used to analyze the influence and importance of web pages within the network. Partitioning the graph allows for the identification of central nodes or clusters that play significant roles in information dissemination and influence propagation. Techniques like PageRank can be applied within partitions to measure the importance of individual pages within their respective communities.\n\n3. **Network Optimization**: Partitioning the hypertext network can lead to more efficient network structures for tasks such as content delivery, search indexing, and web crawling. By dividing the network into smaller, more manageable partitions, network resources can be allocated more effectively, reducing the complexity of operations and improving scalability and performance.\n\n4. **Anomaly Detection and Security**: Graph partitioning can help detect anomalies or suspicious behavior within the hypertext network. By identifying partitions that deviate from expected patterns of connectivity or content similarity, anomalies such as spam or malicious websites can be detected more effectively. Partitioning can also aid in isolating and containing security threats within specific segments of the network.\n\n5. **Content Recommendation and Personalization**: Understanding the structure of the hypertext network through graph partitioning can enhance content recommendation systems and personalized user experiences. By partitioning the graph based on user interests, preferences, or browsing history, relevant content can be recommended within each partition, leading to improved user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nIn summary, applying graph partitioning techniques to hypertext networks allows for the discovery of community structures, analysis of influence and importance, optimization of network operations, detection of anomalies, and enhancement of content recommendation systems, ultimately leading to more effective management and utilization of the hypertext data.

The initial promises of cybernetics and more recently of artificial intelligence have proved harder than expected to attain. Some problems in pattern recognition and robotics simply appear to be difficult in spite of the fact that humans solve such problems every day. Such problems seem to exhibit an intrinsic complexity, a complexity that the process of finding their solutions must share."

The theory of social systems as a second order observer observes the phase `Nowand So' in system time of a first order observer because it is always a blind spot for the first order observer. For this purpose, (1) I will formulate the theory of social systems by Niklas Luhmann as \"Sociological Phenomenology\": Parallel to consciousnesses, social systems are observed not as things but as subjects in the world. However, (2) contrary to phenomenological sociology, I start not from `the problem of meaning is a problem of time' but from `the problem of time is a problem of meaning'. This means that system time is a meaningful construction. Finally, (3) I show that the phase `Now and So' can be now and so through the distinction of past/future. In whole system time, an event as an element of the system can appear and disappear in the present."

Although the attempts at a phenomenological sociology represented by Alfred Schutz have made a great contribution to sociology from a epistemological perspective, the chosen grounding system has always been consciousness-oriented, and in that sense it is only sociology made into phenomenology. Therefore, later developments of phenomenological sociology continue to strive to sociologize phenomenological sociology through concepts such as reciprocal action, language, and the living world. However, the connection between phenomenology and pragmatic theory is not as inevitable as one might think. This is because it was the orientation structure of consciousness, rather than the subject itself, that made phenomenology possible. Therefore, if we realize that the structure of related orientations can also be found between social systems and social phenomena, we can finally sociologize phenomenology. Again, as with consciousness, communication is always about something. This is sociological phenomenology. This proposal, however, is not merely a shift of the theoretical basis from the subject of consciousness to the social system. It would also entail a fundamental shift in the original point of departure of phenomenological sociology."

Schutz wrote in his major work: \"By a rough analysis, the problem of meaning is the problem of time. Schutz stated in his main work: \"A rough analysis has already shown that the problem of meaning is a problem of time. This question of time is not a question of physical space-time, which can be divided or measured, nor is it a question of historical time, which is limited to a passage filled with external events, but it is a question of \"internal time consciousness,\" of each individual's unique sense of continuity. For the experiencer, the meaning of his or her various experiences is constituted thereby\" (Schutz 1932:9-10=1982:24). This problematization was possible because phenomenological sociology could assume that the subject's internal time is always present prior to meaning, and thus unquestionable. The distinction between subjective and objective time is not as clear as it could be. The specificity of subjective time, which should be separated from objective time, is left unexplored, except for the use of such terms as continuity and experience. In fact, the image of inner time that emerges from this consideration is not so different from that of linearized, spatialized objective time. This is because rational action, one of the main themes of phenomenological sociology, can only be scaled in terms of spatialized and objective time, and there is no way to set up the purpose and means of rational action(6)."

One must be careful not to naively celebrate such avoidance as a wise move within the realm of empirical science. Instead, phenomenological sociology had to consider the following factors If the subject matter of sociology is not merely a natural phenomenon, but something with meaning, then time can also be treated experientially as a meaningful phenomenon. In phenomenological sociology, time is not merely a category of cognition of the external observer, but is already considered as another synthetic dimension within the object of observation itself. However, to be more thorough, the fact that time was already present in the object itself had to be considered in the following way. In other words, the selection of what is significant among various aspects of time, self-reflection on such selection, etc., as well as the temporal aspects necessary for such selection and self-reflection, are themselves constructed by the object itself, using its meaning (9)."

With the shift from phenomenological sociology to sociological phenomenology, the starting point must also be changed in this way. Phenomenological sociology's initial assumption of subjective time forces us to ask the difficult question of how objectivity can be achieved by first discussing the whole/part of the subject's interior, and then reaching the exterior. In contrast, sociological phenomenology does not presuppose systemic time in social systems. As mentioned earlier, communication can only be something of a communication, which means not only that the environment cannot exist without a relationship with the social system, but also that the social system cannot exist without a relationship with the environment. This can be expressed as follows. In other words, a system is a system and its environment."

However, such naivete is no longer permissible if we are more thorough in our discovery of orientation. To aspire means to differentiate, to draw a distinction (Lu㎞ann1996a:31). Therefore, we cannot assume internal time and from there consider synchronicity with the outside world. On the contrary, time must be meaningfully constituted only in relation to its synchronicity with the environment. If a system can only be in relation to its environment, it cannot be assumed to be identical to it in an ontological sense. Identity is also a phenomenon that becomes possible only through meaning within the system/environment distinction, and is open to a wide variety of possibilities for definition. Therefore, meaning precedes all subjects. Meaning must be a basic concept, not merely something conceived by a subject (Luhmann 1971=, 1987). It is a subjectless concept of meaning. If the social world is to be meaningfully constituted, meaning should have been the basic concept from the very beginning, rather than a problem to be thematized. Perhaps this is the first time that social science can be clearly distinguished from the natural sciences. Socioscience is concerned with all systems that operate using meaning, i.e., both the cognitive system and the social system. In this view, sociology cannot be satisfied with considering only that which is subjective in terms of time. Empirical sociology and anthropology have long pointed out that there is a unique social time that exists in each society between subjective and objective time (10). (10) Theorizing about social time becomes possible only when we consider the question of time as a question of meaning."

This relation itself is not yet time, but by not presupposing time, the existential-metaphysical question of what time is in the first place, which goes back to its source, is avoided. The question of time is rather framed as a constructionist one. That is, how is time achieved through a synchronous relationship between system and environment (Luhmann-1990b; Luhmann1996b:309)? However, it is not possible to go into the whole picture of how time is constructed from the simultaneity of the system and the environment in the following sections. As we have already mentioned, we will limit our discussion to the relationship with the second-order observer's observation of the social system, the observer, and ask the following questions. In other words, how can the aspect of \"as it is now\" in system time be as it is now? Observing how and why a system observes something is not the only way to observe its current state as selectively manifested by the system. The \"as-is\" aspect of system time is always a blind spot for the system, since it is the starting point for all observations by the system. Therefore, the second-order observation. Therefore, the second-order observation is to observe how the system can be as it is now. In the first place, the very phrase \"as it is now\" suggests that it is only a choice based on the assumption of other possibilities, which could be either this way or that way. This alone does not leave unanswered the question of how this could be so now. In fact, the core of system formation is not merely the fact that elements occur and processes (whether we call them sustainable or not) are formed, but that they are a choice among various possibilities (Luhmann 1975:22=1986:8). In other words, rather than the system presupposing the elements of the system, the elements of the system must be considered to presuppose the system. It is only through a network of possible relationships within the system that elements selectively acquire the qualities that make them elements of the system (Luhmann1984:41-44=1993/95:31-35), and only now are they manifested as such."

This is not as obvious as it may seem. It can be said that today's social system theory, which holds that the past and the future are only the level of the present, is rather commonly interpreted as a kind of present-centered theory, as is the case with phenomenology.11 However, the present is not the only level of the past and the future, but it is also the only level of the present. (11) However, when we realize that the factors that emerge in the present are selections among various possibilities based on the system, we are forced to change our understanding of social system theory as being present-centered."

This is that not only the creation of elements, but also their disappearance, is based on the system. At first glance, this may appear to be directly contained in the so-called autopoiesis concept of continuous reproduction of elements by the system itself. But to be precise, \"the formal definition of orthopoiesis gives no indication of the span of time in which elements exist\" (Luhma, 1990:8=1996:19). At the biological level, which is the origin of this concept, we can assume with no particular difficulty that mortal decay is inevitable in any organism, and that the consequent constant alternation of cells and intracellular molecules may be considered as a matter of course in itself. But it is not a social system. However, it is not necessarily true that a social system will inevitably decline toward death, as is the case with organisms. Rather, social systems must create their own decline (Luhmann 1990:9=1996:20). Therefore, we cannot assume that elements appear and disappear on their own as a result of continuous i-production. Without the system's enforcement of disappearance, the elements would remain as they are. Although today's social system theory refers to elements as \"events\" that disappear as soon as they appear, this is not such a simple assertion for the reasons I have already mentioned. The eventuality and instantaneousness of an element must be given a theory other than the formal definition of autopoiesis."

Events are the happening that forms the difference between the \"before\" and the \"after\" (Luhmann 1990:10=1996:22). This identification, however, fixes a particular element in place, but it does not create or eliminate the element. It only forms the facticity of the process that takes place over time, but does not express the selectivity of the elements. In fact, unlike what is usually assumed, process and its analogous metaphors such as flow and continuity are actually undifferentiated from the spatial and phenomenal dimensions that underlie motion representations, and have not yet reached a single independent dimension called time (Luhmann 1990b: 97, 98). Luhmann1990b: 97, 98). Therefore, it does not explain the temporality of elements as events, such as appearances and disappearances.

Therefore, the system is always forced to make choices according to its meaning, and it must constantly renew the differences between manifestations and possibilities. This fundamental instability of meaning in the social system is linked to the problem of complexity. This is because meaning reflects exorbitant complexity as a constant constraint on choice (Luhmann1984:92-98=1993/95:92-98). How, then, does the system increase the complexity that cannot be completely controlled, that is, that cannot be completely transparent, in order to achieve a higher degree of progression despite the fact that it has been domesticated, so to speak, as inherent complexity? In this case, the following must be considered. In other words, what is indicated by the increase in system-specific complexity is not merely a quantitative expansion of inter-elemental relationships. Increased system complexity refers to the quantitative expansion of inter-elemental relationships as well as to the increased selectivity of the system structure in response to these relationships (Luhmann 1975:207, 208= 1986:225-226). In other words, as the amount of choices increases, the problem of selection emerges, and therefore the feasibility must be limited structurally at all times. Only when complexity is qualitatively defined and ordered by structure can it be called system complexity and its increase be discussed. System complexity exists only as structured complexity."

For only when the quantity, or complexity, of realizable relationships among elements expands, and with it the ability to select structures that define elemental qualities, can the system be freed from the need to react to the environment in a synchronous - versus - versus - reaction, and thus be free to take on a fixed temporality separate from the outside world. The system is free from the need to respond to the environment in a synchronous - versus - - response, and can acquire a unique temporality separate from the outside world. In this respect, the issue of fixed time in a system is first and foremost a complex one. It is this fixed time that gives the elements temporality as an event and allows the system to self-reproduce by constantly generating and deleting elements. In particular, since systems today are considered to be systems that self-reproduce autonomously despite their isolation from the environment and their closed nature, the entirety of their fixed time has a definitive meaning for the eventuality of the elements. The structure of a system is the structure of expectations (Luhmann 1984:139=1993/95:147), and a self-regulating, closed system is not only capable of self-reproduction, but also of creating a structure of expectations for its own sake, rather than externally, but also of creating a new structure of expectations that would violate its own expectations. In order to produce newness that will contradict our expectations, and to provide room for other factors to develop, we must absorb the newness thus generated into the oldness again. To this end, the system makes the entirety of the possibilities of manifesting elements its own invisible horizon in the temporal form of past/future. The system temporalizes its own complexity in terms of the past/future distinction. The system temporalizes its own complexity in terms of past/future, because only then can elements be destabilized. The duality of the horizon is multiplied when we consider the present of the future or the present of the past. Both have their own future and past. The temporalstructure of time is itself the \"future of the future present .... ... This reflexivity alone makes possible the abandonment of something like a stable and lasting presence\" (Luhmann 1990:11=1996:23)a"

However, this does not deny that self-reproduction of the system can only take place in the present, nor does it imply any kind of determinism. Even if the past and the future define the present, they do so on a level playing field, not as a linear process of causality. However, the concept of time in social system theory cannot be understood only as present-centered. Not only are the past and the future the horizons of the present, but the present also becomes unstable for the first time in the whole of this time, appearing and disappearing as it does now, as a concrete, so to speak, living thing with a limited life span (14). (14) The theoretical ideal of self-reproduction in an autonomous, closed system can be more accurately generalized to social systems by taking this into consideration. As briefly mentioned earlier, the formal definition of so-called autopoiesis itself does not say anything about the time width of elements. Only after the social system is given a theory of system time that further includes past and future, are its elements thoroughly temporalized, becoming events that arise and perish, setting in motion the system's ceaseless self-reproduction."

This seems to be almost the same as the situation discussed above, where elements of a system can be created and destroyed only in the context of the entire system time, including the past and the future (15). (15) Moreover, the current events produced in the entire system time make possible the past and the future, which are the horizon of the current events, and this continues as the self-reproduction of the system. Thus, system self-reproduction means self-reproduction of system time as it is. In other words, if the system is self-reliant, then time is also self-reliant, in the sense that there is an autonomous and closed cyclic relationship between the present and the past and the future, and the past and the future produce the present. If this is the case, we cannot assume primacy for any of the temporal phases of past, present, and future, including the concept of time that is naively present-centric. From the theoretical standpoint that systems self-reproduce in an autonomous and closed fashion, these temporal phases must also be mutually regulated, more like a network than a hierarchy. In this view, then, there cannot be any fundamental, isochronous non-temporality that precedes the composition of systemic time (16). (16) What constitutes time is not some non-temporal source, but time itself. The stability and sameness of a system are also dynamic only insofar as time continually produces itself, and only after a certain period of identical non-temporality. Its stability is based on instability\" (Luhmann 1990:10=1996:21)."

Rather, \"synchronicity is the fundamental fact that precedes all temporality\" (Luhmann 1990b:98). Only through difference from a synchronous environment does each system acquire its own specific temporality, or rather, its own specificity within each system time, and not the other way around. Therefore, the question of system time is different from the philosophical conception of consciousness, and is not limited to the mere question of the \"internal\" time of the system in terms of the mutually regulating relationship between the whole and its parts within system time. The mutually regular relationships of past, present, and future discussed above can be self-contained as a temporality unique to the system only when they differ from those of the outside (environment). In other words, because the system \"ages with\" its environment, it preserves its own past and future through the difference between them, and also lives in its own unique way in the present."
