Logistic models provide support for a large range of applications, such as analysing bottlenecks, improving customer service, configuring new logistic chains and adapting existing chains to new products and markets. Modelling the logistic chain is the main topic dealt with in this article. Recent developments in market demands, technology and structuring and redesign of logistic processes are also described. It is concluded that Operations Research models and techniques are well suited to analyse the local performance of logistic sub-chains and processes. But, in order to fully support the analysis of the performance of an integrated logistic chain the traditional Operations Research approach, in which the OR model is the starting point of the analysis and in which the data structure is derived from the model, is insufficient. In integrated logistic chain modelling the choice of suitable OR models should be determined by the information structure required and by the information technology available. To improve the performance of the total logistic chain an experimental environment is needed, including a set of OR models and having the capability to easily and quickly build these logistic models. We call this environment a logistic laboratory. To illustrate this concept two logistic laboratories, developed in cooperation with the authors, are described.\n"
