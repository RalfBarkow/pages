SVG support is quite complete, so you can also try other SVG files as well. Note that drawing complex SVG without the VectorEngine VM Plugin will slow down Cuis significantly. The Virtual Machine Plugin to enable fast drawing of vector graphics is integrated in the OpenSmalltalk Virtual Machine GitHub repository, but not yet in the official builds. In the meantime, you might run one of the VMs built by members of our community, that include the plugin: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rhkt4ayq24t2xbf/AACDb3mrjMUDB8Mptd-Bi6Zsa?dl=0\n\nIf you run Cuis with one of these VMs, and have selected a TrueType font as the system default, you'll see that the Morphic Halos include two new handles: \"Change Scale\" (center right) and \"Rotate\" (bottom left). Try them on any Morph!\n\n## History of development\n\nVector Graphics is actually what got the Cuis project started. In 2003, ten years before the Retina display, I (Juan Vuletich) decided that making Morphic zoomeable and independent of pixel resolution would require completely abandoning back compatibility with the existing Morphic in Squeak. I took Squeak 3.7 and started working on what would later be named Cuis Smalltalk.\n\nYou can see more about the early development of the projects at: [The Morphic 3 Project](http://www.jvuletich.org/Morphic3/Morphic3-200911.html), [Morphic 3 in action](http://www.jvuletich.org/Morphic3/Morphic3-201006.html), [First public presentation of the project (video)](http://www.jvuletich.org/Morphic3/Smalltalks2007/Smalltalks2007.html) and [A short history of Cuis](CuisHistory.md).\n\nA more recent landmark was in 2013, when a defensive disclosure on the techniques used in the project was published: [Prefiltering Antialiasing for General Vector Graphics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267152327_Prefiltering_Antialiasing_for_General_Vector_Graphics), [(also here)](https://priorart.ip.com/IPCOM/000232657). This meant the code could now be open-sourced without worries of someone else trying to get a patent on it.\n\nThe following years, progress has been steady. The refactoring of Morphic is essentially complete. The most important feature is that in Cuis, each morph defines its own coordinate system. Transformation to owner coordinates is an instance of the GeometryTransformation hierarchy, stored in the 'location' instance variable. This coordinate system is used by the Morph for its own drawing and also for positioning its submorphs.\n\nIn 2019, support was added to read and use TrueType fonts. In 2020 I made it possible to include VectorGraphics based morphs (including morphs built from SVG files) to a regular World. In 2021, I wrote a VM plugin for the VectorEngine, gaining enough performance to use VectorGraphics for all morphs, including browsers and other dev tools.\n"

        "text": "There are several other examples included, chosen to show the capabilities of the VectorGraphics engine and SVG support. Browse the class side of SVGMainMorph, category 'examples'. SVG support is quite complete, so you can also try other SVG files as well. Note that drawing complex SVG without the VectorEngine VM Plugin will slow down Cuis significantly. The Virtual Machine Plugin to enable fast drawing of vector graphics is integrated in the OpenSmalltalk Virtual Machine GitHub repository, but not yet in the official builds. In the meantime, you might run one of the VMs built by members of our community, that include the plugin: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rhkt4ayq24t2xbf/AACDb3mrjMUDB8Mptd-Bi6Zsa?dl=0\n\nIf you run Cuis with one of these VMs, and have selected a TrueType font as the system default, you'll see that the Morphic Halos include two new handles: \"Change Scale\" (center right) and \"Rotate\" (bottom left). Try them on any Morph!\n\n## History of development\n\nVector Graphics is actually what got the Cuis project started. In 2003, ten years before the Retina display, I (Juan Vuletich) decided that making Morphic zoomeable and independent of pixel resolution would require completely abandoning back compatibility with the existing Morphic in Squeak. I took Squeak 3.7 and started working on what would later be named Cuis Smalltalk.\n\nYou can see more about the early development of the projects at: [The Morphic 3 Project](http://www.jvuletich.org/Morphic3/Morphic3-200911.html), [Morphic 3 in action](http://www.jvuletich.org/Morphic3/Morphic3-201006.html), [First public presentation of the project (video)](http://www.jvuletich.org/Morphic3/Smalltalks2007/Smalltalks2007.html) and [A short history of Cuis](CuisHistory.md).\n\nA more recent landmark was in 2013, when a defensive disclosure on the techniques used in the project was published: [Prefiltering Antialiasing for General Vector Graphics](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267152327_Prefiltering_Antialiasing_for_General_Vector_Graphics), [(also here)](https://priorart.ip.com/IPCOM/000232657). This meant the code could now be open-sourced without worries of someone else trying to get a patent on it.\n\nThe following years, progress has been steady. The refactoring of Morphic is essentially complete. The most important feature is that in Cuis, each morph defines its own coordinate system. Transformation to owner coordinates is an instance of the GeometryTransformation hierarchy, stored in the 'location' instance variable. This coordinate system is used by the Morph for its own drawing and also for positioning its submorphs.\n\nIn 2019, support was added to read and use TrueType fonts. In 2020 I made it possible to include VectorGraphics based morphs (including morphs built from SVG files) to a regular World. In 2021, I wrote a VM plugin for the VectorEngine, gaining enough performance to use VectorGraphics for all morphs, including browsers and other dev tools.\n"
