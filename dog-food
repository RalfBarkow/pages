If you have a single, coherent group of developers, they tend to tread the same old trails over and over, thus not getting good coverage. Dogfooding helps you a lot in prioritizing your bugs. When you really use a product, you immediately spot the things that really annoy you and also those you can live with.\nAnyway, I think dogfooding improves perceived product quality a lot.",

Sometimes the developers are not good analogues for the customers. This is most dangerous when there is some relation between the product the customers want and the product the developers want. I've seen this when a development team was asked to develop a product for large teams of developers in large corporations. The product was developed in itself. The development team was small, highly technical, and not expert in the customer domains. They had a lot of input into the product's ongoing development, and the result was (in my opinion) a poor fit for customer needs (of course, it's really a failure of product marketing/management to not manage this). -- [[Paul Hudson]]",

My experience is that if you let enough people do serious work with something, you will catch a fair amount of bugs. The user (even if it's a developer) is a pretty good random generator of test cases. \nI guess the assumption behind dogfooding is that your task has enough in common with the customer's that the experiences you make in dogfooding are a good approximation of what the customers will see. The Microsoft example above is actually pretty good. If MS did take their dogfooding experiences seriously, we would have a more scalable Word. -- [[Thomas Maeder]]",
