He outlines a variety of alternative ways to approach a text. I return to this work regularly to help remind me of the various ethics, aims, and collaborations possible in reading. Thank you, Joe Dumit, for your generosity of thought and social relations, and particularly how those things come together in your academic work. After hearing your talk “Elementary Relations: Bromine in Self, Society and World” in Barcelona, I was so inspired to write about relations that I left the conference early, booked myself into a hotel, and started writing this book on every paper surface I could find (coasters and napkins from the hotel feature prominently in the first draft of this text). Thank you and your co-panelists—Michelle Murphy, Dimitris Papadopoulos, Cori Hayden, and Stefan Helmreich—for that talk. Dumit et al., “Elements Thinking t122.1”; Dumit, “How I Read.”"
