Its largest employers are in telecommunications, insurance, and defense-related industries. Some of their employees live in the community, but not in sufficient numbers to give the community a distinctive, industry-related identity. Most local residents work elsewhere. The companies themselves look to international and national markets and are affected by metropolitan-wide linkages with related industries. \"Local\" business people tend to be involved in aspects of the real-estate industry, a business that self-consciously creates place images, but not images that refer to the actual role of that industry in the community. The community name would bring greater recognition outside of California, especially in Texas, since it is the place where the Dallas Cowboys football team, \"America's Team,\" had for so many years prepared for its season."

Fires that occur near settlements are typically the work of arsonists using the stored natural fuels of this Mediterranean environment to their advantage. People live quite comfortably in the natural spillways of several dams, despite the presence of nearby faults and frequent tectonic activity. To speak of the natural world is usually to make reference to the [[Aesthetics]] associated with viewing nature."
