It’s rich in deeply powerful relationships, joyous and worthy learning and overseen by Believing Eyes and unwavering values. A foundation continuously tended and ploughed. The cultivation is never-ending. Perhaps the most indispensable component of a thriving school culture is a community that unrelentingly protects it. We see our culture as our legacy, what each member of our community leaves us with. We are overjoyed by what we have created. Is it perfect? No. Is it polished? No. It’s messy, it’s challenging but it’s incredibly rewarding. Most would say… It’s good to be Griffin!"
