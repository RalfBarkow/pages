Releasing on the internet can be considered thereafter.  \n- [[Declare Shared Purpose & Values]]\nThe core concept is [[neighborhood]], this has been explicitely declared relatively at the beginning of the process; high homogeneity of the group around that project. However, in the following process values have not been explicitely discussed and declared, denn die Wertehaltungen werden über die Projektidee und Projekte selbst immer wieder aktualisiert. Wobei es innerhalb dieses Rahmens diversifizierte Wertehaltungen gibt, was aber in der Gruppe nicht zu grundsätzlichen Konflikten wohl aber Diskussionen führt. Werte werden nicht abstrakt vorgegeben. \n- Set [[Semi-Permeable Boundaries]]\nSituativer Umgang mit Grenzen\n- [[Assure Commoners' Consent in Decisionmaking]]. There is no explicitly declared decision making principle but until now the group has never voted. Everything has been decided by consensus (that is: discussions until everybody agreed - which is not a big issue or a long debate.) Exception: election of \"Vorstand\" because it's prescribed by the law. But even there votings have been unanimous. \n- [[Relationalize Property]]. Property is not a big issue, as there are no assets, but so called \"intelectual property\" is a topic because the idea of Neustart Schweiz has its roots in the individual work of one person. This creation is gradually being shared and opened to be further developed.  \n- To [[Share Knowledge Often & Widely]] is a common practice.\n- [[Honor Transparency in a Sphere of Trust]]. an important dimension, not really a topic given the high homogeneity of the project\n- [[Respect Human Dimensions]] Is \"built in\" the concept of [[neighborhood]] but not explicitely discussed/ worked on at a group level. Everybody needs to care for him/herself, so to speak.\n- [[Direct Capital to Commons Provisioning]]\n- [[Self-Monitor & Sanction Gradually]] [or: Self-Monitor, Mediate & Sanction Gradually]]\n\n"
