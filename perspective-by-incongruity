It appeals by exemplifying relationships between objects which our customary rational vocabulary has ignored. Were we finally to accommodate ourselves, for instance, to placing the lion in the cat family, a poet might metaphorically enlighten us and startle us by speaking of \"that big dog, the lion\"—or were we completely inured to thinking of man as an ape, we might get a sudden flash, or perspective, from a reference to man as the \"ape-God\"."

The amusing moral perspectives offered  us by the Oscarians found their counterpart a few  decades later in the paradoxes of an Eddington, who  outrages our old categories of orientation by carrying his incongruous perspectives into the very structure of the universe. Eddington's perspectives are  written in the spirit of a cosmological Wilde."

The scandalizing power of this (sociologically understood) difference lay in the fact that it could be used to arrange psychological and social operations into a reciprocal system/environment relationship. Theory categorically separated social and psychological systems and then had to (re)develop or import pieces of theory that were able to deal with the unity of the thus separated, for example the pieces of theory of [[Interpenetration]] and [[Structural Coupling]]."
