Dabei soll, so weit möglich, zwischen den beschriebenen Phänomenen und ihrer Erklärung unterschieden werden. Die beobachteten Phänomene lassen sich nämlich meist auch mit anderen – manchmal ähnlichen, manchmal gegensätzlichen – Modellen erklären, die sich aus einem systemtheoretischen Ansatz ableiten lassen. Und je nachdem, welche Erklärung konstruiert wird, ändert sich dann die Bewertung dieser Phänomene. Aber auch umgekehrt: Seine Bewertungen verleiten den Beobachter immer wieder dazu, nur zu ihnen passende Phänomene wahrzunehmen und/oder alternative Erklärungen zu konstruieren.\n"
