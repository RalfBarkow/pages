In my youth, I shepherded groups on night walks in the tropical rainforests of North Queensland. Turning our torches off, and hearing the exclamations of wonder and awe as eyes adjusted and the luminescent fungi dominated the forest floor are vivid memories. This is also the joy I felt when a student experienced a learning breakthrough, or mastery over a process. Or when a sports team I had coached celebrated an applied, newly acquired skill in a game setting."

Or when a sports team I had coached celebrated an applied, newly acquired skill in a game setting."

        "text": "> The classic example of that backward intuition was my own introduction to [[Systems Analysis]], the [[World Model]]. Asked by the [[Club of Rome]] to show how major global problems — poverty and hunger, environmental destruction, resource depletion, urban deterioration, unemployment — are related and how they might be solved, Forrester made a computer model and came out with a clear leverage point (J.W. Forrester, World Dynamics, Portland OR, Productivity Press, 1971 [https://archive.org/details/worlddynamics00forr archive]): [[Growth]]. Not only population growth, but economic growth. Growth has costs as well as benefits, and we typically don’t count the costs — among which are poverty and hunger, environmental destruction, etc. — the whole list of problems we are trying to solve with growth! What is needed is much slower growth, much different kinds of growth, and in some cases no growth or negative growth. – [[Donella Meadows]]"
