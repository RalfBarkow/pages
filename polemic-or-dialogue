It is overdeveloped when he acts largely for theoretical reasons. And \"development\" is the progressive replacement of economic motives by theoretical ones. In making these definitions, I made use of some of Hannah Arendt's terms. However, I made them my own. According to this, action (the \"politics\") is a way of life motivated either by economics or by theory. Economy means that way of life in which man does not act (do) but works, theory, on the other hand, means that way of life in which man considers instead of acting. Politics (the active life) is an intermediate stage between economy and theory, between work and leisure. A situation would therefore be underdeveloped if in it I moved from work to action in order to free myself from work. And it would be overdeveloped if I moved from leisure to action in order to engage myself. In the field of politics, therefore, an underdeveloped situation could be well distinguished from an overdeveloped one: In the underdeveloped situation, politics is an attempt to free oneself from the slavery of economy, and in the overdeveloped situation, it is an attempt to free oneself from the boredom of leisure. These reflections are written in Brazil (i.e. in a situation generally described as \"underdeveloped\"). Seen from Europe, they illuminate the other side of the coin \"politics\"."

Discourse is a mode of communication in which one system is coupled to another by a channel through which information flows in one direction only. The purpose of discourse is to match the passive system to the active one through information (example teacher-student). The purposefulness of discourse distinguishes it from the purposelessness of dialogue. Discourse consists of a series of propositions, the first proposition being an intention and all the rest its consequences. As a design, the entire discourse is already contained in the resolution. The discourse is an explanation of the intention, with the aim that it is received as information by the receiver. The intention is the norm, the \"value\" of the discourse. The discourse is evaluative, imperative, even if its individual sentences seem like statements. like statements. Something volitional, exciamatory and declamatory lies in the structure of every discourse. This gives it its character, which is not only evaluative but also progressive. Examples of discourses are religions and ideologies; the best example is the natural sciences, where the normative character is not immediately obvious. But philosophy can also show that they start from intentions, raise these intentions to norms and then explain them. In short, discourse differs from dialogue not only by its monovalency, but also by the fact that it has deliberately set values for itself in order to communicate them to others. >> contain"

The two channels of communication run in parallel, so that polemics can be seen as a polemics can be seen as both a frustrated dialogue and two frustrated discourses. The theory of informa tion and dialectics provide models for this violent com m unication. Those who polemicize are truly active, and the will to realize values is even clearer in them than in genuine discourse. The ancients said of polemics that it was the father of all things."

      "text": "The overdeveloped situation leads to the dialogical life - makes it possible in the first place, because in it the polemic becomes superfluous by the fact that the intentional values have been exhausted. In such a situation, characterized by exhaustion, man condescends to play an active life, although he is theoretically convinced of the indifference of any action. This is the tolerant, open, unprejudiced mood of the real dialogue. It has arisen only rarely in the course of our history and has asserted itself only briefly. Examples of such moments are Plato's Athens, late 18th century England and America, and the developed world today. In Athens, the dialogue took place between philosophers (the utopian kings), in America between gentlemen (the utopian democrats), and currently between computers (the utopian governing machines). Plato's philosophy and Jefferson's theory of the state currently correspond to the theory of games.\nBut in the underdeveloped world the polemic continues. It should be clear that \"underdeveloped world\" is not a geographic but an existential concept. There are also overdeveloped, playful people in Brazil and underdeveloped, militant people in Europe. There are still people who actively strive to realize values and fight for them, who therefore lead an underdeveloped life. At present, however, it seems that the polemical battles that take place on the fringes of the developed world are not being\nare being transformed by computers dialoguing with each other into indifferent moves in the great game of world politics. And indeed, this aspect influences the polemicists who experience it as marginalization and deprivation of decision. Nevertheless, even if it is successful, the dialogue can be exhausted. Perhaps it is the polemic on the margins, the underdeveloped life, that decides the future?"

In such a situation, characterized by exhaustion, man condescends to play an active life, although he is theoretically convinced of the indifference of any action. This is the tolerant, open, unprejudiced mood of the real dialogue. It has arisen only rarely in the course of our history and has asserted itself only briefly. Examples of such moments are Plato's Athens, late 18th century England and America, and the developed world today. In Athens, the dialogue took place between philosophers (the utopian kings), in America between gentlemen (the utopian democrats), and currently between computers (the utopian governing machines). Plato's philosophy and Jefferson's theory of the state currently correspond to the theory of games.\nBut in the underdeveloped world the polemic continues. It should be clear that \"underdeveloped world\" is not a geographic but an existential concept. There are also overdeveloped, playful people in Brazil and underdeveloped, militant people in Europe. There are still people who actively strive to realize values and fight for them, who therefore lead an underdeveloped life. At present, however, it seems that the polemical battles that take place on the fringes of the developed world are not being\nare being transformed by computers dialoguing with each other into indifferent moves in the great game of world politics. And indeed, this aspect influences the polemicists who experience it as marginalization and deprivation of decision. Nevertheless, even if it is successful, the dialogue can be exhausted. Perhaps it is the polemic on the margins, the underdeveloped life, that decides the future?"
