Complex machines make for complicated behavior, usually, although Chaos has shown that simple ones can also, when feedback loops are positive. Software gets complex when we add new parts to it. Non-essential complexity happens when slightly different parts were added when sameness could have been achieved instead. I've seen several complex products that were at the threshold between workable and not workable, and there's a dynamic that tends to hold such products right at that seemingly fragile balance point. The problem is that most overly complicated products can be demonstrated to work at least a little. That's enough to satisfy developers overwhelmed by complication, but not enough to satisfy paying customers over the long haul. I once had to oversee a product whose author deemed it unmaintainable.

I think \"complex\" means \"many parts\", and implies the many relationships that exist among the parts. Also implied is that the parts are not all the same. Complex machines make for complicated behavior, usually, although Chaos has shown that simple ones can also, when feedback loops are positive. Software gets complex when we add new parts to it. Non-essential complexity happens when slightly different parts were added when sameness could have been achieved instead. I've seen several complex products that were at the threshold between workable and not workable, and there's a dynamic that tends to hold such products right at that seemingly fragile balance point. The problem is that most overly complicated products can be demonstrated to work at least a little. That's enough to satisfy developers overwhelmed by complication, but not enough to satisfy paying customers over the long haul. I once had to oversee a product whose author deemed it unmaintainable. No one else would touch it either, nor would the company pay to rewrite it. Does life get any better than this? -- [[Walden Mathews]]",
