And the Möbius dizziness is experienced by everyone who tries to think about something (whatever) radically. Maybe this is connected with the fact that we think with two hands, back and forth between the right and the left one. But the two hands can only be brought to coincide with each other in the fourth dimension, by a möbius-like rotation. Much easily this is the explanation for the fact that one has the impression to turn over gloves when doing philosophy. Not the notorious mirror, but the upturned glove is the tool of reflection.
