In Bologna, the left-liberal city government led by the Partito Democratico (PD) has announced a pilot project for a digital social credit system this fall. Similar to the loyalty points that can be collected in retail stores, the citizenry is to be invited to collect \"virtue points\" via a mobile phone app called \"Smart Citizen Wallet.\" Bonus points are to be awarded to those who separate garbage properly, use public transportation, do not commit misdemeanors, and use digital offerings for exchanges with the public administration. The bonus points are to be redeemable exclusively within the municipal economic cycle, for example in the form of discounts or privileged access to local services and cultural programs."

Working closely with Chinese technology company Huawei, Bugani promoted the Citizen Wallet platform as the foundation of digitally-driven urban transformation since 2019. However, the Roman experimental phase offered only a very limited bonus system; points could only be earned for cashless purchases of bus and metro tickets and participation in an online evaluation of the public administration's digital services. In Rome, the advertising campaign focused less on the virtuousness of the citizenry and more on the capital's position in the Italian ranking of so-called smart cities. The title \"Smart City\" is awarded to the municipality that uses digital strategies to ensure sustainable development on an economic, social and ecological level. In a national comparison, Rome is still behind the leading Italian \"smart cities\" Florence, Milan and Bologna."
