The production of more and more manufacturing knowledge is no longer illicit curiosity (curiositas), but at the same time admiration of creation and worship of God. But this reference to the super agent God is only a justification. It might satisfy theologians and keep them from intervening; but it reveals nothing about the structure of this theory, nothing about the meaning of its \"just so\", nothing about the advantage of this detour from making to knowing.\n"
