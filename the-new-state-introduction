We sought him through the method of representation and failed to find him.  We sought to reach him by extending the suffrage to every man and then to every woman and yet he eludes us.  Direct government now seeks the individual; but as we have not found him by sending more men to the ballot-box, so we shall not find him by sending men more often to the ballot-box.  Are our constitutional conventions to sit and congratulate themselves on their progressive ideas while they are condemning us to a new form of the old particularism?  The ballot- box!  How completely that has failed men, how completely it will fail women.  Direct government as at present generally understood is a mere phantom of democracy.  Democracy is not a sum in addition.  Democracy is not brute numbers; it is a genuine union of true individuals.  The question before the American people to-day is--How is that genuine union to be attained, how is the true individual to be discovered?  The party has always ignored him; it wants merely a crowd, a preponderance of votes.  The early reform associations had the same aim.  Both wanted voters not men.  It makes little difference whether we follow the boss or follow the good government associations, this is all herd life--\"following the herd\"--democracy means a wholly different kind of existence.  To follow means to murder the individual, means to kill the only force in the world which can make the Perfect Society--democracy depends upon the creative power of every man.",

A man said to me the other day, \"That is not democracy, that is mysticism.\"  But why mysticism?  It is our daily life as lived from hour to hour.  We join with one group of men at work, with another at play, another in our civic committee, another in our art club.  Man's life is one of manifold relatings.  His vote at the polls must express not his particularist self, but the whole complex of his related life, must express as much of the whole as these multiple relations have brought into existence for him, through him.  I find my expression of the whole-idea, the whole-will, through my group life.  The group must always dictate the modes of activity for the individual.  We must put clearly before us the true individual with his infinite relations, expressing his infinite relations, as the centre of politics, as the meaning of democracy.  The first purpose of genuine politics is to make the vote of every man express the All at his special coign (sic) of outlook.  In every man is the potential of such expression.

Democracy is not worked out at the polling-booths; it is the bringing forth of a genuine collective will, one to which every single being must contribute the whole of his complex life, as one which every single being must express the whole of at one point.  Thus the essence of democracy is creating.  The technique of democracy is group organization.  Many men despise politics because they see that politics manipulate, but make nothing.

Not by being \"granted\" or \"conferred.\"  Genuine control, power, authority are always a growth.  Self-government is a psychological process.  It is with that psychological process that this book is largely concerned.  To free the way for that process is the task of practical politics.",

The first reform needed in our political practice is to find some method by which the government shall continuously represent the people.  No state can endure unless the political bond is being forever forged anew.  The organization of men in small local groups gives opportunity for this continuous political activity which ceaselessly creates the state.  Our government forms cannot be fossils from a dead age, but must be sensitive, mobile channels for the quick and quickening soul of the individual to flow to those larger confluences which finally bring forth the state.  Thus every man *is* the state at every moment, whether in daily toil or social intercourse, and thus the state itself, leading a myriad-membered life, is expressing itself as truly in its humblest citizen as in its supreme assembly.",

It is a short way of saying that we are now looking at things not as entities but in relation.

We sought him through the method of representation and failed to find him.  We sought to reach him by extending the suffrage to every man and then to every woman and yet he eludes us.  Direct government now seeks the individual; but as we have not found him by sending more men to the ballot-box, so we shall not find him by sending men more often to the ballot-box.  Are our constitutional conventions to sit and congratulate themselves on their progressive ideas while they are condemning us to a new form of the old particularism?  The ballot- box!  How completely that has failed men, how completely it will fail women.  Direct government as at present generally understood is a mere phantom of democracy.  Democracy is not a sum in addition.  Democracy is not brute numbers; it is a genuine union of true individuals.  The question before the American people to-day is--How is that genuine union to be attained, how is the true individual to be discovered?  The party has always ignored him; it wants merely a crowd, a preponderance of votes.  The early reform associations had the same aim.  Both wanted voters not men.  It makes little difference whether we follow the boss or follow the good government associations, this is all herd life--\"following the herd\"--democracy means a wholly different kind of existence.  To follow means to murder the individual, means to kill the only force in the world which can make the Perfect Society--democracy depends upon the creative power of every man.",

I find my expression of the whole-idea, the whole-will, through my group life.  The group must always dictate the modes of activity for the individual.  We must put clearly before us the true individual with his infinite relations, expressing his infinite relations, as the centre of politics, as the meaning of democracy.

No state can endure unless the political bond is being forever forged anew.  The organization of men in small local groups gives opportunity for this continuous political activity which ceaselessly creates the state.  Our government forms cannot be fossils from a dead age, but must be sensitive, mobile channels for the quick and quickening soul of the individual to flow to those larger confluences which finally bring forth the state.  Thus every man *is* the state at every moment, whether in daily toil or social intercourse, and thus the state itself, leading a myriad-membered life, is expressing itself as truly in its humblest citizen as in its supreme assembly.",

My thanks are especially due to my teacher and counsellor of many years, Miss Anna Boynton Thompson, who went over the first copy of the manuscript with me and gave to it the most careful consideration and criticism, offering constantly invaluable suggestion and advice; to her unflagging and most generous help the final form owes more than I can quite express.  The inception of the book is due to my friends and fellow-workers, Mrs. Louis Brandeis, Mrs. Richard Cabot and Mr. Arthur Woodworth, as also much of its thought to the stimulus of \"group\" discussion with them.  Mrs. Charles W. Mixter, Professor Albert Bushnell Hart, Professor H.A. Overstreet, Professor W. Ernest Hocking and Mr. Roscoe Pound have read the manuscript in full or in part and have given me many valuable suggestions.  I owe to my friend, Miss Isobel L. Briggs, daily help, advice and encouragement in the development of the book, and the revision of manuscript and proofs. ",
