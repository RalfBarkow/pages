One of the agendas of DaO was very familiar to me: post-Fordism, the mode of capitalist economy and society that has arisen on the back of the digital. It’s been at the heart of my work since, in the GLC in the 80s, we began to engage the new ground of struggle constituted by the digital: skill and de- and re-skilling, radically altered products and services and practices, ‘mass customisation’ and the Benetton mode, and the production and assembly of actual material stuff *by writing* (that is, sitting in remote locations, mediated through software tools and digital networks) and the mobilising of hugely extended machine-systems that have no human intermediation (‘disintermediation’ is a big thing in internet business models). It took a lot of adjustment, and one of the things I see clearly now that isn’t clearly addressed in DaO (it’s hard to figure) is that the digital is in fact *a new kind of stuff*. The digital - as a form of stuff - is truly radical, regardless of what any particular user happens to be doing with it.\n\n"

And in the final section of DaO, when looking to assemble a package of policy recommendations, it’s notable that mostly they are environment-related. But this seemed odd, the policy frame seemed to somehow fall from the sky without being founded in any persistent attention to environment as a distinct ‘sphere’ in that important pamphlet, which primarily is concerned with the emergent ‘dance of provisioning’ across four grand sectors: state, market, household, mutual sector. \n"

As radicals, our relationship with ‘domesticated’ means tends to be addressed in terms of phases of capitalism - although the ‘long waves’ of techno-economic paradigms (machinofacture, Fordism, post-Fordism, etc \\[Perez xxx]) are actually, historically, rather short, spanning only the historical dominance of capital, leaving open the question of whether colonisation and ‘the Plantationocene’ is an older *parallel* and precedent, or a co-emergent *part of* this mode of economic organisation. \n\n"

Some of the relations of production of the digital seem rather like those of land (raw digital territories ‘wired for sound’, appearing ‘public’ and ‘free’ but with tolls, tithes and rents exacted by oligarchic corporations; which then trade commodities of attention-production with the old economy and make old-fashioned profits). I’m inclined to regard the era of digital means as *the Golemic*: the mythical Golem was a figure of clay, animated by placing a written scroll of significant wisdom (the Torah) in its mouth. The mythical Golem was powerful but stupid, whereas ‘the Golemic’ already can discriminate and respond to patterning very finely, if intensively trained. \n\n"

        "text": "Second, commoning of *prosthesis*. The relationships that humans have with some means is so close that they function as prostheses, sometimes beneficially (as with contact lenses, pacemakers, artificial hips) and sometimes addictively and harmfully (as with junk foods, cosmetic surgery, ‘recreational’ drugs; and smartphones and their apps and media). There are questions about whether and in what ways these are ’needs’ or means of wellbeing: addiction, as distinct from necessity and skilful, intentional dependence. This same school could engage also with Companion species: the almost symbiotic relationships that our species has with non-human species. In both cases there are questions regarding where ‘the human’ ends and what kinds of distributed identity or existence are constructed (addictively, dependently, beneficially? inescapably? and who says?) across species and across the spectrum of human and non-living entities. These practices clearly are strongly present in landscape §3; but the de facto production of many of them is deep down in the belly of the received economy and the mechanics of available ‘stuff’ (not to mention pharmaceutical capitalism, for example), while the efficacy of some others in generating trans-species wellbeing is barely considered, and is certainly ‘not economic’ in any direct sense.\n\n"

We’ve been in the nano era for more than a century, it began with the first plastics, when molecular structures were modified or synthesised on a industrial scale, creating materials with ‘unnatural’ properties. This is the origin of the absurdly durable plastics that now are going feral. But practices of modifying and generating materials and living organisms or organs at the atomic, molecular, genetic or cellular level are set to ramp-up enormously - all the way from graphene and 3D-printed organic semiconducting fabrics, via GM crops (and patent-protected heritage species), to designer-eugenics and mood cosmetics. Human capabilities for both valuing such practices and for containing the resulting materials (*pace* plastics in the oceanic food chain, planet-wide) are far too far away from the capability to make them, for our grandchildren’s grandchildren to sleep safe at nights. This perspective sits with the ‘over the horizon and under the radar’ brief of the Faculty of stewarding, but it makes sense for the school to live alongside other materials- and provisioning-oriented families. It sits very close the the school of Digital means, for example.\n\n"

It might be, for example, that some elaboration of ‘design circle’ formations is a place to start.

        "text": "---\n\nNext: [[Warp - Zones of reach and the scope of an activist life]]\nA further dimension remains to be defined in the framing of a curriculum of making a living economy. The three ‘weft’ landscapes §1 §2 §3 give traction on the material structure of economy, and of practice per se. But considering formaciòn - the skilful production of *formations* of activist practice, within skilfully conducted activist lives (yes, we have just the one; and the clock ticks; and all is emergent in a *life*, as distinct from in *society*) - we need also to have a framing of what, in contrast with structure, is usually called agency. Thus, the warp of the foprop conceptual weave is constituted by four *¿zones of reach*. What kind of reach does an activist or a formation of activists have? what kind of reach is needed? What kind of scope can be subtended by a practice, if effectively informed through institutions of formaciòn? These zones are the basis of the faculty structure of the college. I use the symbol ¿ - pronounced ‘zone’ - to highlight this aspect of the weave.\n\nThe zones are founded on the landscapes. Each landscape offers a certain kind of reach to the activist, through an engagement with a certain range of material. Cast in terms of reach and agency, then, we can construct a span of zones, each of which has one of the landscapes at its generative, perceptual, intentional, orientating core:\n- ¿1 - *In-here* - based on landscape §3: Aesthetic. This zone is constituted by mobilising what is present ‘in-here’, in skilfully responding to an ocean (or plentitude) of in-heres, ‘out-there’. Here we - the activist, the person skilfully conducting an activist life - are handling *forces* in the preconscious and intersubjective, phenomenological field: moment-by-moment. This is skilful stuff. This zone is the foundation of the *Faculty of care work*.\n- ¿2 *Here* - based on landscape §1: Material. This zone is constituted by mobilising stuff out-there, to meet material needs in-here. Here we’re handling *forms* of material organisation and machinery; this is the field of technics and technique, logistics, manual skill, built environment, urban space, manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare. ‘Here’ is where we necessarily have contacts, get our material needs met; it’s where our body is. This zone is the foundation of the *Faculty of subsistence work*.\n- ¿3 *We* - based on landscape §2: Cultural. This zone is constituted by mobilising in-here, to know and organise out-there. Here we’re handling *formations* of labour power; this is the field of relationships with others who concern themselves with the same kinds of things that we do, look at things in the same kind of way; or complement our capacity to see, know and organise. This zone is the foundation of the *Faculty of formaciòn work*. In this regard, it is at the heart of the college.\nThere’s then a fourth ¿zone to be recognised which may arise, as a perception and a need, in any landscape:\n- ¿4 - *Region* - This zone is constituted by attempts to bring what’s moving out-there - ‘over the horizon’ - into well-modulated mutual relationship with other things moving out-there (or equally, under the radar). Here we’re attempting to handle a relationship with very large or very deep things: practices beyond the scope of knowable community, tacit processes in Deep time, species evolution, the fact that there is No Planet B, the circumstances of our grandchildren’s grandchildren. This zone is the foundation of the *Faculty of stewarding work*.\n\nBecause each zone is in a sense ‘bigger’ or ‘smaller’ than others, it may seem that this is a hierarchy. But these four constitute a *span* of zones of reach not a hierarchy because, as perceptions, orientations and intentions, any of them may rise in their turn to the top of the stack of awareness, and as such, all are ‘the same size’: the size of a human mind. The issue is to enlarge the mind. And to cycle the awarenesses. And to mobilise stuff in the three landscapes. It’s the work of the college to facilitate all of these.\n(img)\nSchema - Warp: four ¿zones of reach\n(img)\nSchema: College faculties (and schools\n\nThe weaving of the schools’ practice, across the families of pattern and across the Faculties, is the ‘hidden curriculum’ of the college. Genre and skill (the tacit elements in a dance of knowing) are stronger in the contribution of the college than the explicit curriculum, of conceptualisation and storytelling. It’s time to consider the dance of knowing."

It’s been at the heart of my work since, in the GLC in the 80s, we began to engage the new ground of struggle constituted by the digital: skill and de- and re-skilling, radically altered products and services and practices, ‘mass customisation’ and the Benetton mode, and the production and assembly of actual material stuff *by writing* (that is, sitting in remote locations, mediated through software tools and digital networks) and the mobilising of hugely extended machine-systems that have no human intermediation (‘disintermediation’ is a big thing in internet business models). It took a lot of adjustment, and one of the things I see clearly now that isn’t clearly addressed in DaO (it’s hard to figure) is that the digital is in fact *a new kind of stuff*.

This emerging economy can be seen in many fields, including the environment, care, education, welfare, food and energy. It combines some old elements and many new ones. I describe it as a ‘social economy’ because it melds features which are very different from economies based on the production and consumption of commodities.\n\n\n"
