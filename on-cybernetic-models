There are two clear exceptions, Stafford Beer in the construction of the Viable System Model, and Peter Checkland in the construction of Soft Systems Methodology. These two authors frame their approach in a [[Transformation Process]], the purpose of which lies in the eye of the beholder/[[Observer]] defining the process, and characterised by its relationship to its [[Context]]. I start from the Heraclitian notion that in the world in which we find ourselves **all is flux and change**. Using the frame developed by Beer and Checkland, I propose that this process view is fundamental to developing models and understanding of the [[Stability]] we find in phenomena in our world. I explore the necessary structures to achieve [[Coherence]] and [[Adaptability]] and show that the [[Learning Process]] is essential. I designate this approach **'systemic process thinking'**, and show that it can be considered a distinct paradigm which fits the Heraclitian view of **a dynamic world**. lt is necessarily [[Constructivist]], improves on **Whitehead's [[Process Philosophy]]**, and has considerable modelling power. I also show how the Western WEIRD approach has been derived from this."

For example, when exploring maps in an atlas, you will know to be careful in the way in which you interpret a map of the world. To map the world, the spherical earth must be flattened so that it may be drawn on a page. The two dimensional framing putting the map on a page inevitably distorts the relationships between different parts of the territory making calculations of distances problematic. Using coordinates appropriate to a flat page to describe geometric shapes on the curved surface of a sphere can be done, but leads to complexity and difficulties in understanding. Whereas putting the map on a globe and using latitude and longitude or spherical coordinates as the basis for the modelling makes the distance calculations as simple as possible. The **shared [[symmetry]]**, between the frame chosen and the [[Situation]] being modelled simplifies the understanding and the calculations. In many situations under scrutiny symmetry between the [[Base Frame]] and the situation under investigation plays a guiding role in choosing an appropriate modelling basis."

The developments in the 17th century in science and philosophy established the dominance of this approach (Deely 2001, Diamond zor:). The development of calculus by Newton and Leibniz overcame the problem of modelling [[Motion]] in Parmenides' static conception, so that this approach became the accepted **way of thinking about thinking**.

      "text": "WEIRD thinking leads to the belief in a 'real world' which can be termed naive or direct realism. The belief in this 'real world' gave rise to the idea of knowledge detached and independent of the knower. Thus 'objective' has in common usage come to be an adjective in the description of a situation, or reportage which carries the meaning that this is the 'correct' or 'real' view that all should believe, independent of any particular observer. As a result of the success of the WEIRD approach originally in physics, other disciplines, including biology, psychology and economics, also adopted this worldview. From there this worldview became dominant in the Western world (Deely 2001). WEIRD thinking is an approach that informs us directly of things and their attributes, assumed to be a description of the thing as it is, rather than what we would perceive in the particular circumstances in which we were looking. WEIRD thinking does account for the geometrical sense of [[perspective]] perfectly adequately in that we understand that objects that have [[Spatial]] extent can appear in various forms due to distance or their 3-dimensional shape, but there is much more to the concept of perspective as I will describe."

      "text": "In contradistinction to the WEIRD approach my starting point is the alternative that Aristotle describes in which [[Purpose]] is central. It is therefore a [[Teleological]] approach. The purposeful rationale of Aristotle's house perhaps can be better described in the form of a **process which transforms a constantly changing variable** environment on the outside to a calm interior conducive to comfortable living. Unfortunately, most of Heraclitus' writing is lost but we do know from the references that have survived that the writing of Heraclitus (c540-480BCE) (Khan 1979) was considered very important in his own and later times. His underpinning philosophy has been interpreted as **'all is flux and change'**. We must note that whilst the environments of all living forms change, living forms survive and through their lifetimes remain identifiably themselves. However, after the ancient Greek philosophers it wasn't until the 1878 publication of Claude Bernard's _Les Phenomdnes de la Vie_ that it was noted that that it was remarkable that in a world of constant change the **internal environment of animals remained constant**. Walter Canon in his 1932 book _The Wisdom of the Body_ coined the term '[[homeostasis]]' for this phenomenon. In an environment of flux and change the question that needs to be answered then is: - how is this stability achieved? The answer to this question lies in the science of _[[cybernetics]]_ defined by Norbert Wiener as \"the science of control in the animal and the machine\" (Wiener 1948). The science of cybernetics gave rise to the more general discipline of Systems Thinking, but in the beginning it all remained within the extant WEIRD paradigm. However, in the late 1970's and early 1980's two authors, Peter Checkland and Stafford Beer, framed their work differently."

      "text": "Peter Checkland (1981) had come up against the weakness of the extant systemic approaches based within an object frame while exploring the use of Systems Thinking to understand and **manage organisational problems**. He found that standard techniques failed and as a result developed the approach which he called [[Soft Systems Methodology]] (SSM). This approach takes the key step into the teleological process world by setting a _[[Root Definition]]_ as the starting point for building a systemic model which is a [[Process Model]]. The Root Definition defines the **relationship between the model to be constructed using the systemic frame and the environment of this process**. Thus the model to be constructed has the form of a [[Purposeful Input]] (from the process environment) -> [[Process]] -> [[Output]] (to the process environment) structure. I will use the word 'purpose' rather than Root Definition to define this **co-evolutionary relationship between a system and its environment** following Beer (Beer 1979; 1985). However, it should be noted that in common usage the word 'purpose' does not generally mean the whole of the relationship of the system to its environment but usually relates **only to one major output** of the system concerned. For example, the purpose of a nuclear power plant is usually thought of as the production of electricity, one output, but with no reference to [[Waste]] which we still cannot safely deal with, another output, nor indeed any reference to the necessary inputs."

It does this by encouraging the various [[Participant]]s to define their own purpose leading to their own subsequent system models. If no agreement can be reached on a single purpose, the SSM process thereafter encourages the participants to seek agreement on possible [[action]] to be taken, without necessarily moving from their their own systemic modelling of the situation. Hence the purpose of SSM is to move from a position where participants in a complex problem situation have different perspectives on that situation and understand the situation differently, to one where **problem-solving action is agreed, despite those multiple perspectives**."

The most important contributor to an understanding of process and its associated philosophy was [[Alfred North Whitehead]] (Whitehead 1978). The first publication of [[Process and Reality]] in 1929 preceded the development of Systems Thinking. Whitehead’s formulation of his [[Process Philosophy]] relates directly to the systemic process formulation (Asby 2021, 134). Whitehead’s central idea is an ‘actual occasion’, that is a situation point in time where a person perceives the need to respond. In Whitehead’s formulation an ‘actual occasion’ comes into being by drawing on, in his language ‘[[Prehending]]’ past actual occasions in a process of ‘[[Concrescence]]’; the many past actual occasions coming together to form the one present actual occasion. In Whitehead’s nomenclature the ‘this’ and ‘that’ of ‘subject’ and ‘object’ now refer to the [[Current]] actual occasion and the [[Past]] actual occasions. When the subject actual occasion B prehends an object actual occasion A, it imposes its perspective. As a result, this process draws from A only the aligned elements of data, and eliminates those elements of A which are not aligned to B’s perspective. Whitehead refers to this as the carrying over of [[Feelings]] from A to B. The use of the word ‘feeling’ extends the usual usage but carries the same meaning e.g. a **feeling of anger** might be carried forward from one occasion to another. Whitehead’s terms, actual occasion, subject, object, feeling, are evidence of an object-based approach which makes the language and formulation of the ideas at odds with the underlying ideas he wishes to convey. [[Donald W. Sherburne]] (1966) describes Whitehead’s approach as an ‘[[Atomistic System]]’ referring back to the ancient Greek Philosopher Democritus, the originator of the idea of a fundamental particle of matter which is in concept an object. However, the systemic approach developed by Beer, which is the foundation of Beer’s and Checkland’s approach, conceptually aligns with the processes that the modelling is seeking to represent. In this systemic approach the relationships between purposeful systems, the inputs and outputs, are conceptualised as [[Dynamic Flows]], flows of information and/or of material. Whitehead’s formulation can be related to this systemic process approach by considering snapshots taken at different times corresponding to the ‘actual occasions; the evolution, the ‘prehending’ taking place between snapshots. From a systemic point of view **Whitehead’s formulation is an object-based formulation** in the traditional scientific way, and secondly **Whitehead avoids any hint of teleology** as would be expected from in a traditional scientific argument even though clearly processes are teleological (Asby 2021)."

Both these possibilities increase the variety of responses available to environmental disturbance and therefore according to the Law of Requisite Variety increase the chance of survival. _(Create an arrows diagram with Robin Asby to illustrate these relationships, this system of learning.)_"

      "text": "These two learning processes, recognising difference and recognising similarity, can be designated [[Open Learning]] and [[Constrained Learning]]. The existence of a **new schema-system will open new possibilities**. On the other hand, the development of sub-systems to an existing system will be constrained to possibilities of recognition and action already experienced but now refined. George Lakoff (2008) proposes that ‘conservative thought’ is framed in a [[Hierarchy of Authority]]. Anyone is free to act as long as they act within the rules laid down. Clearly, within such a system all learning is constrained. Accepting unquestioningly a particular frame allows only the possibility of elaborating response sub-systems within that frame; constrained learning. Lakoff proposes that ‘progressive thought’ is built on [[Caring]] and [[Empathy]] together with the [[Responsibility]] and [[Strength to Act]] on that. Having empathy entails not requiring conformance within a particular frame but being **open to learning from others** and their way of living. Within a framework of [[Protection]] and [[Empowerment]] people can come together to interact with each other despite their differences. If they do this they will, through comparing and contrasting their own ways of living with other ways of living, learn of the commonalities through the process of open learning. Further support for this model of learning comes from the work of [[William Perry]] (1999) which describes in general terms **how a mind develops** principally using open learning as described above but in some cases only developing to a point beyond which embracing the uncertainty implied by the complexity of that person’ environment seems **overwhelming**, and there is a **reversion to constrained learning**."

We each construct our own world from our own personal experiences. Each of us has, as a result of our own unique set of past experiences, a **[[mindset]] of mental models** from which we construct our own perspective on any situation we encounter. This means that the same pattern of signals will be perceived differently by different people; each will perceive and interpret that pattern according to their particular [[mindset]]. Each will construct models of the same **object???** as a system from their mindset which reflects their perspective. An accountant designing a hospital with the purpose of minimising costs will design that hospital rather differently from a doctor designing that hospital with the purpose of providing the best patient experience. In these two cases the hospital’s relationship to its community will not be the same. This is not to suggest that each of these people is unable to embrace the other perspective through learning, but that we are **dependent on the mindset we have in the moment**."

My brain singles out a section of that scene because it **perceives a boundary**. Light is scattered by something in my visual field which **appears as a coherent whole**. Light falls on what we term an **object**, and is scattered by that object to my eyes. What I see is a system; light, the input, is scattered, the process, and my eyes receive the output of the scattering process. Subsequently if I change my perspective to this something I see for the first time, the scattering produces a different image but my brain will automatically synthesise the perceptions from these observations using open learning as described above. I would be developing a schema-system from the synthesis of the commonalities of my different observations. If I go on to take more observations, then all the time I am enhancing my schema-system model. As Piaget (1954) describes, this normally happens naturally, early in life, when an infant starts to move about, changing its perspective on the world it finds itself in."

But **it is that single step, the single observation, which is fundamental** – my ‘object’ model is built from many such single steps.

It is my brain which then over time, using open learning, synthesises these different patterns to form the schema-system model. The schema-system model and those many relationships are telescoped into no relationship at all in the abstract. But the model in my head is still a **schema-system model ready for use when that object appears** in my visual field. The processes of synthesis of different perspectives into an object model honed by evolution works well in perceiving and reacting to events in the natural world, but when we come to complex situations, for example understanding a functioning hospital, with **variety beyond our capacity to span**, we are **misled by our [[Assumption of Object]]**. We are each limited and encased in our own limited **‘bell jar’ of experience** (Plath 1966). But if we are open to learning, those limits expand as Perry describes."

Thus, there is always an **interplay** between **system and object** as Aristotle suggests. **Systemic process models abstracted from specific experiences are the fundamental building blocks from which object models are constructed.** That models are constructed, either through lifetime learning, or species learning becomes the central tenet of understanding the development of a brain and nervous system. This works well in coping with the world around us, but we then carry this learning into situations in which it does not apply. Both the failure of Checkland’s initial attempts at solving complex management problems and his subsequent great success with Soft Systems Methodology are explained by the understanding that the **systemic process approach** brings."

Western thinking and, in particular, Western scientific thinking is based firmly within the first and second of these and has either rejected the last two as invalid or, with Nagel, attempts to explain them as derived from the first two.

Framing the world in terms of objects will result in a rather simplistic world view compared to one built on being aware that in complex situations a multiplicity of different possibilities exists. Being unaware that different starting perspectives assume without **recognition different purposes** in constructing a view leads to much misunderstanding. Evolution has equipped Homo sapiens with a more sophisticated brain and nervous system than other mammals, but it **evolved in a context of small hunter gatherer tribes**. Whilst there were differences in aspects of culture across the world, those differences were seldom encountered, and lifestyles had much in common. Technology has massively increased our ability to communicate across both time and space but also the variety of life experiences. A city banker has little life experience in common with a migrant agricultural worker. We assume that a communication once sent will be understood as we intended. But that is hardly ever the case. In hindsight it is not unexpected that the primary and ‘natural’ systemic process way of thinking is that practised throughout history and most of the world. And also, as might be expected, the Western way of thinking has arisen as a sophistication which enables flexibility but we **pay a price by losing precision and losing sight of the dynamic interconnectedness of the world around us.**"

        "text": "Stafford Beer spent time in India during the Second World War, and during that time made a study of [[Eastern Philosophy]] to add to his previous study of [[Western Philosophy]]. This experience gave him a perspective unrestrained by WEIRD thinking and set him on a unique path over subsequent years. The transition from an object base to a process base, synthesising his Western and Eastern experiences can be traced through his writings in the development of the Viable System Model. This development evolves from [[Cybernetics and Management]] (1959), written from a Western scientific perspective, to [[Heart of Enterprise]] (1979) which starts with a clear statement of the subjective process nature of process modelling i.e. using the frame of a purposeful input -> process -> output structure. At the outset Beer says:"

        "text": "# Whitehead’s Process Philosophy\nThe focus on process as the centre of the systemic process definition input → process → output, and the systemic process models being interconnected networks of processes, brings the concept of process to the fore. The most important contributor to an understanding of process and its associated philosophy was Alfred North Whitehead (Whitehead 1978). The first publication of Process and Reality in 1929 preceded the development of Systems Thinking. Whitehead’s formulation of his Process Philosophy relates directly to the systemic process formulation (Asby 2021, 134). Whitehead’s central idea is an ‘actual occasion’, that is a situation point in time where a person perceives the need to respond. In Whitehead’s formulation an ‘actual occasion’ comes into being by drawing on, in his language ‘prehending’ past actual occasions in a process of ‘concrescence’; the many past actual occasions coming together to form the one present actual occasion. In Whitehead’s nomenclature the ‘this’ and ‘that’ of ‘subject’ and ‘object’ now refer to the current actual occasion and the past actual occasions. When the subject actual occasion B prehends an object actual occasion A, it imposes its perspective. As a result, this process draws from A only the aligned elements of data, and eliminates those elements of A which are not aligned to B’s perspective. Whitehead refers to this as the carrying over of feelings from A to B. The use of the word ‘feeling’ extends the usual usage but carries the same meaning e.g. a feeling of anger might be carried forward from one occasion to another. Whitehead’s terms, actual occasion, subject, object, feeling, are evidence of an object-based approach which makes the language and formulation of the ideas at odds with the underlying ideas he wishes to convey. Donald W. Sherburne (1966) describes Whitehead’s approach as an ‘atomistic system’ referring back to the ancient Greek Philosopher Democritus, the originator of the idea of a fundamental particle of matter which is in concept an object. However, the systemic approach developed by Beer, which is the foundation of Beer’s and Checkland’s approach, conceptually aligns with the processes that the modelling is seeking to represent. In this systemic approach the relationships between purposeful systems, the inputs and outputs, are conceptualised as dynamic flows, flows of information and/or of material. Whitehead’s formulation can be related to this systemic process approach by considering snapshots taken at different times corresponding to the ‘actual occasions; the evolution, the ‘prehending’ taking place between snapshots. From a systemic point of view Whitehead’s formulation is an object-based formulation in the traditional scientific way, and secondly Whitehead avoids any hint of teleology as would be expected from in a traditional scientific argument even though clearly processes are teleological (Asby 2021)."

        "text": "The two learning processes taken together form a simple but powerful learning mechanism, which increases the range and accuracy of recognition and response and permits the interpolation of new levels within existing recognition and response systems. These two learning abilities, recognising difference and recognising similarity, are rather simple to describe in these systemic terms. In the first case I am developing the ability to differentiate between two similar processes where a singular recognition and response system is refined into two or more sub-systems. In the second case, I identify a schema common to two different recognition and response systems and then use that schema to guide reaction to a new situation. A schema-system once developed from two systems, can give rise to new sub-systems using the first learning process. Both these possibilities increase the variety of responses available to environmental disturbance and therefore according to the Law of Requisite Variety increase the chance of survival."

        "text": "The second way of extending possible response patterns is to develop the ability to respond to new challenges - those that have never been met before. A living entity in a changing environment will naturally need to modify its responses as its environment changes, but will also need to cope with challenges that it has not encountered before. This second ability is a more powerful way of increasing the variety of possible control responses, and significantly increasing the variety of potential command. At any one time a brain and nervous system will contain sets of mental models for use in different situations. These sets of models are not necessarily connected. I suspect we have all experienced meeting someone out of their usual context and finding it difficult to identify them. Recognising the context we are able to choose response models appropriate to that environmental circumstance. I therefore propose that a brain and nervous system has the ability to review and compare models from different circumstances and extract from that comparison what is common. That new common pattern of recognition and response can then be used to evaluate and react to new experiences that have commonalities of pattern with the original models. Piaget (1954) describes a number of examples of young children exhibiting multiple models prior to synthesis, for example:"

It is my brain which then over time, using open learning, synthesises these different patterns to form the schema-system model. The schema-system model and those many relationships are telescoped into no relationship at all in the abstract. But the model in my head is still a schema-system model ready for use when that object appears in my visual field. The processes of synthesis of different perspectives into an object model honed by evolution works well in perceiving and reacting to events in the natural world, but when we come to complex situations, for example understanding a functioning hospital, with variety beyond our capacity to span, we are misled by our assumption of object. We are each limited and encased in our own limited ‘bell jar’ of experience (Plath 1966). But if we are open to learning, those limits\nexpand as Perry describes."

Once my brain has built that schema-system model, it recognises the object, very quickly from the pattern of scattered light reaching my eyes from any observational perspective."

My brain singles out a section of that scene because it perceives a boundary. Light is scattered by something in my visual field which appears as a coherent whole. Light falls on what we term an object, and is scattered by that object to my eyes. What I see is a system; light, the input, is scattered, the process, and my eyes receive the output of the scattering process. Subsequently if I change my perspective to this something I see for the first time, the scattering produces a different image but my brain will automatically synthesise the perceptions from these observations using open learning as described above. I would be developing a schema-system from the synthesis of the commonalities of my different observations. If I go on to take more observations, then all the time I am enhancing my schema-system model. As Piaget (1954) describes, this normally happens naturally, early in life, when an infant starts to move about, changing its perspective on the world it finds itself in."

This means that the same pattern of signals will be perceived differently by different people; each will perceive and interpret that pattern according to their particular mindset. Each will construct models of the same object as a system from their mindset which reflects their perspective. An accountant designing a hospital with the purpose of minimising costs will design that hospital rather differently from a doctor designing that hospital with the purpose of providing the best patient experience. In these two cases the hospital’s relationship to its community will not be the same. This is not to suggest that each of these people is unable to embrace the other perspective through learning, but that we are dependent on the mindset we have in the moment."

In my teaching experience students, having been trained in a Western tradition, have great difficulty in appreciating the necessary change to thinking in process terms. Authors writing on systems thinking and cybernetics whilst accepting the Newtonian frame slip into a process frame and seem unclear of the frame in which they are writing. I would propose that there is a clear distinction between the ‘object’ and ‘process’ frames which should be investigated further.\n"

        "text": "# Conclusion\nUnderlying my systemic process approach is that ‘out there’ is understood as a network of interacting systems that I perceive, but models are developed to the point that systems can be recognised from multiple perspectives and now thought of as objects. Thus, there is always an interplay between system and object as Aristotle suggests. Systemic process models abstracted from specific experiences are the fundamental building blocks from which object models are constructed. That models are constructed, either through lifetime learning, or species learning becomes the central tenet of understanding the development of a brain and nervous system.\nThis works well in coping with the world around us, but we then carry this learning into situations in which it does not apply. Both the failure of Checkland’s initial attempts at solving complex management problems and his subsequent great success with Soft Systems Methodology are explained by the understanding that the systemic process approach brings.\nDriven by the enormous success of Western thinking as a foundation for scientific advance, philosophical attempts have been made to explain\nholistic approaches in terms of WEIRD thinking – e.g. Nagel (1961). Nagel defined four types of explanation which he labelled 1) The deductive model; 2) probabilistic explanations; 3) functional or teleological explanations;\n4) genetic explanations. Western thinking and, in particular, Western scientific thinking is based firmly within the first and second of these and has either rejected the last two as invalid or, with Nagel, attempts to explain them as derived from the first two. I turn that argument on its head and explain object thinking in terms of systemic process thinking.\nThere are vital differences between systems constructed with different purposes in mind, and as Beer (1966) notes, discussions between politicians with different perspectives find it very difficult to reach agreement.\nFraming the world in terms of objects will result in a rather simplistic world view compared to one built on being aware that in complex situations a multiplicity of different possibilities exists. Being unaware that different starting perspectives assume without recognition different purposes in constructing a view leads to much misunderstanding. Evolution has equipped Homo sapiens with a more sophisticated brain and nervous system than other mammals, but it evolved in a context of small hunter gatherer tribes. Whilst there were differences in aspects of culture across the world, those differences were seldom encountered, and lifestyles had much in common. Technology has massively increased our ability to communicate across both time and space but also the variety of life experiences. A city banker has little life experience in common with a migrant agricultural worker. We assume that a communication once sent will be understood as we intended. But that is hardly ever the case. In hindsight it is not unexpected that the primary and ‘natural’ systemic process way of thinking is that practised throughout history and most of the world. And also, as might be expected, the Western way of thinking has arisen as a sophistication which enables flexibility but we pay a price by losing precision and losing sight of the dynamic interconnectedness of the world around us.\n"

A living entity in a changing environment will naturally need to modify its responses as its environment changes, but will also need to cope with challenges that it has not encountered before. This second ability is a more powerful way of increasing the variety of possible control responses, and significantly increasing the variety of potential command. At any one time a brain and nervous system will contain sets of mental models for use in different situations. These sets of models are not necessarily connected. I suspect we have all experienced meeting someone out of their usual context and finding it difficult to identify them."

        "text": "# The Additional Cybernetic Frame\nHolding steady in a changing environment is achieved in all circumstances through exemplifications of the basic control model. In the late 1940s and early 1950s it was recognised that the mathematical modelling of control systems in different disciplines had produced the same understanding, and a series of conferences, the Macy Conferences (Foerster editor 1951) were held to explore these issues. It was recognised that the control model is a schema system which can be recognised in all such situations. For a cybernetic frame I therefore add the following precepts to those above.\n1. The basic control model of cybernetics is defined as consisting of a system to be controlled; a sensor on the system to detect a variable to be controlled; a comparator to compare the actual value detected by the sensor with a required value input from outside, and an actuator to operate on the system to cause return to the required value in case of deviation.\n2. Control is subject to Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety (Ashby 1956). W. Ross Ashby was a British psychiatrist who first demonstrated the importance of variety in understanding control. The number of possible states of a system is what is defined as the variety of the system. Variety here has a technical systemic meaning which fortunately more or less coincides with its usual meaning. He showed that, in order to achieve sustainable control of a system, the variety of control actions by a controller must be at least equal to the variety of the disturbances which the system could be subject to. This is the Law of Requisite Variety. For example, the state of a motor vehicle travelling along a road is described by its lateral position on the road and its speed along the road, so we need at least control systems to manage these two variables – the person driving is the comparator, and needs the steering mechanism, and the accelerator-brake combination to arrive safely at their destination.\n3. Control is subject to the Conant-Ashby Theorem (Conant & Ashby 1970). The Conant-Ashby Theorem follows from the Law of Requisite Variety and states that the quality of control of a situation depends upon the quality of the model built into the controller. For example, in slippery road conditions the number of potential states of the car system increases: normal driving does not include skids. Understanding how a car behaves in those conditions, having a superior, higher variety model of car behaviour and how to control it, makes for a more skilled and safer driver. If the variety of potential command, i.e. the variety of control actions of the control system, is inadequate, control will not be maintained. Control situations are inherently complex because they involve parts of a system relating to each other in a fractal structure. Relating means communications taking place between the parts of a system. The communication channels are two-way feedback structures. Beer, from his practical management experience came to the conclusion that it is the way in which a human organisation relates to its environment and the way in which the parts of any organisation relate to each other that determines how that organisation evolves through time.\n4. A control system is subject to the Suboptimisation Theorem (Katz and Kahn in Systems Thinking, Emory ed.). The Sub-optimisation Theorem states that optimisation of a whole system cannot be achieved by separately optimising the parts. In any system there will always be a requirement for restrictions on the freedom of action of the sub-units in order to maintain cohesion of the whole. In other words, there must be feedback control loops whose purpose is to restrict the freedom of action of sub-units so that the coherence of the whole system can be maintained.\nThe fractal nature of an organisational structure requires that control systems populate the model in the same fractal way. It is from these underlying ideas that Beer developed his Viable System Model as a model of what is necessary and sufficient for a human organisation to be capable of adapting to a changing environment. (Asby 2021) has extended the VSM approach to model how animals act, react, and adapt to a changing environment."

In the late 1940s and early 1950s it was recognised that the mathematical modelling of control systems in different disciplines had produced the same understanding, and a series of conferences, the Macy Conferences (Foerster editor 1951) were held to explore these issues. It was recognised that the control model is a schema system which can be recognised in all such situations. For a cybernetic frame I therefore add the following precepts to those above.\n1. The basic control model of cybernetics is defined as consisting of a system to be controlled; a sensor on the system to detect a variable to be controlled; a comparator to compare the actual value detected by the sensor with a required value input from outside, and an actuator to operate on the system to cause return to the required value in case of deviation.\n2. Control is subject to Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety (Ashby 1956). W. Ross Ashby was a British psychiatrist who first demonstrated the importance of variety in understanding control. The number of possible states of a system is what is defined as the variety of the system. Variety here has a technical systemic meaning which fortunately more or less coincides with its usual meaning. He showed that, in order to achieve sustainable control of a system, the variety of control actions by a controller must be at least equal to the variety of the disturbances which the system could be subject to. This is the Law of Requisite Variety. For example, the state of a motor vehicle travelling along a road is described by its lateral position on the road and its speed along the road, so we need at least control systems to manage these two variables – the person driving is the comparator, and needs the steering mechanism, and the accelerator-brake combination to arrive safely at their destination.\n3. Control is subject to the Conant-Ashby Theorem (Conant & Ashby 1970). The Conant-Ashby Theorem follows from the Law of Requisite Variety and states that the quality of control of a situation depends upon the quality of the model built into the controller. For example, in slippery road conditions the number of potential states of the car system increases: normal driving does not include skids. Understanding how a car behaves in those conditions, having a superior, higher variety model of car behaviour and how to control it, makes for a more skilled and safer driver. If the variety of potential command, i.e. the variety of control actions of the control system, is inadequate, control will not be maintained. Control situations are inherently complex because they involve parts of a system relating to each other in a fractal structure. Relating means communications taking place between the parts\nof a system. The communication channels are two-way feedback structures. Beer, from his practical management experience came to the conclusion that it is the way in which a human organisation relates to its environment and the way in which the parts of any organisation relate to each other that determines how that organisation evolves through time.\n4. A control system is subject to the Suboptimisation Theorem (Katz and Kahn in Systems Thinking, Emory ed.). The Sub-optimisation\nTheorem states that optimisation of a whole system cannot be achieved by separately optimising the parts. In any system there will always be a requirement for restrictions on the freedom of\naction of the sub-units in order to maintain cohesion of the whole. In other words, there must be feedback control loops whose purpose is to restrict the freedom of action of sub-units so that the coherence of the whole system can be maintained."

I therefore propose that a brain\nand nervous system has the ability to review and compare models from different circumstances and extract from that comparison what is common. That new common pattern of recognition and response can then be used to evaluate and react to new experiences that have commonalities of\npattern with the original models. Piaget (1954) describes a number of examples of young children exhibiting multiple models prior to synthesis,\nfor example:\nAt 1 [year]; 3 [months and], (9) [days] Lucienne is in the garden with her mother.\nThen I arrive; she sees me come, smiles at me, therefore obviously recognises me (I\nam at a distance of about 1 metre 50). Her mother then asks her: “Where is papa?”\nCuriously enough, Lucienne immediately turns toward the window of my office\nwhere she is accustomed to seeing me and points in that direction. A moment later\nwe repeat the experiment; she has just seen me 1 metre away from her, yet, when\nher mother pronounces my name, Lucienne again turns toward my office.\nHere it may be clearly seen that ……. I give rise to two distinct behaviour patterns\nnot synthesised……: “papa at his window” and “papa in the garden” (Piaget 1954, 58)\nPiaget describes a process of learning derived from his examples that\naligns with the learning process implied by the modelling I describe here.\nThis second way of increasing the variety of potential command can be en-\nvisaged as the construction of a schema-system from two or more existing\nsystems. The development of a schema-system in this way enables the de-\nvelopment of new sub-systems and the concomitant increase in variety of\npotential command using the first method described above. Being able to\nrecognise a generic pattern is a powerful aid to learning, possibly even the\nroot of creativity – being able to synthesise different experiences to cre-\nate something new (Koestler 1970). To be creative I need to seek different\nexperiences in new circumstances, and new contexts; my brain will take\ncare of the rest.\nThe two learning processes taken together form a simple but pow-\nerful learning mechanism, which increases the range and accuracy of rec-\nognition and response and permits the interpolation of new levels with-\nin existing recognition and response systems. These two learning abilities,\nrecognising difference and recognising similarity, are rather simple to de-\nscribe in these systemic terms. In the first case I am developing the abili-\nty to differentiate between two similar processes where a singular recog-\nnition and response system is refined into two or more sub-systems. In\nthe second case, I identify a schema common to two different recogni-\ntion and response systems and then use that schema to guide reaction to\na new situation. A schema-system once developed from two systems, can\ngive rise to new sub-systems using the first learning process. Both these\npossibilities increase the variety of responses available to environmental\n"

The basic control model of cybernetics is defined as consisting of a system to be controlled; a sensor on the system to detect a variable to be controlled; a comparator to compare the actual value\ndetected by the sensor with a required value input from outside, and an actuator to operate on the system to cause return to the required value in case of deviation.\n2. Control is subject to Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety (Ashby 1956). W. Ross Ashby was a British psychiatrist who first demonstrated the importance of variety in understanding control. The"

        "text": "many past actual occasions coming together to form the one present actual occasion. In Whitehead’s nomenclature the ‘this’ and ‘that’ of ‘subject’\nand ‘object’ now refer to the current actual occasion and the past actual occasions. When the subject actual occasion B prehends an object actu-\nal occasion A, it imposes its perspective. As a result, this process draws from A only the aligned elements of data, and eliminates those elements\nof A which are not aligned to B’s perspective. Whitehead refers to this as the carrying over of feelings from A to B. The use of the word ‘feeling’ extends the usual usage but carries the same meaning e.g. a feeling of anger might be carried forward from one occasion to another. Whitehead’s terms, actual occasion, subject, object, feeling, are evidence of an object-based approach which makes the language and formulation of the ideas at odds with the underlying ideas he wishes to convey. Donald W. Sherburne (1966) describes Whitehead’s approach as an ‘atomistic system’ referring back to the ancient Greek Philosopher Democritus, the originator of the idea of a fundamental particle of matter which is in concept an object. However, the systemic approach developed by Beer, which is the foundation of Beer’s and Checkland’s approach, conceptually aligns with the processes that the modelling is seeking to represent. In this systemic approach the relationships between purposeful systems, the inputs and outputs, are conceptualised as dynamic flows, flows of information and/or of material. Whitehead’s formulation can be related to this systemic process approach by considering snapshots taken at different times corresponding to the ‘actual occasions; the evolution, the ‘prehending’ taking place between snapshots. From a systemic point of view Whitehead’s formulation is an object-based formulation in the traditional scientific way, and secondly Whitehead avoids any hint of teleology as would be expected from in a traditional scientific argument even though clearly processes are teleological (Asby 2021)."

        "text": "Conclusion\nUnderlying my systemic process approach is that ‘out there’ is understood\nas a network of interacting systems that I perceive, but models are devel-\noped to the point that systems can be recognised from multiple perspec-\ntives and now thought of as objects. Thus, there is always an interplay be-\ntween system and object as Aristotle suggests. Systemic process models\nabstracted from specific experiences are the fundamental building blocks\nfrom which object models are constructed. That models are constructed,\neither through lifetime learning, or species learning becomes the central\ntenet of understanding the development of a brain and nervous system.\nThis works well in coping with the world around us, but we then carry\nthis learning into situations in which it does not apply. Both the failure\nof Checkland’s initial attempts at solving complex management problems\nand his subsequent great success with Soft Systems Methodology are ex-\nplained by the understanding that the systemic process approach brings.\nDriven by the enormous success of Western thinking as a foundation\nfor scientific advance, philosophical attempts have been made to explain\nholistic approaches in terms of WEIRD thinking – e.g. Nagel (1961). Nagel\ndefined four types of explanation which he labelled 1) The deductive mod-\nel; 2) probabilistic explanations; 3) functional or teleological explanations;\n4) genetic explanations. Western thinking and, in particular, Western sci-\nentific thinking is based firmly within the first and second of these and has\neither rejected the last two as invalid or, with Nagel, attempts to explain\nthem as derived from the first two. I turn that argument on its head and\nexplain object thinking in terms of systemic process thinking.\nThere are vital differences between systems constructed with differ-\nent purposes in mind, and as Beer (1966) notes, discussions between politi-\ncians with different perspectives find it very difficult to reach agreement.\nFraming the world in terms of objects will result in a rather simplistic\nworld view compared to one built on being aware that in complex situ-\nations a multiplicity of different possibilities exists. Being unaware that\ndifferent starting perspectives assume without recognition different pur-\nposes in constructing a view leads to much misunderstanding. Evolution\nhas equipped Homo sapiens with a more sophisticated brain and nervous\nsystem than other mammals, but it evolved in a context of small hunter\ngatherer tribes. Whilst there were differences in aspects of culture across\nthe world, those differences were seldom encountered, and lifestyles had\nmuch in common. Technology has massively increased our ability to com-\nmunicate across both time and space but also the variety of life experi-\nences. A city banker has little life experience in common with a migrant\nagricultural worker. We assume that a communication once sent will be\nunderstood as we intended. But that is hardly ever the case. In hindsight it\nis not unexpected that the primary and ‘natural’ systemic process way of\nthinking is that practised throughout history and most of the world. And\nalso, as might be expected, the Western way of thinking has arisen as a so-\nphistication which enables flexibility but we pay a price by losing precision\nand losing sight of the dynamic interconnectedness of the world around us.\n"

        "text": "minimising costs will design that hospital rather differently from a doc-\ntor designing that hospital with the purpose of providing the best patient\nexperience. In these two cases the hospital’s relationship to its communi-\nty will not be the same. This is not to suggest that each of these people is\nunable to embrace the other perspective through learning, but that we are\ndependent on the mindset we have in the moment.\nThe important understanding gained is that if I view something\nfor the first time, my eyes receive signals from the scene I observe. My\nbrain singles out a section of that scene because it perceives a bounda-\nry. Light is scattered by something in my visual field which appears as a\ncoherent whole. Light falls on what we term an object, and is scattered\nby that object to my eyes. What I see is a system; light, the input, is scat-\ntered, the process, and my eyes receive the output of the scattering pro-\ncess. Subsequently if I change my perspective to this something I see for\nthe first time, the scattering produces a different image but my brain will\nautomatically synthesise the perceptions from these observations using\nopen learning as described above. I would be developing a schema-system\nfrom the synthesis of the commonalities of my different observations. If\nI go on to take more observations, then all the time I am enhancing my\nschema-system model. As Piaget (1954) describes, this normally happens\nnaturally, early in life, when an infant starts to move about, changing its\nperspective on the world it finds itself in.\nWhen something becomes very familiar from those many observa-\ntions, in the end I forget that each time I view that thing, I do it from a\nparticular position. I make a particular observation from a particular per-\nspective which has a particular relationship to whatever it is that I am ob-\nserving. But it is that single step, the single observation, which is funda-\nmental – my ‘object’ model is built from many such single steps. Once my\nbrain has built that schema-system model, it recognises the object, very\nquickly from the pattern of scattered light reaching my eyes from any ob-\nservational perspective.\nThe use of the word perspective here denotes viewing from a par-\nticular spatial point: the geometric interpretation of the word perspective.\nFor each position I stand in, for each perspective I take, the pattern of re-\nflected light reaching my eyes is different. It is my brain which then over\ntime, using open learning, synthesises these different patterns to form the\nschema-system model. The schema-system model and those many rela-\ntionships are telescoped into no relationship at all in the abstract. But the\nmodel in my head is still a schema-system model ready for use when that\nobject appears in my visual field. The processes of synthesis of different\nperspectives into an object model honed by evolution works well in per-\nceiving and reacting to events in the natural world, but when we come\nto complex situations, for example understanding a functioning hospital,\nwith variety beyond our capacity to span, we are misled by our assump-\ntion of object. We are each limited and encased in our own limited ‘bell\njar’ of experience (Plath 1966). But if we are open to learning, those limits\nexpand as Perry describes.\n"

On the\nother hand, the development of sub-systems to an existing system will\nbe constrained to possibilities of recognition and action already experi-\nenced but now refined. George Lakoff (2008) proposes that ‘conservative\nthought’ is framed in a hierarchy of authority. Anyone is free to act as\nlong as they act within the rules laid down. Clearly, within such a system\nall learning is constrained. Accepting unquestioningly a particular frame\nallows only the possibility of elaborating response sub-systems within that\nframe; constrained learning. Lakoff proposes that ‘progressive thought’ is\nbuilt on caring and empathy together with the responsibility and strength\nto act on that. Having empathy entails not requiring conformance with-\nin a particular frame but being open to learning from others and their\nway of living. Within a framework of protection and empowerment peo-\nple can come together to interact with each other despite their differ-\nences. If they do this they will, through comparing and contrasting their\nown ways of living with other ways of living, learn of the commonalities\nthrough the process of open learning. Further support for this model of\nlearning comes from the work of William Perry (1999) which describes in\ngeneral terms how a mind develops principally using open learning as de-\nscribed above but in some cases only developing to a point beyond which\nembracing the uncertainty implied by the complexity of that person’ en-\nvironment seems overwhelming, and there is a reversion to constrained\nlearning.\nThe Relationship Between the Object Frame\nand the Process Frame\nThe foundation of the systemic process modelling approach defines a\nmodel as a system that produces a particular output from a given input\nin a brain and nervous system. This aligns with the holistic reasoning of\nHenrich et al. (2010):\nHolistic thought involves an orientation to the context or field as a whole, includ-\ning attention to relationships between a focal object and the field, and a prefer-\nence for explaining and predicting events on the basis of such relationships.

These sets of models are not\nnecessarily connected. I suspect we have all experienced meeting some-\none out of their usual context and finding it difficult to identify them.\nRecognising the context we are able to choose response models appropri-\nate to that environmental circumstance. I therefore propose that a brain\nand nervous system has the ability to review and compare models from\ndifferent circumstances and extract from that comparison what is com-\nmon. That new common pattern of recognition and response can then be\nused to evaluate and react to new experiences that have commonalities of\npattern with the original models. Piaget (1954) describes a number of ex-\namples of young children exhibiting multiple models prior to synthesis,\nfor example:\nAt 1 [year]; 3 [months and], (9) [days] Lucienne is in the garden with her mother.\nThen I arrive; she sees me come, smiles at me, therefore obviously recognises me (I\nam at a distance of about 1 metre 50). Her mother then asks her: “Where is papa?”\nCuriously enough, Lucienne immediately turns toward the window of my office\nwhere she is accustomed to seeing me and points in that direction. A moment later\nwe repeat the experiment; she has just seen me 1 metre away from her, yet, when\nher mother pronounces my name, Lucienne again turns toward my office.\nHere it may be clearly seen that ……. I give rise to two distinct behaviour patterns\nnot synthesised……: “papa at his window” and “papa in the garden” (Piaget 1954, 58)\nPiaget describes a process of learning derived from his examples that\naligns with the learning process implied by the modelling I describe here.\nThis second way of increasing the variety of potential command can be en-\nvisaged as the construction of a schema-system from two or more existing\nsystems. The development of a schema-system in this way enables the de-\nvelopment of new sub-systems and the concomitant increase in variety of\npotential command using the first method described above. Being able to\nrecognise a generic pattern is a powerful aid to learning, possibly even the\nroot of creativity – being able to synthesise different experiences to cre-\nate something new (Koestler 1970). To be creative I need to seek different\nexperiences in new circumstances, and new contexts; my brain will take\ncare of the rest.\nThe two learning processes taken together form a simple but pow-\nerful learning mechanism, which increases the range and accuracy of rec-\nognition and response and permits the interpolation of new levels with-\nin existing recognition and response systems. These two learning abilities,\nrecognising difference and recognising similarity, are rather simple to de-\nscribe in these systemic terms. In the first case I am developing the abili-\nty to differentiate between two similar processes where a singular recog-\nnition and response system is refined into two or more sub-systems. In\nthe second case, I identify a schema common to two different recogni-\ntion and response systems and then use that schema to guide reaction to\na new situation. A schema-system once developed from two systems, can\ngive rise to new sub-systems using the first learning process. Both these\npossibilities increase the variety of responses available to environmental\n"

        "text": "The Process Modelling of Learning\nThe brain and nervous system processes incoming signals from the en-\nvironment and produces responses to those incoming signals. William\nJames was one of the first to describe, in a way that is coherent with mod-\nern neuroscience the ability of the brain and nervous system to change,\ndue to both maturation and experience. He also identified the systemic\nfeedback nature of the change process, the basis of learning. This feedback\nloop operates between a living species of animal and its environment: the\nspecies and the environment coevolve. Neuroscientific research has shown\nthat this feedback loop is essential for normal brain development in chil-\ndren (Denes 2016). There are windows in the maturation process of a de-\nveloping child wherein interaction with the environment must take place\nfor normal brain development to progress. Once the window closes, brain\nplasticity reduces and full competence is not achieved.\nThe base unit of the brain and nervous system, the neuron, is a sys-\ntem: it receives inputs from its environment and transforms those inputs\ninto outputs to its environment, just like any other biological cell. A neu-\nron’s purpose is to receive electrical inputs from a variety of other neu-\nrons, and if those inputs reach a threshold level, fire to distribute electri-\ncal output to a variety of other neurons. Neurons can be connected to up\nto 10,000 other neurons and can transmit a signal over a considerable dis-\ntance within the nervous system and brain of an animal. Neurons form a\ncomplex interconnected web of systems, so that the electrical signals flow\nthrough this web of interconnected cells. This is exactly as I require for\nsystemic process modelling. The structure of any neuronal network deter-\nmines the relationship between the inputs to that network and the out-\nputs from that network; models are encoded in the collective action of\nneurons.\nRecognising Difference and Similarity\nI once wanted to increase my ability to name the particular species of the\nsmall birds that I observed. This meant that I would need to refine my\nability for differentiating between species, in what were for me very sim-\nilar experiences. I needed to be able to differentiate between, say, observ-\ning a robin and a sparrow, recognising the various differences in appear-\nance and behaviour. With practice I was able to do that. My model of a\nsmall bird was differentiated into two separate models one each for the\nrobin and the sparrow. In any situation where control is necessary, devel-\noping an ability to differentiate between similar situations, in this way,\nincreases the variety of control responses exactly as required by Ashby’s\nLaw. Thus being able to differentiate out two or more response sub-sys-\ntems from an existing response system is perhaps the simplest way to ex-\ntend response patterns to increase variety of potential command.\nThe second way of extending possible response patterns is to devel-\nop the ability to respond to new challenges - those that have never been\nmet before. A living entity in a changing environment will naturally need\nto modify its responses as its environment changes, but will also need to\ncope with challenges that it has not encountered before. This second abil-\nity is a more powerful way of increasing the variety of possible control\n"

        "text": "number of possible states of a system is what is defined as the\nvariety of the system. Variety here has a technical systemic\nmeaning which fortunately more or less coincides with its usual\nmeaning. He showed that, in order to achieve sustainable con-\ntrol of a system, the variety of control actions by a controller\nmust be at least equal to the variety of the disturbances which\nthe system could be subject to. This is the Law of Requisite\nVariety. For example, the state of a motor vehicle travelling\nalong a road is described by its lateral position on the road and\nits speed along the road, so we need at least control systems to\nmanage these two variables – the person driving is the com-\nparator, and needs the steering mechanism, and the accelera-\ntor-brake combination to arrive safely at their destination.\n3. Control is subject to the Conant-Ashby Theorem (Conant &\nAshby 1970). The Conant-Ashby Theorem follows from the Law\nof Requisite Variety and states that the quality of control of a\nsituation depends upon the quality of the model built into the\ncontroller. For example, in slippery road conditions the num-\nber of potential states of the car system increases: normal driv-\ning does not include skids. Understanding how a car behaves in\nthose conditions, having a superior, higher variety model of car\nbehaviour and how to control it, makes for a more skilled and\nsafer driver. If the variety of potential command, i.e. the vari-\nety of control actions of the control system, is inadequate, con-\ntrol will not be maintained.\nControl situations are inherently complex because they involve\nparts of a system relating to each other in a fractal structure.\nRelating means communications taking place between the parts\nof a system. The communication channels are two-way fee-\ndback structures. Beer, from his practical management experi-\nence came to the conclusion that it is the way in which a human\norganisation relates to its environment and the way in which\nthe parts of any organisation relate to each other that deter-\nmines how that organisation evolves through time.\n4. A control system is subject to the Suboptimisation Theorem (Katz\nand Kahn in Systems Thinking, Emory ed.). The Sub-optimisation\nTheorem states that optimisation of a whole system cannot be\nachieved by separately optimising the parts. In any system there\nwill always be a requirement for restrictions on the freedom of\naction of the sub-units in order to maintain cohesion of the whole.\nIn other words, there must be feedback control loops whose pur-\npose is to restrict the freedom of action of sub-units so that the\ncoherence of the whole system can be maintained.\nThe fractal nature of an organisational structure requires that\ncontrol systems populate the model in the same fractal way. It\nis from these underlying ideas that Beer developed his Viable\nSystem Model as a model of what is necessary and sufficient\nfor a human organisation to be capable of adapting to a chang-\ning environment. (Asby 2021) has extended the VSM approach\nto model how animals act, react, and adapt to a changing\nenvironment.\n"

        "text": "many past actual occasions coming together to form the one present actu-\nal occasion. In Whitehead’s nomenclature the ‘this’ and ‘that’ of ‘subject’\nand ‘object’ now refer to the current actual occasion and the past actual\noccasions. When the subject actual occasion B prehends an object actu-\nal occasion A, it imposes its perspective. As a result, this process draws\nfrom A only the aligned elements of data, and eliminates those elements\nof A which are not aligned to B’s perspective. Whitehead refers to this\nas the carrying over of feelings from A to B. The use of the word ‘feeling’\nextends the usual usage but carries the same meaning e.g. a feeling of an-\nger might be carried forward from one occasion to another. Whitehead’s\nterms, actual occasion, subject, object, feeling, are evidence of an ob-\nject-based approach which makes the language and formulation of the\nideas at odds with the underlying ideas he wishes to convey. Donald W.\nSherburne (1966) describes Whitehead’s approach as an ‘atomistic system’\nreferring back to the ancient Greek Philosopher Democritus, the origina-\ntor of the idea of a fundamental particle of matter which is in concept an\nobject. However, the systemic approach developed by Beer, which is the\nfoundation of Beer’s and Checkland’s approach, conceptually aligns with\nthe processes that the modelling is seeking to represent. In this systemic\napproach the relationships between purposeful systems, the inputs and\noutputs, are conceptualised as dynamic flows, flows of information and/\nor of material. Whitehead’s formulation can be related to this systemic\nprocess approach by considering snapshots taken at different times corre-\nsponding to the ‘actual occasions; the evolution, the ‘prehending’ taking\nplace between snapshots. From a systemic point of view Whitehead’s for-\nmulation is an object-based formulation in the traditional scientific way,\nand secondly Whitehead avoids any hint of teleology as would be expect-\ned from in a traditional scientific argument even though clearly processes\nare teleological (Asby 2021).\nThe Additional Cybernetic Frame\nHolding steady in a changing environment is achieved in all circum-\nstances through exemplifications of the basic control model. In the late\n1940s and early 1950s it was recognised that the mathematical modelling\nof control systems in different disciplines had produced the same under-\nstanding, and a series of conferences, the Macy Conferences (Foerster\neditor 1951) were held to explore these issues. It was recognised that the\ncontrol model is a schema system which can be recognised in all such sit-\nuations. For a cybernetic frame I therefore add the following precepts\nto those above.\n1. The basic control model of cybernetics is defined as consisting of\na system to be controlled; a sensor on the system to detect a var-\niable to be controlled; a comparator to compare the actual value\ndetected by the sensor with a required value input from out-\nside, and an actuator to operate on the system to cause return\nto the required value in case of deviation.\n2. Control is subject to Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety (Ashby\n1956). W. Ross Ashby was a British psychiatrist who first demon-\nstrated the importance of variety in understanding control. The\n"

        "text": "The Basic Systemic Process Thinking Frame\nThe frame within which systemic process models are constructed involves\nthe following precepts:\n1. Models are constructed from a particular perspective, that of\nthe observer/definer of the model. Models are therefore always\nsubjective.\n2. The purpose of a system process model is defined by the rela-\ntionship of the process to its environment as defined by the\nobserver/ definer.\n3. Systems can be analysed into subsystems, and further, can be\nenvisaged as a subunit of a super-system. Hence system pro-\ncess models are inherently fractal in nature reflecting the frac-\ntal nature of natural ecological systems. The idea that modelling,\nstarting from a systemic process base, necessarily leads to a frac-\ntal structure was first developed by Beer in his series of books\ndeveloping the Viable System Model (VSM). This necessary lay-\nered or fractal structure of any organisation achieving viability\ncame from a synthesis of logic in the management of an organ-\nisation and the structure of the human nervous system (Beer\n1972; 1979; 1985).\n4. Systems form an interconnected network of processes.\n5. Systems can also be considered a subunit of a schema-system.\nCommonalities of purpose can be recognised across different\nexemplifications of a system type. For example, Plato’s ideal bed\n(Plato, trans. by Lee, 1987, 362) is such a schema-system because\na bed can be recognised across different exemplifications of the\nsame relationship situation, due to their common purpose. For\nexample, a straw mat, or four poster bed, and other objects in\nthe same relationship situation which all share the purpose – to\nprovide a place to sleep. In the same way Beer’s Viable System\nModel is proposed as such a schema system for a viable human\norganisation in that any viable human organisation will exhibit\nthat basic underlying organisational pattern.\nWhitehead’s Process Philosophy\nThe focus on process as the centre of the systemic process definition in-\nput → process → output, and the systemic process models being intercon-\nnected networks of processes, brings the concept of process to the fore.\nThe most important contributor to an understanding of process and its as-\nsociated philosophy was Alfred North Whitehead (Whitehead 1978). The\nfirst publication of Process and Reality in 1929 preceded the development\nof Systems Thinking. Whitehead’s formulation of his Process Philosophy\nrelates directly to the systemic process formulation (Asby 2021, 134).\nWhitehead’s central idea is an ‘actual occasion’, that is a situation point in\ntime where a person perceives the need to respond. In Whitehead’s for-\nmulation an ‘actual occasion’ comes into being by drawing on, in his lan-\nguage ‘prehending’ past actual occasions in a process of ‘concrescence’; the"

I interpret what James means by “world formula” as the set of mental models in use at any one time, and “true one” as the viable model in the sense defined by Von Glasersfeld. Hence, I conclude that with the foundation of Pragmatism, originating with Peirce, through to von Glasersfeld’s Radical Constructivism there is a coherent logical foundation for systemic process thinking, which replaces the reliance on ‘reality’ in the underpinning of WEIRD thinking. Importantly within this way of thinking about thinking it must be remembered that each individual is unique and understands the world in a unique way.

He found that standard techniques failed and as a result developed the approach which he called Soft Systems Methodology (SSM). This approach takes the key step into the teleological process world by setting a _Root Definition_ as the starting point for building a systemic model which is a process model.

Thus the model to be constructed has the form of a purposeful input (from the process environment) -> process -> output (to the process environment) structure. I will use the word 'purpose' rather than Root Definition to define this co-evolutionary relationship between a system and its environment following Beer (Beer 1979; 1985). However, it should be noted that in common usage the word 'purpose' does not generally mean the whole of the relationship of the system to its environment but usually relates only to one major output of the system concerned. For example, the purpose of a nuclear power plant is usually thought of as the production of electricity, one output, but with no reference to waste\nwhich we still cannot safely deal with, another output, nor indeed any reference to the necessary inputs."

However, in the late 1970's and early 1980's two authors, Peter Checkland and Stafford Beer, framed\ntheir work differently."

These two authors frame their approach in a [[transformation process]], the purpose of which lies in the eye of the beholder/[[observer]] defining the process, and characterised by its relationship to its [[context]]. I start from the Heraclitian notion that in the world in which we find ourselves **all is flux and change**. Using the frame developed by Beer and Checkland, I propose that this process view is fundamental to developing models and understanding of the [[stability]] we find in phenomena in our world. I explore the necessary structures to achieve [[coherence]] and [[adaptability]] and show that the [[learning process]] is essential. I designate this approach **'systemic process thinking'**, and show that it can be considered a distinct paradigm which fits the Heraclitian view of **a dynamic world**. lt is necessarily [[constructivist]], improves on **Whitehead's Process Philosophy**, and has considerable modelling power. I also show how the Western WEIRD approach has been derived from this."

For example, when exploring maps in an atlas, you will know to be careful in the way in which you interpret a map of the world. To map the world, the spherical earth must be flattened so that it may be drawn on a page. The two dimensional framing putting the map on a page inevitably distorts the relationships between different parts of the territory making calculations of distances problematic. Using coordinates appropriate to a flat page to describe geometric shapes on the curved surface of a sphere can be done, but leads to complexity and difficulties in understanding. Whereas putting the map on a globe and using latitude and longitude or spherical coordinates as the basis for the modelling makes the distance calculations as simple as possible. The **shared [[Symmetry]]**, between the frame chosen and the [[Situation]] being modelled simplifies the understanding and the calculations. In many situations under scrutiny symmetry between the [[Base Frame]] and the situation under investigation plays a guiding role in choosing an appropriate modelling basis."

The developments in the 17th century in science and philosophy established the dominance of this approach (Deely 2001, Diamond zor:).

The belief in this 'real world' gave rise to the idea of knowledge detached and independent of the knower. Thus 'objective' has in common usage come to be an adjective in the description of a situation, or reportage which carries the meaning that this is the 'correct' or 'real' view that all should believe, independent of any particular observer. As a result of the success of the WEIRD approach originally in physics, other disciplines, including biology, psychology and economics, also adopted this worldview. From there this worldview became dominant in the Western world (Deely 2001). WEIRD thinking is an approach that informs us directly of things and their attributes, assumed to be a description of the thing as it is, rather than what we would perceive in the particular circumstances in which we were looking. WEIRD thinking does account for the geometrical sense of [[perspective]] perfectly adequately in that we understand that objects that have [[Spatial]] extent can appear in various forms due to distance or their 3-dimensional shape, but there is much more to the concept of perspective as I will describe."

The purposeful rationale of Aristotle's house perhaps can be better described in the form of a **process which transforms a constantly changing variable** environment on the outside to a calm interior conducive to comfortable living. Unfortunately, most of Heraclitus' writing is lost but we do know from the references that have survived that the writing of Heraclitus (c540-480BCE) (Khan 1979) was considered very important in his own and later times. His underpinning philosophy has been interpreted as **'all is flux and change'**. We must note that whilst the environments of all living forms change, living forms survive and through their lifetimes remain identifiably themselves. However, after the ancient Greek philosophers it wasn't until the 1878 publication of Claude Bernard's _Les Phenomdnes de la Vie_ that it was noted that that it was remarkable that in a world of constant change the **internal environment of animals remained constant**. Walter Canon in his 1932 book _The Wisdom of the Body_ coined the term '[[homeostasis]]' for this phenomenon. In an environment of flux and change the question that needs to be answered then is: - how is this stability achieved? The answer to this question lies in the science of _[[cybernetics]]_ defined by Norbert Wiener as \"the science of control in the animal and the machine\" (Wiener 1948). The science of cybernetics gave rise to the more general discipline of Systems Thinking, but in the beginning it all remained within the extant WEIRD paradigm. However, in the late 1970's and early 1980's two authors, Peter Checkland and Stafford Beer, framed their work differently."

He found that standard techniques failed and as a result developed the approach which he called [[Soft Systems Methodology]] (SSM). This approach takes the key step into the teleological process world by setting a _[[Root Definition]]_ as the starting point for building a systemic model which is a [[Process Model]]. The Root Definition defines the **relationship between the model to be constructed using the systemic frame and the environment of this process**. Thus the model to be constructed has the form of a [[Purposeful Input]] (from the process environment) -> [[Process]] -> [[Output]] (to the process environment) structure. I will use the word 'purpose' rather than Root Definition to define this **co-evolutionary relationship between a system and its environment** following Beer (Beer 1979; 1985). However, it should be noted that in common usage the word 'purpose' does not generally mean the whole of the relationship of the system to its environment but usually relates **only to one major output** of the system concerned. For example, the purpose of a nuclear power plant is usually thought of as the production of electricity, one output, but with no reference to [[Waste]] which we still cannot safely deal with, another output, nor indeed any reference to the necessary inputs."

I interpret what James means by “[[World Formula]]” as the set of mental models in use at any one time, and “true one” as the viable model in the sense defined by Von Glasersfeld. Hence, I conclude that with the foundation of Pragmatism, originating with Peirce, through to von Glasersfeld’s Radical Constructivism there is a coherent logical **foundation for systemic process thinking**, which replaces the reliance on ‘reality’ in the underpinning of WEIRD thinking. Importantly within this way of thinking about thinking it must be remembered that each individual is unique and understands the world in a unique way. They have a unique perspective on any situation the evidence for which comes from Checkland’s experience of the failure of the WEIRD approach in complex management situations."

The most important contributor to an understanding of process and its associated philosophy was [[Alfred North Whitehead]] (Whitehead 1978). The first publication of [[Process and Reality]] in 1929 preceded the development of Systems Thinking. Whitehead’s formulation of his [[Process Philosophy]] relates directly to the systemic process formulation (Asby 2021, 134). Whitehead’s central idea is an ‘actual occasion’, that is a situation point in time where a person perceives the need to respond. In Whitehead’s formulation an ‘actual occasion’ comes into being by drawing on, in his language ‘[[Prehending]]’ past actual occasions in a process of ‘[[Concrescence]]’; the many past actual occasions coming together to form the one present actual occasion. In Whitehead’s nomenclature the ‘this’ and ‘that’ of ‘subject’ and ‘object’ now refer to the [[Current]] actual occasion and the [[Past]] actual occasions. When the subject actual occasion B prehends an object actual occasion A, it imposes its perspective. As a result, this process draws from A only the aligned elements of data, and eliminates those elements of A which are not aligned to B’s perspective. Whitehead refers to this as the carrying over of [[Feelings]] from A to B. The use of the word ‘feeling’ extends the usual usage but carries the same meaning e.g. a **feeling of anger** might be carried forward from one occasion to another. Whitehead’s terms, actual occasion, subject, object, feeling, are evidence of an object-based approach which makes the language and formulation of the ideas at odds with the underlying ideas he wishes to convey. [[Donald W. Sherburne]] (1966) describes Whitehead’s approach as an ‘[[Atomistic System]]’ referring back to the ancient Greek Philosopher Democritus, the originator of the idea of a fundamental particle of matter which is in concept an object. However, the systemic approach developed by Beer, which is the foundation of Beer’s and Checkland’s approach, conceptually aligns with the processes that the modelling is seeking to represent. In this systemic approach the relationships between purposeful systems, the inputs and outputs, are conceptualised as [[Dynamic Flows]], flows of information and/or of material. Whitehead’s formulation can be related to this systemic process approach by considering snapshots taken at different times corresponding to the ‘actual occasions; the evolution, the ‘prehending’ taking place between snapshots. From a systemic point of view **Whitehead’s formulation is an object-based formulation** in the traditional scientific way, and secondly **Whitehead avoids any hint of teleology** as would be expected from in a traditional scientific argument even though clearly processes are teleological (Asby 2021)."

Variety here has a technical systemic meaning which fortunately more or less coincides with its usual meaning. He showed that, in order to achieve sustainable control of a system, **the variety of control actions by a controller must be at least equal to the variety of the disturbances which the system could be subject to.** This is the [[Law of Requisite Variety]]. For example, the state of a motor vehicle traveling along a road is described by its lateral position on the road and its speed along the road, so we need at least control systems to manage these two variables – the person driving is the comparator, and needs the steering mechanism, and the accelerator-brake combination to arrive safely at their destination."

        "text": "The second way of extending possible response patterns is to develop the **ability to respond to new challenges** - those that have never been met before. A living entity in a changing environment will naturally need to modify its responses as its environment changes, but will also need to cope with challenges that it has not encountered before. This second ability is **a more powerful way of increasing the variety of possible control** responses, and significantly increasing the variety of potential command. At any one time a brain and nervous system will contain sets of mental models for use in different situations. These **sets of models** are not necessarily connected. I suspect we have all experienced meeting someone out of their usual context and finding it difficult to identify them. **Recognising the context** we are able to **choose response models appropriate** to that environmental circumstance. I therefore propose that a brain and nervous system has the ability to review and compare models from different circumstances and extract from that comparison what is common. That new common pattern of recognition and response can then be used to evaluate and react to new experiences that have commonalities of pattern with the original models. Piaget (1954) describes a number of examples of young children exhibiting **multiple models prior to [[Synthesis]]**, for example:"

The development of a schema-system in this way enables the development of new sub-systems and the concomitant increase in variety of potential command using the first method described above. Being able to recognise a **[[Generic Pattern]]** is a powerful aid to learning, possibly even the [[Root of Creativity]] – being able to [[Synthesise]] different experiences to create something new (Koestler 1970). To be creative I need to seek **different [[Experiences]] in new [[Circumstances]], and new contexts**; my brain will take care of the rest."

These **two learning abilities**, recognising [[difference]] and recognising [[Similarity]], are rather simple to describe in these systemic terms. In the first case I am developing the **ability to differentiate between two similar processes** where a singular recognition and response system is refined into two or more sub-systems. In the second case, I **identify a schema common to two different recognition and response systems** and then use that schema to guide reaction to a new situation. A [[schema-system]] once developed from two systems, can give rise to new sub-systems using the first learning process. Both these possibilities increase the variety of responses available to environmental disturbance and therefore according to the Law of Requisite Variety increase the chance of survival. _(Create an arrows diagram with Robin Asby to illustrate these relationships, this system of learning.)_"

The schema-system model and those many relationships are telescoped into no relationship at all in the abstract. But the model in my head is still a **schema-system model ready for use when that object appears** in my visual field. The processes of synthesis of different perspectives into an object model honed by evolution works well in perceiving and reacting to events in the natural world, but when we come to complex situations, for example understanding a functioning hospital, with **variety beyond our capacity to span**, we are **misled by our [[Assumption of Object]]**. We are each limited and encased in our own limited **‘bell jar’ of experience** (Plath 1966). But if we are open to learning, those limits expand as Perry describes."

        "text": "Congruence between frame and the territory I perceive simplifies model building and gives much better **[[insight]] and [[understanding]]**. For example, when exploring maps in an atlas, you will know to be careful in the way in which you interpret a map of the world. To map the world, the spherical earth must be flattened so that it may be drawn on a page. The two dimensional framing putting the map on a page inevitably distorts the relationships between different parts of the territory making calculations of distances problematic. Using coordinates appropriate to a flat page to describe geometric shapes on the curved surface of a sphere can be done, but leads to complexity and difficulties in understanding. Whereas putting the map on a globe and using latitude and longitude or spherical coordinates as the basis for the modelling makes the distance calculations as simple as possible. The **shared [[Symmetry]]**, between the frame chosen and the [[Situation]] being modelled simplifies the understanding and the calculations. In many situations under scrutiny symmetry between the [[Base Frame]] and the situation under investigation plays a guiding role in choosing an appropriate modelling basis."
