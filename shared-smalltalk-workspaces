The keys in the URLs are random and hard to guess, so unless someone knows the URL/key they won't be able to access the workspace. We promise not to further share workspaces by publishing indexes or making their contents searcheable. This service is currently in beta. Workspaces are not guaranteed to be persistent, although every effort is made to offer a good service.\n\nWhen serving a workspace's contents, the Accept HTTP header will normally determine the resulting response's content. Browser HTTP agents that normally indicate that they prefer HTML content will receive a full, decorated HTML page. Non-browser HTTP agents will receive plain, undecorated text content. A custom Accept header can be used to control the response. Additionally, adding a query parameter format=html or format=text to the URL will override this behavior.\n\nOnce created, shared workspaces are read-only. They can neither be modified, nor deleted. Little used workspaces will eventually be removed after some period of time. The maximum size for workspaces is limited to 2Kb. Any line end convention as well as ASCII, Latin1 and UTF-8 encoding are supported for incoming data. Workspaces are always served using the Unix line end convention and UTF-8 encoding.\n\n"
