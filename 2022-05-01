Complex systems are understood as embodied predictors of their environment (Friston, 2010), a process contingent on iterative exchange. This predictive shift, operationalised in a mathematical framework ([[Active Inference]]), allows a multiscale approach to describing the necessary contingencies for resilient systems, from the microbiome to the metropolis. Extended from evolutionary biology, a healthy system is one that is trained on uncertainty (Friston, 2010), enabling it to predict the consequences of this dynamic coupling, accommodate perturbations (resilience) and update its predictions over time (adaptive capacity).\n\nFirst, we will present an early translation of this mathematical modelling approach, describing the relationship between biodiversity, immune markers and health outcomes from an existing, cohort dataset (ALSPAC, Bristol, UK).\n\nSecond, we will demonstrate how to embed this descriptive mathematical model of resilience in a prototype Pattern, as part of a broader network of patterns within A New Pattern Language (Mehaffy, 2020) for resilience in the city. We will present the basis for iterative, mathematically informed, data trained hypotheses for resilience, starting at the human level."

        "text": "A paradigm shift has taken place over the last decade across the biological sciences. Complex systems are understood as embodied predictors of their environment (Friston, 2010), a process contingent on iterative exchange. This predictive shift, operationalised in a mathematical framework ([[Active Inference]]), allows a multiscale approach to describing the necessary contingencies for resilient systems, from the microbiome to the metropolis. Extended from evolutionary biology, a healthy system is one that is trained on uncertainty (Friston, 2010), enabling it to predict the consequences of this dynamic coupling, accommodate perturbations (resilience) and update its predictions over time (adaptive capacity).\n\nFirst, we will present an early translation of this mathematical modelling approach, describing the relationship between biodiversity, immune markers and health outcomes from an existing, cohort dataset (ALSPAC, Bristol, UK).\n\nSecond, we will demonstrate how to embed this descriptive mathematical model of resilience in a prototype Pattern, as part of a broader network of patterns within A New Pattern Language (Mehaffy, 2020) for resilience in the city. We will present the basis for iterative, mathematically informed, data trained hypotheses for resilience, starting at the human level."
