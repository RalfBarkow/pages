This skillful gaming advanced careers and perceived corporate compliance, adhering to the educational rhetoric of the day, and being small 'p' political players within the system, can bring with it 'success'. These old power values help maintain the status quo. We do need to move past the drive to find efficiencies to unleash the creative genius of all concerned for the future."
