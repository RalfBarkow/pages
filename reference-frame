        "text": "The multicomputational paradigm is something that’s emerging from our Physics Project, and from thinking about fundamental physics. But one of the most powerful things about having a general paradigm for theoretical science is that it implies a certain unity across different areas of science—and by providing a common framework it allows results and intuitions developed in one area to be transferred to others."
