However, the ideas of the British cybernetician are present throughout the text. For example, the book repeats Beer's approach to problem solving, which is \"not so much to solve them [problems] as to dissolve them.\" Like Beer, the authors view computers as tools that can support decision making and drive action. They call for a holistic view of complexity that positions computer technology as one part of a complex system consisting of organizational, social, and technological practices. And they do not shy away from synthesizing literature and findings from computing, philosophy, biology, and neurophysiology. I point to these parallels not to say that Beer was the sole originator of these ideas, for he clearly was not. Nor am I suggesting that Winograd and Flores usurped Beer's ideas without proper credit. Rather, I point to these commonalities to show that Beer and cybernetics had more of a lasting effect on Flores's thinking than is apparent from the citations and bibliography of Understanding Computers and Cognition.\nFlores also spent the 1980s reinventing himself as a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. He started Logonet, an educational consulting firm, to teach ontological design to the business community. With Winograd he formed a start-up company, Action Technologies, and developed a software package called the Coordinator Workgroup Productivity System, which they billed as the first work-group system for computer networks.
