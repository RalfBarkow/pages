Therefore, he must first characterize this factual field itself – in its two-tiered nature of plant and animal. In meta-linguistic terms this means: Plessner prepares his statements on philosophical anthropology by outlining a \"philosophical biology\". In this, too, Plessner puts the concept of thing in the foreground and seems to want to compensate linguistically for a certain proximity to vitalism. Constantly the general concept of thing is foisted on living beings, there is talk of \"living things\", or also of \"body things\" or \"thing bodies\" – which must possess a certain peculiarity so that they can be called living beings. Living bodies are those, with which \"the aspect divergence, which was shown as precondition of every thing-body appearing unity\", also [[appear]]s – and is not only obvious to the philosophical consideration."

He assigns the philosophical treatment of this subject field to his earlier writing Die Einheit der Sinne. Grundlinien einer Ästhesiologie der Sinne (The Unity of the Senses), in which he had formulated the qualitative parameters of human perception: colorfulness, extension, resonance, and state. He only mentions thingness insofar as he claims that it is reserved for the ray of sight to grasp the \"graspability\" of the thing. This formulation at least suggests that the sense of touch also has something to say about thingness."

Does he already consider the thingly as the whole of the appearing or the physical? Since for a thing its limitation is essential and the different relations of things to their limitations set crucial distinctions within the world of things, Plessner must also name the outside of the thing or the body. He does this with the term [[Medium]], which since ancient times in physics has denoted the outside and the surrounding and more specifically the what in of a body. Already with the use and the juxtaposition of the two terms body and medium Plessner makes clear that his doctrine of things, although it seems to start perceptual-psychologically, actually reaches over to the ground of physics. For in the explanations and drawings of the different relations between body and medium, medium is hardly understood functionally, but predominantly purely topologically: as environment or milieu (medius locus)."

      "text": "Here Plessner concentrates on the differentiation of boundary behaviors and not on the qualitative determination of what exactly is meant by medium: adjacent bodies or physical realities of a non-thing-like kind? Occasionally there is talk of \"other bodies\", then again of \"subsistence means, nutrients, light, heat, water, gases, and other living beings\". Under the term medium, therefore, obviously other bodies, even of relatively equal rank, as well as physical realities, to which one would hardly want to ascribe a thing-like corporeality, fall. So the term is not a qualitative counter-term to that of the body. Rather it designates topically an \"environment\", a \"counter-field\" and then also vaguely a medium, i.e. a supporting field, for the body meant in each case, especially the living body. Medium is any material outside to which a body borders and to which it can or must relate in different ways, whereby the quality and role of the border also vary: Plessner outlines several forms of body-medium or body-boundary-medium relations. Among them also those typical for living beings, in which the subsistence of a body is diverted via a medium – or as one just says: \"mediated\". Already in plants and animals the inside-outside relation fractalizes to an inside-inside split, in that the organs of the body have to mediate between the body and the medium."

The thing we call man (and which we are) conducts its existence by means of other things. The \"reification\" of anthropology asserts itself in Plessner on both the \"metaphorical\" and the \"metonymic\" lines. On the metonymic line, such things crystallize out of the environmental medium that can be subsumed under the functional and instrumental concept of media common today. In this meaning, the hand becomes the \"first\" more or less material medium, an accrued medium thing that mediates between us \"ourselves\" and the other, even more distant things."

Simultaneously with Plessner's early work on aesthesiology and philosophical anthropology (which also includes the limits of community, not yet mentioned), the Austrian philosopher and psychologist Fritz Heider (1896-1988), who came from the Meinong School in Graz, dealt with problems of the psychology of perception. In his dissertation Zur Subjektivität der Sinnesqualitäten (On the Subjectivity of Sense Qualities) he adopted from Mally the concept of the law of appearance and from Meinong the concept of perceptual forums. These divide into an inner forum, which is bisected into the psycho-physical and the physiological, and an outer forum, which corresponds to the medium. He means such media, which already Aristotle described as such, namely as perception media (e.g. air, light). However, he emphasizes that these media, although they causally contribute to the perceptual event, fall out of perception. As a rule, there is a perceptual discrimination of the perceptual media against the objects of perception, i.e. the things, and Heider asks the question whether this half-concealed, half-obvious difference between the things and the media is caused by their physical constitution."

He answered it thus: Realities that are \"soft,\" \"many-coupled,\" or \"loosely coupled\" and therefore take over and transmit the effects of \"hard,\" \"uniform,\" or \"tightly coupled\" realities are suitable as media. The smaller the loosely coupled elements of the media are, the more faithfully and exactly they can take over the influences of the firmly coupled things; then \"every single impact is a special messenger, which announces a new side, property, a new moment of the cause. And the more independent it is of its neighbors, the other messengers, the more unclouded, undisturbed it carries the message.\""

However, the script also works when it consists of only two letters, as Heider states with the example of Morse script [⇒ [[Morse Code]]]. But then the separation of the two letters and the \"freedom\" of their succession is all the more important. For the reader, the letters have a similar function as the light waves have for the seer. For the scribe, on the other hand, they are the medium of a motor intervention in the world-and in a certain sense, for the scribe, they are not black figures on a white background, but expressed meaning made into an \"outside world thing.\" In Heider, then, a similar language of reification as in Plessner, who appointed knowledge an in-between thing."

It, too, has inspired the author of these lines to attempt a physics of media in consistent elaboration, in which, by the way, he has named the authors Aristotle of Stageira and Fritz Heider, who are far apart in time, \"classics of media physics.\" Critically, the physics of media turns against the thesis that with the so-called new media a great dematerialization movement has begun – a thesis that overlooks the fact that media have always worked with miniaturization or/and with atomization, which, however, have also put new bodies into the world. With this critique, which could also hit an exaggerated \"ontological\" mathematicism (of Pythagorean or modern character), she moves in the footsteps of Plessner, who, as already mentioned, in his earliest writings wanted to prove to contemporary art tendencies that they directly chase the purely immaterial in vain. The fact that immateriality can only or best be achieved by working with materialities is particularly evident in the large-body phenomenon of architecture, as Heike Delitz emphasizes in recent works.

      "text": "The concept of media commonly used today is the functionally determined one: human actions, which mostly proceed from desires, transmissions, messages, which address addressees, need \"third\" interposed elements for their execution, which are at the same time necessary means, detours and possible disturbing factors – and these are called \"media\". This action-theoretical, anthropological, if one wants also \"existential\" meaning of media forms a central point in Plessner's Philosophical Anthropology. It is introduced in 1924 in the socio-philosophical essay Grenzen der Gemeinschaft (Limits of Community), where the \"intermediate layer\" of masks and machines, of ceremonial, artificiality and the \"medium\" is shown to be necessary for society to come into being. For action, for being human itself, this results in a high degree of \"indirectness\". In the main work of philosophical anthropology, in the stages of the organic already referred to here, this indirectness – however in close connection with the opposite directness – is declared to be the second anthropological basic law: \"law of mediated immediacy\". And in this context, the concept of \"medium\", which had been introduced before on a more topical-physical level as a counter-concept to the bodily thing, is thematized again – in its functional, but apparently also possibly counter-functional relevance. Plessner assumes \"that man must realize his drives and plans in an idiosyncratic medium,\" that the \"rays of his intention [...] meet the real medium directly\" and suffer \"a [...] deflection there.\" Plessner thus introduces the modern media problem in this way in 1928 and already hints at the ambivalence associated with it, which also triggers the so-called media critique."

He sees this feature in the fact that a living thing not only has [[Boundaries]] (from wherever), but actively sets its boundaries: builds them up and [[cross]]es them – and in this paradoxical boundary behavior differentiates an [[Inside]] and an [[Outside]] more clearly than a thing otherwise does."

The thing we call man (and which we are) conducts its existence by means of other things. The \"reification\" of anthropology asserts itself in Plessner on both the \"metaphorical\" and the \"metonymic\" lines. On the metonymic line, such things crystallize out of the environmental medium that can be subsumed under the functional and instrumental concept of media common today. In this meaning, the hand becomes the \"first\" more or less material medium, an accrued medium thing that mediates between us \"ourselves\" and the other, even more distant things."

Simultaneously with Plessner's early work on aesthesiology and philosophical anthropology (which also includes the limits of community, not yet mentioned), the Austrian philosopher and psychologist Fritz Heider (1896-1988), who came from the Meinong School in Graz, dealt with problems of the psychology of perception. In his dissertation Zur Subjektivität der Sinnesqualitäten (On the Subjectivity of Sense Qualities) he adopted from Mally the concept of the law of appearance and from Meinong the concept of perceptual forums. These divide into an inner forum, which is bisected into the psycho-physical and the physiological, and an outer forum, which corresponds to the medium. He means such media, which already Aristotle described as such, namely as perception media (e.g. air, light). However, he emphasizes that these media, although they causally contribute to the perceptual event, fall out of perception. As a rule, there is a perceptual discrimination of the perceptual media against the objects of perception, i.e. the things, and Heider asks the question whether this half-concealed, half-obvious difference between the things and the media is caused by their physical constitution."

In it he took up the question just mentioned, whether something that serves as a mediation of cognition is \"purely physically\" different from an object of cognition.  He answered it thus: Realities that are \"soft,\" \"many-coupled,\" or \"loosely coupled\" and therefore take over and transmit the effects of \"hard,\" \"uniform,\" or \"tightly coupled\" realities are suitable as media. The smaller the loosely coupled elements of the media are, the more faithfully and exactly they can take over the influences of the firmly coupled things; then \"every single impact is a special messenger, which announces a new side, property, a new moment of the cause. And the more independent it is of its neighbors, the other messengers, the more unclouded, undisturbed it carries the message.\""

        "text": "As [[Joachim Fischer]] points out, Plessner is concerned with determining what is typically human \"from below\" [⇒ [[Above and Below the Line]]], by demonstrating vivid peculiarities within the factual field of the living. Therefore, he must first characterize this factual field itself – in its two-tiered nature of plant and animal. In meta-linguistic terms this means: Plessner prepares his statements on philosophical anthropology by outlining a \"philosophical biology\". In this, too, Plessner puts the concept of thing in the foreground and seems to want to compensate linguistically for a certain proximity to vitalism. Constantly the general concept of thing is foisted on living beings, there is talk of \"living things\", or also of \"body things\" or \"thing bodies\" – which must possess a certain peculiarity so that they can be called living beings. Living bodies are those, with which \"the aspect divergence, which was shown as precondition of every thing-body appearing unity\", also [[appear]]s – and is not only obvious to the philosophical consideration."

        "text": "Plessner does not invent new essential vital performances ([[Growth]], [[Reproduction]], etc.), but he searches for a vivid overall characteristic that distinguishes living things from others. He sees this feature in the fact that a living thing not only has [[Boundaries]] (from wherever), but actively sets its boundaries: builds them up and [[cross]]es them – and in this paradoxical boundary behavior differentiates an [[Inside]] and an [[Outside]] more clearly than a thing otherwise does."

In the philosophical physics, which Plessner actually precedes his philosophical biology, he restricts himself to the presentation of the descriptive constitution of the thing as such. If in a perceptual situation a double aspectivity suggests itself and asserts itself, in which divergence and convergence, laterality and profundity remain bound to each other, then something like a thing is constituted. Plessner relates this constitution in the external world back to the self-conception of the perceiver, in which interiority and appearance are intertwined. In a certain meaning, appearance is the key – indeed, the through-starting key concept for the entire conceptual concatenation of the book – which in turn connects to the motto of the rescue of appearance in the previous book."
