The real issue I've found with trying to teach this kind of lateral reading and source evaluation is that more often than not the sources encountered are not as clearly off or easy to trace to their original source(s) as something like American Renaissance.  Doing this right, especially when you are not a content or search expert who is experienced with a wide variety of online information sources, is that students, even highly motivated ones, don't have the time or patience to do it, even after they have been given some introductory tools and procedures to do so. The real solution, in my opinion, is that these types of fact checking and critical thinking skills and techniques need to be embedded into our education systems, into disciplinary curricula, in a coordinated way from elementary through post-graduate higher ed. That is very, very hard to do, but glad your Digital Polarization project is attempting to tackle it!"

You get in the car and fasten your seatbelt and you've just reduced your risk of extreme injury by an incredible amount. And I think you're right -- this stuff only provides clear answers on stuff that is extreme and at the margins.\n\nThe saving grace of that, however, is I think it gets students in the right frame of mind for deeper investigations too. What's missing IMO is some decent materials that help people understand things like astroturfing, tabloid journalism, think tank politics, funded research. Basically, if you get to the WIkipedia page and it say this is a left-leaning think tank, what does that mean? \n\nI still think these materials need to be lightweight, and need to be produced from the point of view of someone trying to make sense of a Wikipedia article or a news report, not someone preparing to go into policy or journalism. But we do need support in that area and we're looking to develop something in the next year or so."
