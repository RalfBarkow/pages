Yesterday I made a test video and posted it on #agile-cop as a teaser for a keynote I will give, perhaps electronically, at their offsite next week. Go have a look. It is 2-1/2 minutes. So tonight I was dozing and thinking about how this talk, really a talk about having perfected the agile loop, would fit into todays world. The good news is that it still fits so I can give the talk with pride. But I had to get up and think out this evolution of practices that I have here called ages. I didn't have this worked out at 3:36 when I started typing. It helped me think to be typing to you. I appreciate your assistance at this late hour. Now back to bed.\n\n"
