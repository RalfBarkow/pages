Such a systems state may be called a \"model monopoly\" in terms of the first position (A), or a \"consensual\" mono-perspective in terms of the second position (B). The conditions for its resolution (Aufhebung) are the concern of the third position (D), and will be indicated towards the end of this paper. In Plato's metaphor of ship navigation, a mono-perspective may be compared to the inability to take cross bearings at sea, which severely limits the navigation horizon. It means that an apparent dialogue becomes a monologue; that a conversational dyad is turned into a monad, incapable of consciousness since it is unable to allow for the crossing of perspectives."
