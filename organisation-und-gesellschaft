It denotes a performance that is valued for its result, but must be especially motivated because it must be assumed that the person doing the work has no desire to do it of his own accord or for its own sake (practice). Work has existed since the oldest times. It receives its structure and its motivation in primitive societies primarily through conditions of physical survival, that is, through conditions external to society. What is to be done results directly from the product of the activity. This changes in the course of the construction of more complex societies, which have to determine the required work more and more socially, because it is used for purposes which are not directly essential for the survival of the worker himself."
