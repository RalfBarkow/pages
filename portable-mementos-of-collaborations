In this way the group of wild beavers finds ways of renewal and affirmation of their togetherness, from which we still live today.\nIf in the following often the description of > archaic < and the \"modern behavioral figures and forms of experience overlap and blend with each other - not least in examples from economic and aesthetic collecting - this interference tries to do justice to the fact that on the one hand our actions and experiences move in types and schemes, in styles and institutions that we have already acquired in hunter-gatherer times, and that, on the other hand, these forms have emerged in primordial scenes - such as looking at each other, turning away from each other, turning around - that still occur in our reality and from which, if we did not already have them, we would or could form them again. Describing these scenes, situations, constellations can sometimes enable us to understand the meaning of those figures and forms anew."
