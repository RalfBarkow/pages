        "text": "> These four hypotheses arrange themselves in two groups of two each. \n\n> The first two are analytical world theories; the second two, synthetic. \n\n> * Not that the analytical theories do not recognize and interpret synthesis, and the synthetic theories analysis; but the basic facts or danda of the analytical theories are mainly in the nature of elements or factors, so that synthesis becomes a derivative and not a basic fact, while the basic facts or danda of the synthetic theories are complexes or contexts, so that analysis becomes derivative. \n\n> There is thus a polarity between these two pairs of hypotheses.\n\n> There is also a polarity between the members of each pair, and the polarity is of the same sort in each pair. \n\n> * Formism and contextualism are dispersive theories; \n\n> * mechanism and organicism, integrative theories. \n\n> * So, analysis, is treated dispersively by formism and integratively by mechanism, and \n\n> * synthesis is treated dispersively by contextualism and integratively by organicism.
