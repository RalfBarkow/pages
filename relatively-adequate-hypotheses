The parts are basic, the whole derived. \n\n> * Organicism and contextualism are synthetic: The whole is basic, the parts derived. \n\n> * Formism and contextualism are dispersive: Facts are related when they are found to be so, not by assumption. Chance, therefore, is not denied in these hypotheses. \n\n> * Mechanism and organicism are integrative: Facts are related by assumption and order is categorical. As such, chance is denied. \n\n> Dispersive world views tend to be higher in scope than in precision; integrative world hypotheses tend to be higher in precision than in scope.
