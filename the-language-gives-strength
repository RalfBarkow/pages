And even if it may seem for a moment that the possibilities of language are limited or insufficient, we will have to make use, willy-nilly, of its means, which give us hope that in the future there will be no unspoken things or misunderstandings between us.\n\nSometimes language seems weak to us. But often it is the language that gives us strength. Maybe for a moment the language goes at a distance from you, but it does not abandon you. And that is important and decisive. As long as we have our language, as long as we have at least the vague chance to explain ourselves, to tell our truth, to order our memory. That's why we speak and don't stop. Even when our throats get sore from the words. Even when you feel abandoned and empty by the words. The voice gives truth a chance. And it's important to take that chance. Maybe that's the most important thing that can happen to all of us."
