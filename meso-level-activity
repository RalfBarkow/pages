It is the place where standardised testing, improvement initiatives, system comparisons have become important, and therefore where the performance of principals and teachers is considered. The macro in our education systems is largely about control, compliance and setting direction. Its born of an industrial worldview. By its DNA it overlooks the potential in the middle levels of the education system to actually deliver the learning because of its [[Old Power]] mindsets."

Theses are the teachers and schools innovating, punching above their weight, engaging learners in new and powerful ways and connecting with community. However, a few blooms can be greatly multiplied when the interconnectedness of an ecosystem is understood and fostered in a holistic way."

It is the connections made within the garden that create, that are responsible for 'the new'. These interactions, what happens at the meso level, hold the key a re-imagined education. This is where the magic happens, where [[Collective Teacher Efficacy]] resides. "

      "text": "While my learning about the work in British Columbia, NOII in particular, had brought me to understand the importance of 'purpose, mastery and autonomy' and equally profound 'ah ha' happened during a visit to Woodcrest State College. I was enthralled by the middle leadership team (Petra, Blanche and Tammy) talking about the innovation happening in classrooms there, and student assessment data showing remarkable results. My initial thought was that I wished I had had this team in my school when I was a principal. They were engaged, leaning into the work with passion and commitment. The 'ah ha' came when I realised their principal was not in the room, that they must have been given permission to experiment, that the principal had built the psychological safety for them to do so. That this was meso level activity on display within a school. Perhaps what I learned was as much about how I hadn't created the right conditions in my schools?"

      "text": "Realizing the potential of the meso level will ultimately require a shift in the thinking at the macro, a shift in mindset of leaders in education system, the very leaders who have risen in system status by school leaders being corporate citizens, mostly by not being creative, but rather being compliant. I remember hearing Michael Fullan talk about education systems needing to better engage with principal associations for the very reason that principal were key players in the meso, key to successful change. As I was working for a professional association of school leaders this became something to pursue with system leaders, although to date nothing has eventuated, which makes me angry. Opportunity to really make a difference for students is being missed."

      "text": "School leaders can be sandwiched between school system bureaucracy and the resulting resistance to change, the [[False Sanctuary]] maintained by the mindset of compliant learners that teachers can be due to their experience in education journeys, and the mindsets of control by system leaders. This is the push down of policy and the power of the status quo. However, through a different lens, this is perhaps the most powerful of places. The caveat is that principals also recognise the power of meso level activity."

      "text": "Meso level activity can be seen in networks and communities focused on individual learners. Within schools its the activity that happens between learners in classrooms and school leadership - teachers and middle leaders. It is the work in the middle that is key to reimagining education. It is where [[Colliding Ideas]] spark innovation. While we believe macro level responses will follow, and they are ultimately desirable, responses that will not bypass the meso but engage it, it is what we do now in the middle that will transform schooling."
