The new position brought together my passion for learning, my experience as a principal, my business experience and qualifications, nearly four years in the tertiary sector and a love of design. I believed this new role was made for me."

On reflection, this was a position of calm confidence brought about by being in the flow of the conversation.

Designing spaces for other people, the drawing, the building of models, considering how a space would feel, the experience of being in it, captured my imagination. Why I didn’t go to university to undertake architecture is another story, again one about lacking confidence... about needing to find courage. However, designing a study tour for others, the learning it would provide participants was a new opportunity that delighted me. The logistics of a study tour was an element of this design, but more so was the experience of those on the study tour that was important. This is the approach I take to designing all learning experiences – and I love doing it."

The logistics of a study tour was an element of this design, but more so was the experience of those on the study tour that was important. This is the approach I take to designing all learning experiences. And I love doing it."

Designing spaces for other people, the drawing, the building of models, considering how a space would feel, the experience of being in it, captured my imagination. Why I didn’t go to university to undertake architecture is another story, again one about lacking confidence... about needing to find courage. However, designing a study tour for others, the learning it would provide participants was a new opportunity that delighted me. The logistics of a study tour was an element of this design, but more so was the experience of those on the study tour that was important. This is the approach I take to designing all learning experiences – and I love doing it."
