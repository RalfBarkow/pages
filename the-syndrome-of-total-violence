Thus, it cannot be sufficient merely to bring the technical element of the syndrome of total violence under control. Even a minimum confidence is unthinkable if the possibility of a nuclear conflict is inserted into some \"historical-pliosophical\" context, as a possibility of annihilation of the enemy of man. Any glorification of extermination violence threatens any alliance to prevent it."

If this can be thought of as attainable, the hope is not far-fetched that another, perhaps the decisive condition for building trust could come about: the hope that we could learn to see the endangerment of human lives on this side and on the other side of the borders in context. The lightning extinction by nuclear force, whoever it hits or doesn't hit, is a universal catastrophe. It brings into the world a new way of killing and being killed that drops all people into an immeasurable new vulnerability. The emotional insight that this is so may help to overcome the limitations of our capacity for consternation. What is hoped for here is not the good man, but a new power of our imagination.\n"

On the contrary, whoever asks the question about counterforces must be prepared for considerations that sound illusory.\n\nOf course, any arms limitation and any disarmament is  useful. But to stop the progression of total violence with some reliability and permanence, it is necessary not only to limit the number of weapons, but also to refrain from developing new ones. If this is not done, any agreement will be overrun in a short time by innovations that were not negotiated. To refrain from developing new weapons is either to block the translation of research into technical applications or to prevent research in the field of weapons technology altogether. Both run into infinite difficulties of detail. In general, both would be an attempt to exclude in principle man's fundamental capacity for technical manufacturing, his manufacturing intelligence, from a wide field.\nIs even the will for such an attempt conceivable? Probably only in the sign of a great fright and in the sign of the realization that the continuation of the arms competition increases the security of neither side, but increasingly reduces it. This could lead to the realization that our traditional military-strategic understanding of security no longer makes sense in the face of nuclear confrontation. The security that must be sought in this situation can only be a security of both sides.\n\nA coordination of conflict strategies in which the security of both sides is taken into account and promoted -\" presupposes, as experience shows, a minimum of trust. Thus, it cannot be sufficient merely to bring the technical element of the syndrome of total violence under control. Even a minimum of confidence is unthinkable if the possibility of a nuclear\n\n"

Even a minimum confidence is unthinkable if the possibility of a nuclear conflict is inserted into some \"historical-pliosophical\" context, as a possibility of annihilation of the enemy of man. Any glorification of extermination violence threatens any alliance to prevent it."
