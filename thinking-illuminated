I was so inspired to know more, I purchased a few copies for myself and a few members of my college Innovation Team, so that we could explore together how we might build into our school culture a clearly defined and understood vision for learning with a set of thinking skills (or learning assets) that would deepen learning, ignite curiosity and engagement, and ultimately empower all learners."

What would the lead and lag measures be and how will this research into thinking skills develop further clarity for this work?"
