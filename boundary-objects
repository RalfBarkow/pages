How do scientific communities, for example, create lasting arrangements where they address systems of objects that are simultaneously local and global, common and specialized, shared and segregated? The boundary object model assumes the fundamental ambiguity of objects (an idea taken directly from the Pragmatist notion that meaning is given in use, not in antecedent characteristics) and the durability of arrangements to manage that ambiguity in cooperative ventures. The durability implies the need to develop conventional or routine ways of working with the ambiguity; those conventions themselves may be seen as data structures from the design point of view, as material structures from the organizational point of view, or as working treaties from the political point of view."
