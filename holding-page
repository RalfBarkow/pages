At Griffin we’ve been consciously noticing what is helpful, observing the conditions that inspire and support innovation in our staff. Interestingly, we are learning powerful lessons from the behaviour of schools of fish that are guiding us as we stimulate innovation; a new meaning for our mantra, ‘We all swim together’."

It is said that undesirable behaviours can be prevented by deeper levels of engagement, that learner participation and cooperation with educators and co-learners is enhanced and that, most importantly, students are more motivated and likely to learn new skills and understandings when engaged. The ways in which we authentically ‘hook’ learners into learning new content and exploring it more deeply is therefore a critical consideration."

Our chairs are equally flexible, varying and unique, catering for a diverse range of learners and their needs and preferences.

Murdoch’s feedback poised us to consider the visible evidence of inquiry as a stance both inside our classrooms and around our school. This spurred us into action considering the walls of our classrooms, what was posted on them and why what was there mattered. ‘Mattering’ spoke of purpose to us and led to the exploration of static and dynamic displays, a controversial journey that uncomfortably cracked open some out-dated ideas."

        "text": "I love studying people. I’ve probably done it all my life but perhaps only became conscious of it in my late teens, even considering studying psychology at university. I like hypothesising what others might be thinking, how they’re feeling. I notice the way they talk and the gestures they make, fancying myself as someone who can ‘read’ people. I often consider interactions days after they’ve occurred, perhaps to gain some deeper understanding. Classic overthinker. I consider this self-proclaimed skill both a blessing and a curse – but mostly a blessing. "

Interestingly, we are learning powerful lessons from the behaviour of schools of fish that are guiding us as we stimulate innovation; a new meaning for our mantra, ‘We all swim together’."
