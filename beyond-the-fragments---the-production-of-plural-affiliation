But it’s the one that the activist can’t do without: her own perception of what pushes her own buttons depends on it (and thus her resilience and equanimity), as also does her awareness of what pushes the buttons of the others in whose lives the possibility of change lies (and thus her moderate and skilful capability in doing just that). Knowing the relations of production (and *altered* RoPs) of ‘the aesthetic’ is fundamental. Nothing could be more apparent in the times of Trumpism and Brexit, counter-terrorism and #blacklives, Fridays for Future and Facebook.\n\n"

It may be that the life of a melancholic - the life-struggle of Walker to find paths and map terrain, survive and thrive, make provision and arrive home - brings this to prominence.
