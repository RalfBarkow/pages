      "text": "Taking time out to travel is one of the defining activities enjoyed by members of modern affluent societies. As a corollary to the rise in travel for leisure, there has also been an increase in the number of travel writers who relate their encounters with other people, places and politics in various destinations around the globe. Naturally, studies of travel writing and tourism are therefore also on the increase and encompass not only the written text right across the genres, but also film and other visual representations that privilege the narratives of travel. This article will introduce a new focus on time in travel writing, which is developed throughout this special issue. After presenting an overview of the various ways in which time has become a central preoccupation in studies of travel writing, this article proposes a methodological framework for assessing the impact of competing temporalities in contemporary French travel writing – nostalgia for the past, nostalgia for the future, and futuristic projections – on intercultural relations."
