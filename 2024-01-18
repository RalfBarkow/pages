Although the patterns define relations which might be regarded as specific instances of the recursive interaction of centers, the overall view of centers gives more comprehensive and more powerful results. It directly effects your ability to make good architecture, in a way that pattern language was not yet able to do by itself. This is a much more powerful and beautiful view than what's embedded in the pattern languages, because when one has constructed this view…. you say well what is a pattern really? Then it turns out that patterns are merely a few of the structural invariants that appear within these centers under very, very particular conditions. So they're certainly interesting and important, but they don't have the same depth or the same universal character as these other structures that I'm speaking about now."

      "text": "When I first constructed the pattern language, it was based on certain generative schemes that exist in traditional cultures. These generative schemes are sets of instructions which, carried out sequentially, will allow a person or a group of people to create a coherent artifact, beautifully and simply. The number of steps vary: there may be as few as a half a dozen steps, or as many as 20 or 50. When the generative scheme is carried out, the results are always different, because the generative scheme, always generates structure that starts with the existing context, and creates things which relate directly and specifically to that context. Thus the beautiful organic variety which was commonplace in traditional society, could exist because these generative schemes were used by thousands of different people, and allowed people to create houses, or rooms, or windows, unique to their circumstances.\n\nWhen I first hit on the idea of creating, and using, pattern languages, I was inspired by these traditional generative schemes, and thought that I was essentially copying them. However, in the huge effort of creating a believable, new, pattern language, in the 1960's the effort went entirely onto the individual patterns (their formulation, verification etc.), and the idea that they were to be used sequentially, one after the other, dropped into the background. In fact, both A Pattern Language and The Timeless Way Of Building say that the pattern language is to be used sequentially. In practice, however, this feature dropped out of site, and was not emphasized in use. As a result the beautiful efficacy of traditional languages and their simple and beautiful sequential nature, disappeared from view."

It was readily apparent from the outset of this project, that currently acceptable realizations such as the Windows environment, browser formats, and various formats typical of common software such as word-processors, spread-sheets, games, advice-takers, structural design programs etc., would simply not recreate the atmosphere which actually enables a person to succeed in designing something.\n>\n> Real design requires an atmosphere of freedom, tranquillity and joyfulness, which is frighteningly rare in the computing environment. The question then, was: what kind of computer realization, what kind of screen organization, what kind of temporal organization, and what kind of format might approach the successes we have had previously in the non-computer environment?\n> \n> I therefore initiated a long series of experiments, designed, every day, to ask whether the necessary atmosphere was appearing, in any useful form, on the computer screen.\n> \n>  After writing a small bit of code, we would use it, and try it on others, asking all the time whether the experience had the necessary depth.\n> \n> The answer, nine times out of ten, was that it did not. The format of the program, and of the interface, was usually too cold, too logical, too constrained, too sterile, too unbalanced, too upsetting, too intimidating, or too didactic. It would put the user in the wrong frame of mind, nearly always, for any realistic or inspired design.\n>  \n> Whenever we sensed even an inkling of positive effect in some aspect of the program, something which in some way produced the state of mind familiar to me [[Outside]] the computer world, we kept it, and improved upon it.\n>\n> Here are a few of these positive discoveries. It is rather unusual, I would guess, to say that a computer design tool absolutely needs the following elements to really work:\n> \n>  […]\n> \n> Applying everything to the small step\n> \n> In all design, there is a moment when you are looking for information, analogous to the way a [[Cell]] applies its entire genotype to deal with the problem at hand.

Im Tauschakt wird nicht die Gleichheit zweier Waren erzeugt, sondern ihre Gleichwertigkeit, ihre Äquivalenz. In dieser Realabstraktion, in der durch die Tauschhandlung erzeugten Äquivalenz vermutet Sohn-Rethel, verkürzt gesagt, die soziogenetische Grundlegung des mathematischen Äquivalenzbegriffes."

        "text": "When I first constructed the pattern language, it was based on certain generative schemes that exist in traditional cultures. These generative schemes are sets of instructions which, carried out sequentially, will allow a person or a group of people to create a coherent artifact, beautifully and simply. The number of steps vary: there may be as few as a half a dozen steps, or as many as 20 or 50. When the generative scheme is carried out, the results are always different, because the generative scheme, always generates structure that starts with the existing context, and creates things which relate directly and specifically to that context. Thus the beautiful organic variety which was commonplace in traditional society, could exist because these generative schemes were used by thousands of different people, and allowed people to create houses, or rooms, or windows, unique to their circumstances.\n\nWhen I first hit on the idea of creating, and using, pattern languages, I was inspired by these traditional generative schemes, and thought that I was essentially copying them. However, in the huge effort of creating a believable, new, pattern language, in the 1960's the effort went entirely onto the individual patterns (their formulation, verification etc.), and the idea that they were to be used sequentially, one after the other, dropped into the background. In fact, both A Pattern Language and The Timeless Way Of Building say that the pattern language is to be used sequentially. In practice, however, this feature dropped out of site, and was not emphasized in use. As a result the beautiful efficacy of traditional languages and their simple and beautiful sequential nature, disappeared from view."
