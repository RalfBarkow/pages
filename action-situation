The number of participants and positions may vary, but there must always be participants in positions to have any structure to analyze. Similarly, there must be sets of potential actions that actors are authorized to take. Information about the situation may vary, but all participants must share some information about the situation before an analyst can even state that the participants are in an action situation. The costs and benefits assigned actions and outcomes can be thought of as the external incentives and deterrents in a situation. How these affect actions, and thus, results depends also on the resources and valuation patterns of participants."

Three participants trying to decide whether to go to the opera, a football game, or a movie is a different situation than two persons deciding as among the same options. In a three-person situation, coalitions of one subgroup against another are possible while no coalitions are possible in a two-person situation. Changing the set of alternative actions or the information conditions also fundamentally alters the structure of the situation. Using these seven types of variables, an analyst can build a wide variety of models of elementary human interactions. An exchange arrangement and a command arrangement can be constructed from the same types of variables by changing the values of some of the variables."

One of the important lessons to be learned from the recent literature on the way firms are organized in Japan is that the overall performance of a large corporation is strongly affected by the way the more elementary teams of workers are organized and how they are linked together. The recent work of Oliver Williamson (1975) on \"M-Form\" versus \"U-Form\" types of organizations also attempts to examine various ways of linking elemental work units together to examine the effects that different linkage mechanisms make."

The number of participants and positions may vary, but there must always be participants in positions to have any structure to analyze. Similarly, there must be sets of potential actions that actors are authorized to take. Information about the situation may vary, but all participants must share some information about the situation before an analyst can even state that the participants are in an action situation. The costs and benefits assigned actions and outcomes can be thought of as the external incentives and deterrents in a situation. How these affect actions, and thus, results depends also on the resources and valuation patterns of participants."

Three participants trying to decide whether to go to the opera, a football game, or a movie is a different situation than two persons deciding as among the same options. In a three-person situation, coalitions of one subgroup against another are possible while no coalitions are possible in a two-person situation. Changing the set of alternative actions or the information conditions also fundamentally alters the structure of the situation. Using these seven types of variables, an analyst can build a wide variety of models of elementary human interactions. An exchange arrangement and a command arrangement can be constructed from the same types of variables by changing the values of some of the variables."
