In doing that, we will explore measures that we can use Conant-Ashby Theory as a basis for our life. We recognize that consultants are very influential, and they are not talking about systems thinking. We need to have a conversation with them. Also, there are questions regarding what is the driving force of the systems where we are now?. Currently, there are wrong or arbitrary signals: short gains vs sustainability of the planet. There is a societal pressure to start looking for sustainable economics and ethical issues that support all economic activity. Money is a big concern, and we recognize that economics and governance are two sides of the same coin. We need new metrics to money."
