Although there can be no structureless systems, and structures can only ever be structures in a system, the two terms describe two completely different findings: whereas elements of a system are operations that, as such, must be constantly reproduced, structures condense only by repeating the identical in different combinations. Thus, the identity of the system can be maintained when its structures change. The same goes for objects, situations, periods of time, people, and so on: in all these cases, it is about meaningful combinations that become more significant as structures when it is possible to generalize their identity beyond each moment in which they take place."
