It has now become clear that all such [[transition patterns]] may be studied using the mathematical methods developed for the analysis of interregional migration flows within multiregional population systems. In consequence, the mathematical models of multiregional demography adopted by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis have been found to be applicable to a wide range of demographic topics. This article illustrates the application of these multistate models to multiple contingency calculations used in actuarial practice."

The derivation of these multidimensional forms permits simple solutions to multiple contingency problems, including moves in and out of employment, insurance, marriage, sickness, and retirement. Awkward and inaccurate approximations now commonly used can thus be replaced by matrix formulas readily manipulated by computer.\n"
