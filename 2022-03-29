The phenomenon of the consolidation of a state consciousness, even among opponents of the regime's principles since 13 August 1961, clearly shows that not only belief in values and indoctrination, but also the withdrawal of alternatives is a sociologically effective way of gaining legitimacy. With the classical dichotomy of coercion and voluntary recognition this phenomenon cannot be understood, because the essence of the process lies precisely in the unquestionable nature of a personally unattributable and thus \"unburdened\" recognition."

      "text": "Let's take another leap, this time to Warsaw of 1920, where the logician Jan Łukasiewicz is working. Logic is undergoing the most revolutionary changes since Aristotle, after mathematical techniques are applied to it for the first time. Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell, a German and an English logician, have just invented a new mathematical logic, which today is called - somewhat misleadingly - classical logic. Although this logic is a radical new development, it nevertheless adheres to the orthodoxy of the theorem of excluded thirds and the theorem of excluded contradiction. Accordingly, propositional sentences in this new logic have one of the two \"truth values\" (as logicians call them):w (true and only true) and f (false and only false). Łukasiewicz ponders whether there could be more than two, and thus invents multivalued logic - that is, logics in which there are more than two truth values.\n\n[…]\n\nLet us now set the clock back to a time in the 1st or 2nd century before our era. We are somewhere in India. Nāgārjuna, the philosophical founder of all Mahāyāna Buddhisms (of which there are many), writes his canonical text, Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (\"Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way\"). The Catu ̇sko ̇ti plays a central role in Nāgārjuna's analysis, but he gives it a surprising twist. In all Buddhist schools, a distinction is made between the conventional reality of our experience and that ultimate reality which is not veiled by our conceptual constructions. And according to Nāgārjuna, the ultimate reality is ineffable. (Remember that the Buddha refused to answer certain questions?) So there seems to be a fifth possibility beyond the four of the Catu ̇sko ̇ti: Unsayability.\nWe can easily add a fifth value to the FDE logic. Let us call this value l (for emptiness-emptiness, śūnyata, often used in Mahāyāna philosophy as a name for ultimate reality); l is the value of propositions that are unsayable-or better, of propositions that describe unsayable states; propositions themselves cannot be unsayable! Our five values now look like in the second small figure (see below right)."

      "text": "> Alain Badiou worked for about fifteen years on \"Logics of the Worlds,\" the sequel to his great work \"Being and the Event\" (published in 1988, by diaphanes in 2005). But what does continuation mean? In 1988, the ontological concern was to prove, based on mathematics, that being, conceived as such, is only indifferent manifoldness. The following problem then arises: How is it to be understood against the background of this indifference that truths not only exist, but that they also appear in certain worlds? What is the visible or objective body of a truth? It cannot be deduced from ontology. Rather, a logic of appearance, a phenomenology, must be constructed. This is precisely what the present book aims at: a \"Great Logic\" which, giving an account of the order of worlds, authorizes the thinking of truths as exceptions to that order. Contemporary materialism holds that there are only bodies and languages. The materialistic dialectic, which is worked out here to the smallest detail, asserts against it: Yes, there are only bodies and languages except that there are truths. Only in the sign of this \"except that\" a life is still possible, which would not be unworthy. A life in which the democratic individual incorporates itself into that transgression of its own existence which is called subject."

Logic is undergoing the most revolutionary changes since Aristotle, after mathematical techniques are applied to it for the first time. Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell, a German and an English logician, have just invented a new mathematical logic, which today is called - somewhat misleadingly - classical logic. Although this logic is a radical new development, it nevertheless adheres to the orthodoxy of the theorem of excluded thirds and the theorem of excluded contradiction. Accordingly, propositional sentences in this new logic have one of the two \"truth values\" (as logicians call them):w (true and only true) and f (false and only false). Łukasiewicz ponders whether there could be more than two, and thus invents multivalued logic - that is, logics in which there are more than two truth values."
