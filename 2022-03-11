War can be understood as a conflict in which the parties involved risk their survival. This applies not only to conflicts between nations, but also to other social entities such as companies, organizations, tribes, gangs, etc., and yes, even to individuals. Examples include dueling or the conflicts between spouses that sometimes end in murder and manslaughter. In this book, the conditions under which wars occur are analyzed from a systems theory perspective. The author incorporates biological and psychoanalytical models as well as sociological insights. The result is that such battles are generally not fought for the sake of any economic or libidinal interests, but are fought over seemingly antiquated values such as honor, pride, and status. In the author's view, wars are therefore to be understood as a continuation of sport by other means and, not to be neglected, as the ultimate form of entertainment - at least for the observers not directly involved."
