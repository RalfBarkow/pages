      "text": "Setting aside for the moment the obvious spinning frequently undertaken by organizations managing crises, revisions of history are actually a prevalent (if little noted) process in the life of organizations, their membership, and their leadership. Indeed, there are some interesting and informative pragmatic manifestations of this process as organizations become increasingly attuned to the need to manage the images they are projecting and the reputations they are trying to manage. Several demonstrative examples from two recent investigations are instructive. Gioia and Thomas (1996) reported revealing commentary by the executive vice-president of a major university who maintained that: ... if you tell people that your vision is that, in five, ten, or 15 years they will be seen as graduates of a great university, they will buy into it. As you go along from there, you deliver, and you deliver by images, by people's impressions of who they will have become."
