The social dimension is based on the non-identity of both communication partners and treats this non-identity as the doubled reference horizon. Of relevance here is not simply the fact that ego indicates alter’s internal horizon as a system observed in the fact dimension; rather it is of greater import that alter is also an observer operating contingently and unpredictably. Ego and alter observe one other reciprocally, and this reciprocal dependence of each on the other constitutes the social character of the difference ego/alter.\n"

      "text": "In the social dimension, a connection between perspectives is established that constitutes the world as a social world: here, different aspects, different selections, others’ experiences, consensus and dissent can be observed. The social dimension reveals itself as →[[double contingency]], the handling of which requires social systems: this double contingency leads to grasping the sociality of meaning as the plurality of perspectives of observation, and not only as a plurality of system references. Ego observes alter as an alter ego in that she duplicates the observable way in which meaning is determined. The horizons of references to the possible are therefore not limited to the fact dimension, but rather they must also be determined in the social dimension, in which the selectivity of meaning consists in the particularity of each perspective in reference to the others."

The possibility of grasping the passing of time is based on a particularly complex construction in the temporal dimension. This possibility requires two different ways of determining the present, which are only possible simultaneously. On the one hand, the present always occurs as an event—i.e., at a certain point in time—and indicates the moment in which changes become irreversible. On the other hand, this eventfulness can only be observed on the basis of a present that has duration and guarantees the possibility of reversibility. In the punctualized present, the future constantly becomes the past: this is the time measured by a clock and which passes continuously. The durative present, which holds access to the possible open, despite the irreversibility of events, is the present in which the beginning and end of periods can be determined,"
