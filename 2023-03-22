      "text": "For example, [[Circulation Realms]] suggests identifying the nested system of realms, from largest to smallest, that make up a building. Those realms should then be marked in some way, so that people using the building can easily orient themselves inside the building. But Circulation Realms of itself does not give enough of an idea of how to build a building with circulation realms, so the pattern needs to be elaborated with other patterns. The largest entrances of Circulation Realms ought to be Main Gateways, and other groups of entrances should each form a Family of Entrances. A Family of Entrances, though, needs a Main Entrance and its entrances need Entrance Transitions, and so on. Identifying Circulation Realms as a pattern in the language thus implies the addition or existence of many other, finer-grained patterns that make it up. This forces the language to grow incrementally. Circulation Realms must also be evaluated to see whether it fits well with other patterns in the language, particularly those that it ought to lie directly underneath. Adding a pattern to the language is thus a process of piecemeal growth: the change is done incrementally, and its effect on the whole evaluated at each step."
