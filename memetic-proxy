In this context, a meme is a unit of cultural information, such as a concept, belief, or behavior, that is transmitted from one individual to another through communication. A memetic proxy can serve as a shorthand for a complex idea or concept and can be used to quickly convey that idea in a way that is easily recognized and understood by others. This can be useful for communication and can help to spread ideas and information more efficiently within a culture or community.
