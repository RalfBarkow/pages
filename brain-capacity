But the brain isn't von Neumann architecture, so why so few? My personal hypothesis is that STM is an artifact of <b>consciousness</b> and is a focus area, and that's why there's so few; a consciousness <b>needs</b> no more than 5-9 chunks to perform its main function, which is examination of series of events for relevance and success probability. Oh, and of course: the limit both forces and is abetted by the highly useful <b>generalization/abstraction</b> capability of the intellect; once you get more than the limit, you've got to invent a <b>type</b> or <b>class</b> to reason about, which is something we do so deftly it's (almost) an unconscious skill. - [[Laurence Phillips]]</i>",
