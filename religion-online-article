      "text": "The positivist approach (or empiricist, or phenomenalist) emphasizes that the phenomena are given and are correlated by the formulae. While positivism may free you from certain assumptions, it involves problems. Thus, people take a certain view of the essence, which becomes too rigid. For example, classical physics or the atomic theory came at a certain stage to be regarded as the absolute truth -- the essence. The positivist was able, by means of his philosophy, to free himself from classical physics by saying that such notions were just metaphysics, so that he could consider other ideas. But in freeing himself in the first step, he became entrapped in the next step, because the phenomena inevitably depend on previous ideas to be expressed in thought. You must use some ideas to describe the phenomena, some way of thinking, and that way of thinking is generally the old way of thinking. The old way of thinking is whatever is at hand. You don’t even notice that you are using the old ideas when you describe the phenomena; for example, you put them into time and space or say that objects are solid. When you describe them, you use thought, and that thought is the old thought. Therefore, the phenomenalist point of view at first appears to free you from fixed thought, but in the very next step, it makes you very subtly a prisoner of that thought. It tends to prevent new ideas, rather than to help to fathom new ideas. Therefore, although positivism made it possible to make a step in the beginning, it has had a generally negative effect. It could also have been called \"negativism,\" I suppose."

      "text": "Our inquiry at this moment is not into nature itself, but into our way of thinking about nature. This is what is at stake. We must give quite a bit of our attention to our thinking, which itself is a part of reality. As a part of reality our thinking requires attention, just as any part of reality does. The distinction between appearance and essence is always present in our thinking. It is part of the order of thought. There is a distinction made at any moment between the content of appearance and of essence. For example, even in immediate experience, you have the table which is there and the table as you see it. But essence is not permanent either. Essence is perceived through the mind. Probably that is the case with appearance too. To say \"I have a flash of understanding, and I see\" is a form of perception -- a perception of relationship, of necessity, and so on. I call this \"insight.\" Theory is basically a form of insight. There is no meaning to the idea, I propose, that a particular insight is an ultimate or absolute truth. There is always room for a new insight, which shows the limits of a previous insight. Each thing appears to the senses, and its essence shows to the mind; that is, they are both kinds of appearances."

This is one of the key problems behind relativity, and it will be the same problem that underlies quantum mechanics. I am going to suggest that both relativity and quantum mechanics have not yet gone beyond the phenomena. They are correlations of phenomena, and people have gotten so used to correlating phenomena that they implicitly assume that that is all that they can ever do."

Their changing arrangements give the explanation of all the changes in the appearance of matter, not only the changes as you look at it, but all the changes which occur, such as burning, decay, generation. These are nothing but a rearrangement of atoms. It was not treated just as an appearance. This point is very important, and it is what positivism neglects.\n\n"

For example, in the atomic theory the essential particulars are the structures and arrangements of atoms. We are no longer talking about the way that something looks, but about the way that we think it is. (And not necessarily the way that it is; that is a more subtle question)3 The key point is that the universal theory does not merely correlate the phenomena, but it explains the very existence of the phenomena and also correlates them if it is a good theory."

        "text": "The positivist approach (or empiricist, or phenomenalist) emphasizes that the phenomena are given and are correlated by the formulae. While positivism may free you from certain assumptions, it involves problems. Thus, people take a certain view of the essence, which becomes too rigid. For example, classical physics or the atomic theory came at a certain stage to be regarded as the absolute truth -- the essence. The positivist was able, by means of his philosophy, to free himself from classical physics by saying that such notions were just metaphysics, so that he could consider other ideas. But in freeing himself in the first step, he became entrapped in the next step, because the phenomena inevitably depend on previous ideas to be expressed in thought. You must use some ideas to describe the phenomena, some way of thinking, and that way of thinking is generally the old way of thinking. The old way of thinking is whatever is at hand. You don’t even notice that you are using the old ideas when you describe the phenomena; for example, you put them into time and space or say that objects are solid. When you describe them, you use thought, and that thought is the old thought. Therefore, the phenomenalist point of view at first appears to free you from fixed thought, but in the very next step, it makes you very subtly a prisoner of that thought. It tends to prevent new ideas, rather than to help to fathom new ideas. Therefore, although positivism made it possible to make a step in the beginning, it has had a generally negative effect. It could also have been called \"negativism,\" I suppose."

        "text": "Our inquiry at this moment is not into nature itself, but into our way of thinking about nature. This is what is at stake. We must give quite a bit of our attention to our thinking, which itself is a part of reality. As a part of reality our thinking requires attention, just as any part of reality does. The distinction between appearance and essence is always present in our thinking. It is part of the order of thought. There is a distinction made at any moment between the content of appearance and of essence. For example, even in immediate experience, you have the table which is there and the table as you see it. But essence is not permanent either. Essence is perceived through the mind. Probably that is the case with appearance too. To say \"I have a flash of understanding, and I see\" is a form of perception -- a perception of relationship, of necessity, and so on. I call this \"insight.\" Theory is basically a form of insight. There is no meaning to the idea, I propose, that a particular insight is an ultimate or absolute truth. There is always room for a new insight, which shows the limits of a previous insight. Each thing appears to the senses, and its essence shows to the mind; that is, they are both kinds of appearances."

They are correlations of phenomena, and people have gotten so used to correlating phenomena that they implicitly assume that that is all that they can ever do."
