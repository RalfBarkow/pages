Control is therefore interference in one's own affairs. Any other form of external control impairs the autonomy of an operationally closed, non-trivial system. But this is precisely the rub. According to [[Helmut Willke]]'s argument, control in the sense of a controlled influence on an external system is also possible in two pathological cases – and not only possible, but the less than uplifting historical normal case: when an external agent trivializes a system, such as the \"normal\" school trivializes the schoolchild; or when a system trivializes itself vis-à-vis external claims, such as believers vis-à-vis the claims of \"normal\" churches and sects. If autonomy and self-determination are pre-contained or abandoned in this way, then the business of governance is easy – too easy."
