Really appreciate you jumping quickly in and pointing us in the right direction.\nWard and I sometime joke that the only thing more complex than cloud computing is a typical public school. Yesterday, halfway through the launch of the DiG, as the teacher was introducing the wonder room, they had an active shooter drill. So there was the teacher introducing a virtual learning space while the students were face down on the floor and her colleague was barricading the door with a desk.  I am watching all of this on a stream from across the country. Yah, we live in a curious worldâ€¦"
