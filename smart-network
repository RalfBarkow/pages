        "text": "A Smart Network\n\nThe Practical Knowledge Ecology group is an unmanageable herd of cats. As a uniting force to provide us with some context, I (Lauren Nignon) propose that we come together under the umbrella of a “smart network,” based on Chris Cook’s \"nondominium\" concept (http://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Nondominium); opt-in contracts that work as a \"club of clubs\" so that people could easily form and dissolve international associations, and which allow easier sharing of mutualized (“club” or “common”) resources. \n\nA smart network is an innovation ecosystem with collective intelligence at its center, where we focus on funding the projects that will enhance the network as a whole. Here are some aspects of a smart network: \nGood governance: a smart network doesn’t advocate any particular method of governance, but rather collects patterns of good governance and makes it easy for groups to form and choose the governance pattern that works for them. While it doesn’t advocate any particular method, it does identify the best patterns of non-coercive, peer-to-peer governance. A smart network will match the right form of governance to what a group wants and needs, whether that is a do-ocracy, a sociocracy, a dictatorship, or whatever else--but the people are clear with the benefits and drawbacks of the method that they choose. We are more concerned with “lego-fying” the environment--making governance a series of modular structures that can be interchangeable and work together, where new solutions are made visible in the network and communicated horizontally through a mycellium-like network. \nA regulatory structure: A smart network cannot function like a real government, because it cannot force its members (through the implicit threat of violence) to do anything. But it can identify smart designs and best practices in the area of currencies, companies, handling data, open source designs,  privacy,  developing better ways to handle identity, and make sure that the people and groups included in the network are following “contracts de societe” (the closest English word for this is social norms) or at least are aware of the risk factors of different designs (for example, a credit ratings agency still allows people to invest in high-risk loans, but at last they would know the level of risk). This would be a great deal of work, so we would need to identify what would need to be accomplished, and break it down into manageable chunks. People can invest in a smart network by either paying in money or by accomplishing tasks that need to be done (similar to jury duty). \nA smart network is a semi-closed membrane that is accessible to people who don’t have the money to invest in it; as long as they follow the rules. You don’t need to have money to get in and use the resources of the community, but you cannot freeload off community resources without giving something in return. Each club can set their own rules on what new members must do in order to access club resources.\nInvestment goes to the projects that would strengthen the network as a whole and make it smarter, allowing money to go to projects that don’t necessarily provide a high collar return but develop better sense-making mechanisms that allow for more signalling across the network to warn of problems or communicate successes. That said, the network should have to be self-sustaining and actually support itself with profitable businesses. But the main focus is to provide value instead of financial growth, which\nWithin the ecosystem, there would be a lot of advanced tools for information sharing and building, so constructing sophisticated stigmergic knowledge structures (based on the token-curated registry model which is starting to emerge from the blockchain) would be easy, and there would be smart algorithms for figuring out individual contributions to collaborative works. As different algorithms emerge for measuring contributions within a collaboration emerge, the smart network can assess their relative strengths and weaknesses. \nWithin a smart network, we could renegotiate new rules for intellectual property. Currently, the enclosed system of property rights creates economic friction and prohibits people from using elements of our own culture. Using a nondominium framework and new algorithms for measuring contributions, we could present the ecosystem as a new potential revenue stream for copyrighted material, in which copyright owners co-invest in advanced collaboration structures, which could be repurposed for open source science, wide scale disaster relief, and more. By reducing paperwork and easing financial friction, new structures could emerge that fundamentally challenge our current framework of intellectual property.  \nA smart network would also provide an onboarding process to welcome new members, show them around, match them up with mentors, groups, and software, and make sure that they feel supported. Members should not feel lost nor confused about how they could contribute, and we would need to proactively identify members who were disoriented.\nCommon ontology and data structures.

Here are some aspects of a smart network: \n\n1. [[Good governance]]\n1. A regulatory structure: A smart network cannot function like a real government, because it cannot force its members (through the implicit threat of violence) to do anything. But it can identify smart designs and best practices in the area of currencies, companies, handling data, open source designs,  privacy,  developing better ways to handle identity, and make sure that the people and groups included in the network are following “contracts de societe” (the closest English word for this is social norms) or at least are aware of the risk factors of different designs (for example, a credit ratings agency still allows people to invest in high-risk loans, but at last they would know the level of risk). This would be a great deal of work, so we would need to identify what would need to be accomplished, and break it down into manageable chunks. People can invest in a smart network by either paying in money or by accomplishing tasks that need to be done (similar to jury duty). \n1. A smart network is a semi-closed membrane that is accessible to people who don’t have the money to invest in it; as long as they follow the rules. You don’t need to have money to get in and use the resources of the community, but you cannot freeload off community resources without giving something in return. Each club can set their own rules on what new members must do in order to access club resources.\n1. Investment goes to the projects that would strengthen the network as a whole and make it smarter, allowing money to go to projects that don’t necessarily provide a high collar return but develop better sense-making mechanisms that allow for more signalling across the network to warn of problems or communicate successes. That said, the network should have to be self-sustaining and actually support itself with profitable businesses. But the main focus is to provide value instead of financial growth, which\n1. Within the ecosystem, there would be a lot of advanced tools for information sharing and building, so constructing sophisticated stigmergic knowledge structures (based on the token-curated registry model which is starting to emerge from the blockchain) would be easy, and there would be smart algorithms for figuring out individual contributions to collaborative works. As different algorithms emerge for measuring contributions within a collaboration emerge, the smart network can assess their relative strengths and weaknesses. \n1. Within a smart network, we could renegotiate new rules for intellectual property. Currently, the enclosed system of property rights creates economic friction and prohibits people from using elements of our own culture. Using a nondominium framework and new algorithms for measuring contributions, we could present the ecosystem as a new potential revenue stream for copyrighted material, in which copyright owners co-invest in advanced collaboration structures, which could be repurposed for open source science, wide scale disaster relief, and more. By reducing paperwork and easing financial friction, new structures could emerge that fundamentally challenge our current framework of intellectual property.  \n1. A smart network would also provide an onboarding process to welcome new members, show them around, match them up with mentors, groups, and software, and make sure that they feel supported. Members should not feel lost nor confused about how they could contribute, and we would need to proactively identify members who were disoriented.\n1. Common ontology and data structures. Investment would be made to create interoperable ontologies and data protocols to allow for deeper communication among and between different groups. \nDefense.
