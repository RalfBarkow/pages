Indeed, if these categories were automatically included at the bottom of new pages formed from [[Wiki Wiki Sandbox]], to the category home pages of newbies, and to the pages built from newbie category home pages, you would have a very convenient way of knowing that the errors of judgment were just that, and that a bit of corrective honey might be more usefully applied than the venom that I recently experienced. My errors are still my fault, and its still my job to correct them, but it honestly wasn't obvious to me, when I first arrived, that off-topic experimental behavior would not be treated gently here, or that it even be seen as off-topic. -- [[Davis Foulger]] (October, 1991) [<b>1991?!</b>]",

A category functions like a container and the problem is that nothing really fits well in a container since all things that are distinct are distinct because they have distinguishing properties. The notion of clustering seems more helpful to me. A cluster is defined by some sort of similarities or family resemblances and is more friendly than a category. The whole pattern movement is more about producing generative <i>patterns</i> that are interrelated in <i>pattern languages</i> and that's more like a cluster or a network with distance links so that clusters are things that are near one another so that a boundary with a specific radius would surround the members of the cluster. -- [[Ray Schneider]]",

I'm not sure that changes my point because I think the issue is more the connections among the pages than the connections imposed by the categories. That might really be a experimental issue. What is really being done with the categories? In fact if things are too much alike in a category, it seems like the pages that make up the category should be conflated/combined because the pages are redundant. But the connections among the pages, how one traverses from pattern element to pattern element or page to page may be more informative.

Indeed, if these categories were automatically included at the bottom of new pages formed from [[Wiki Wiki Sandbox]], to the category home pages of newbies, and to the pages built from newbie category home pages, you would have a very convenient way of knowing that the errors of judgment were just that, and that a bit of corrective honey might be more usefully applied than the venom that I recently experienced. My errors are still my fault, and its still my job to correct them, but it honestly wasn't obvious to me, when I first arrived, that off-topic experimental behavior would not be treated gently here, or that it even be seen as off-topic. -- [[Davis Foulger]] (October, 1991) [<b>1991?!</b>]",

The notion of clustering seems more helpful to me. A cluster is defined by some sort of similarities or family resemblances and is more friendly than a category. The whole pattern movement is more about producing generative <i>patterns</i> that are interrelated in <i>pattern languages</i> and that's more like a cluster or a network with distance links so that clusters are things that are near one another so that a boundary with a specific radius would surround the members of the cluster. -- [[Ray Schneider]]",
