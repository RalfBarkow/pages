Not surprisingly this demands of us recognition that its the activity in the middle levels of an organisation that is key to system growth. To enable this high levels of [[Psychological Safety]] must be established and a rhythm within the organisation of meeting, sharing and learning together established."

Itâ€™s an iterative process of checking, scanning, focusing, developing a hunch, learning and taking action.\n"
