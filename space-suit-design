Soft suits are made out of cloth; they're supposed to be flexible, but they aren't, because there are too many layers. Soft suits have gloves, hard suits have grippers. Hard suits are simpler, thus cheaper and more reliable. They're also more maneuverable and the grippers are more useful. You can do things with hard suits that are impossible with soft suits, like cover them with armour.",
