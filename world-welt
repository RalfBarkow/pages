        "text": "In this sense, the world is a paradoxical concept [→[[Paradox]]], since it conceives of itself always as a combination of determinacy and indeterminacy, of unity and difference. The world cannot be distinguished from the outside, but its unity can only be conceived as difference, for instance as the difference be- tween the self and outside the self, or between a system and its environment: we cannot indicate without distinguishing. The paradox emerges in the idea of a world that includes itself [→Re-entry]. How can we distinguish something that is the unity of every distinction? How can observers indicate the unity of the distinction between themselves and their environments? We encounter the same paradoxical situation when we start out from the idea that a distinc- tion attempts to indicate its unity—i.e., both of its sides—through only one of the two sides. This is the case, for instance, for the codes of →symbolically gen- eralized media, which, when applied to themselves, must simultaneously use a difference (that of the code) and indicate its own unity.
