      "text": "Researchers at the University of Michigan and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) discovered a cyberattack that exploits networks used by aircraft, spacecraft, energy generation systems, and industrial control systems. The PCspooF exploit targets the time-triggered ethernet (TTE) system, which lowers costs in high-risk settings by allowing mission-critical and less-critical devices to operate on the same network hardware. PCspoof mimics switches in TTE networks to send out malicious synchronization messages masked by electromagnetic interference. The disruption gradually causes time-sensitive messages to be dropped or delayed, with potentially disastrous effects. The researchers said the exploit can be prevented by replacing copper Ethernet cables with fiber-optic cables, or by deploying optical isolators between switches and untrusted devices."
