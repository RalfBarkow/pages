We speak in a linear flow of words, but what of the non-linear flow of music and poetry and dance? We read books that display strings of tokens but what of the display of illustrations and photographs and videos and websites? Our digital computation tools can render both lines of text and dynamic images but that which is encoded within huge strings of binary digits has no knowledge of context or environment. Symbolic computation cannot make a [[Distinction]], cannot have an idea; it can neither know nor deceive itself."
