Measuring the national and planetary minimum requirements will tell us if we succeed. The good news: we can be successful regarding sustainable development without exactly knowing what it is, and how it can be measured in detail."

At present, we need nations state and an assembly of nation states to monitor, develop effective policies and reach agreements. Especially by the lack of alternatives. Leaving everything to a market, or to individual actions will allow rentseekers and freeriders to not do what is necessary. And the collective effort may be at risk of being too little, too late."
