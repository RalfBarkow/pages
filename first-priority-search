Different search engines are being accessed by most of the people accessing the web in the modern world. To retrieve the best results, many times the user accesses different search engines, because every search engine uses different logic to retrieve information from its own database repository. During this process, the user encounters repetition in the search results and irrelevant search results. It takes much time and effort for the user, especially in technical, research, literature, science, education, etc., fields. Ultimate Search Engine provides the functionality to manage search results from different search engines in one place with the flexibility of run time search engine selection. Ultimate Search Engine provides a unique result set of different search engines with load balancing on the web."
