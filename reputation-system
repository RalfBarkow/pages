They're all examples of successful reputation systems that enable consumer websites to manage and present user contributions most effectively. Randy will talk about these examples and why reputation systems are critical for any organization that draws from or depends on user-generated content. \n\n\"Randy\" Farmer has been creating online community systems for over 30 years, and has co-invented many of the basic structures for both virtual worlds and social software. His accomplishments include numerous industry firsts (such as the first virtual world, the first avatars, and the first online marketplace). Randy worked as the community strategic analyst for Yahoo!, advising Yahoo properties on construction of their online communities. Randy was the principal designer of Yahoo's global reputation platform and the reputation models that were deployed on it.\n\nSlides available at http://www.slideshare.net/soldierant/5-reputation-missteps-and-how-to-avoid-them"

The core difference between reputation systems and collaborative filtering is the ways in which they use user feedback. In collaborative filtering, the goal is to find similarities between users in order to recommend products to customers. The role of reputation systems, in contrast, is to gather a collective opinion in order to build trust between users of an online community."
