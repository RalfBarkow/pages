We can elect, for instance, to build James forms out of physical objects such as blocks, or out of physical enclosures such as rooms. The James axioms define the coordinated behavior of various patterns of containment. A sequence of structural transformations can be animated. The creation, deletion and rearrangement acts that constitute both proof and computation can be presented in videos as dynamic animations. Many transformations can happen at the same time since (other than containment) each container is independent of the others."
