Replication-competent recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes provide valuable tools to investigate viral infection. Low levels of reporter gene expressed from previous reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 have jeopardized their use to monitor the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro or in vivo. Here, we report an alternative strategy where reporter genes were placed upstream of the viral nucleocapsid gene followed by a 2A cleavage peptide. The higher levels of reporter expression using this strategy resulted in efficient visualization of rSARS-CoV-2 in infected cultured cells and K18 hACE2 transgenic mice. Importantly, real-time viral infection was readily tracked using a non-invasive in vivo imaging system and allowed us to rapidly identify antibodies which are able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Notably, these reporter-expressing rSARS-CoV-2 retained wild-type virus like pathogenicity in vivo, supporting their use to investigate viral infection, dissemination, pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo."
