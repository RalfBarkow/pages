No any analytical thinking from a particular angle can grasp the wholeness. Only the human being, using the feels, can grasp the wholeness. So step back and use your feels about the wholeness, which you are actually using every day unconsciously. Christopher Alexander provided base for arguments in his book Nature of Order. (He said most people will be able to give the correct answer to various types of questions he asked.) If you want scientific argument, you can argue on these basis.

The \"object oriented\" software community was small and very rarified at that time, and the Smalltalk community even more concentrated. Ward and Kent were very well known in that Smalltalk community, very highly regarded, and all of us paid a great deal of attention to their ideas and contributions. Many of us read Alexander's material, many of us saw the immediate application to object-oriented software - and Ward and Kent, virtually single-handedly, verbalized that abstract recognition into concrete, useful, and enormously influential pragmatics. I mean no criticism of any of the [[Gang Of Four]], and their volume brought it to the larger software community.

No any analytical thinking from a particular angle can grasp the wholeness. Only the human being, using the feels, can grasp the wholeness. So step back and use your feels about the wholeness, which you are actually using every day unconsciously. Christopher Alexander provided base for arguments in his book Nature of Order. (He said most people will be able to give the correct answer to various types of questions he asked.) If you want scientific argument, you can argue on these basis.

The \"object oriented\" software community was small and very rarified at that time, and the Smalltalk community even more concentrated. Ward and Kent were very well known in that Smalltalk community, very highly regarded, and all of us paid a great deal of attention to their ideas and contributions. Many of us read Alexander's material, many of us saw the immediate application to object-oriented software - and Ward and Kent, virtually single-handedly, verbalized that abstract recognition into concrete, useful, and enormously influential pragmatics. I mean no criticism of any of the [[Gang Of Four]], and their volume brought it to the larger software community.
