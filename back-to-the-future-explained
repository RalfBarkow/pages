It would have no idea whatsoever. It would flash in and out of existence in the very same step. That is, it is the field at that point. You might think of the field over a period of time as an entity of some sort having an identity, but this will not work, because you could have taken equally as well another Lorentz frame in which the identity was the field along another space-time track. In other words, it is highly arbitrary to associate field points along a certain line and say they belong to some mathematical entity. In fact nothing but this point event is a basic concept. Anything you build is a structure of point events -- an interrelated or correlated structure. But any such structure is a process. Any order of point events can only be understood in this flowing movement -- as process. The essence is process."
