It is the new rules and relationships that are needed, not the destruction of the local relationships that are embodied in local institutions. The implications and potential wisdom of this knowledge if it were enacted is a reversal of the regional and national aggregation of hospital and medical systems and the re-localization, reconceptualization within the communities of relevance and trust. This aggregation is done in the interest of the owners and managers of these mega institutions, not in the interest of the communities in need of medical services.\no\tWe should match the solution of community problems (governance) to the socio-geographic scale of the problem, and we must avoid creating problem solving (governance) that is too large for the problem context.\n•\t We have learned that participation (true citizenship) is absolutely key to solving complex problems and that both relevance and trust are key to participation.

This fact may offer relevant insight into ACHs, hospitals, insurance functions, etc. I think what is being aimed at here is the profound difference between efficiency and effectiveness. When our health and wellbeing are at stake I hope that we can elevate effectiveness over efficiency. The unintended and delayed effect of ineffectiveness is increased costs--therefore lower actual efficiency, over time.

Our great challenge is to distill the mix of health services into support functions and direct health care and look for efficiencies in the support functions, not in the direct care. The gold standard for direct services must become effectiveness--as determined by the users, not the providers alone.
