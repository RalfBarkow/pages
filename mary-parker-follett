Her early education was at the Thayer Academy, where she studied philosophy and the scientific method nurtured her idealistic, philosophic thinking. During her teen years Follett’s father died, which with another inheritance gave her an independent income but also required her to assume responsibility for the care of her mother and brother. In 1888 Follett entered Radcliffe College, which was called Harvard’s Annex for Women at the time. There she studied economics, government, and philosophy and was influenced by Albert Bushnell Hart who specialized in historical fact and political analysis (Crawford, 1971; Parker, 1984; Persons, 2002; Smith, 2002)."

      "text": "After graduation, Follett spent a year in Paris in postgraduate study, and upon returning to Boston began her initial public activity in the field of social work. Working among the poor and disadvantaged of Roxbury, Follett created social, athletic, and educational clubs for men, one of which was housed in a public school building. This initiative was the first of its kind in demonstrating the value of using school buildings after hours for community activities. In 1908 the Women’s Municipal League supported the creation of “school community centers” and made Follett the chairman of the committee to accomplish this. Based on her work in creating community centers, Follett was appointed to the first Placement Bureau Committee for vocational guidance and identification of job opportunities, appointed a member of the Massachusetts Minimum Wage Board, and was elected vice president of the National Community Center Association. These commitments involved working with industry and served to broaden Follett’s interest from political and social to industrial relations (Parker, 1984; Persons, 2002; Smith, 2002)."

      "text": "As a result of her community work experience, Follett changed her view of democracy, promoting governance through local neighborhood networks, which she advocated in her book [[The New State]] published in 1918. This work brought her international recognition as a leading political scientist and authority on business administration. In 1924 Follett published the Creative Experience reflecting her expanding interest in industrial relations and management. In this book Follett advocated the creative encounter of individuals from different classes and occupations coming together in small groups to solve social problems through the integration of experiences. According to Follett, integration rather than conflict was the answer to industrial relations (Crawford, 1971; Parker, 1984; Persons, 2002; Smith, 2002)."

      "text": "As her reputation grew, Follett gave lectures at Metcalf’s Bureau of Personnel Administration in New York and at the Rowntree Lecture Conferences in Oxford, England living intermittently in both England and the United States. Follett was also actively involved with the League of Nations and was a member of the Taylor Society. During this time many of Follett’s lectures were published along with several shorter articles, and she contributed to edited works by Henry Metcalf on management -- Scientific Foundations of Business Administration, 1926; Business Management as a Profession, 1927; and The Psychological Foundations of Management, 1927. These lectures and her writings helped to maintain Follett’s position in the late 1920s as a popular lecturer on adult education, industrial relations, business management, and public administration. In 1933 Follett returned to the United States from England to attend to personal matters, where she died following an operation on December 8, 1933 at the age of sixty-five (Parker, 1984; Persons, 2002; Smith, 2002)."

      "text": "As a person, Mary Parker Follett has been described as energetic, childlike in her views, dogmatic, sometimes arrogant, provocative and stimulating. However, her most endearing quality was her ability to give each person she interacted with the feeling that she was genuinely interested in him or her allowing her to develop and maintain deep, lifelong friendships with both men and women (Crawford, 1971). Follett’s friendship with philanthropist Pauline Agassiz Shaw provided backing and support for many of the initial community center programs she established. Her collaboration with Eduard Lindeman, a social scientist, resulted in the publication of Follett’s Creative Experience. Follett actively worked on behalf of women’s suffrage, civil education, vocational guidance, and the development of neighborhood centers by cultivating neighborhood support, political support, negotiating conflicts of interest, and advocating for enabling legislation (Tonn, 1999)."

In 1924 Follett published the Creative Experience reflecting her expanding interest in industrial relations and management. In this book Follett advocated the creative encounter of individuals from different classes and occupations coming together in small groups to solve social problems through the integration of experiences. According to Follett, integration rather than conflict was the answer to industrial relations (Crawford, 1971; Parker, 1984; Persons, 2002; Smith, 2002)."

Follett was also actively involved with the League of Nations and was a member of the Taylor Society. During this time many of Follett’s lectures were published along with several shorter articles, and she contributed to edited works by Henry Metcalf on management -- Scientific Foundations of Business Administration, 1926; Business Management as a Profession, 1927; and The Psychological Foundations of Management, 1927. These lectures and her writings helped to maintain Follett’s position in the late 1920s as a popular lecturer on adult education, industrial relations, business management, and public administration. In 1933 Follett returned to the United States from England to attend to personal matters, where she died following an operation on December 8, 1933 at the age of sixty-five (Parker, 1984; Persons, 2002; Smith, 2002)."

Her collaboration with Eduard Lindeman, a social scientist, resulted in the publication of Follett’s Creative Experience. Follett actively worked on behalf of women’s suffrage, civil education, vocational guidance, and the development of neighborhood centers by cultivating neighborhood support, political support, negotiating conflicts of interest, and advocating for enabling legislation (Tonn, 1999)."
