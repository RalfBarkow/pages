It allows some dynamic code update but the core part of Greenlight does not really used the live programming feature. I just kept reloading the page after code change in the end. (That is very different now as features we make in Croquet Microverse typically use the text editor integration feature.) So to have your app embedded in Greenlight, it can be written in any way as long as it can be opened in an iframe. Of course you can add your feature to the open source Greenlight and deploy it.

(The video chat feature of Croquet Greenlight is implemented that way). That uses a third-party service (Agora, Skyway and Jitsi are the ones we tried and lately we use Agora mostly), and they [[provide]] SFU (for a fee)."

On top, we have recently extended Matrix to support scalable decentralised E2EE group voice and video calling too (MSC3401). These are the base building blocks for visionary applications such as Element Call as well as the open metaverse (aka third room).\n\nFor the sake of scalability and reliability in conferencing, a selective forwarding unit (SFU) has proven to be one of the crucial components. The concept is already part of MSC3401. The VoIP team will be responsible for designing and implementing a Matrix compatible SFU which can be extended to support a generic media connector model. We also aim to connect to more legacy systems, e.g., SIP / PSTN, as we are trying to work on interoperability with a unified collaboration & communication vision.\n\nCurrently Element Call relies on a full-mesh node setup. You’d come along to help evolve the SFU, using a modern stack that ensures future compatibility and an end-to-end responsibility for VoIP conferencing. "

        "text": "> Element is heavily investing in building out Matrix as the missing signalling layer for WebRTC: providing an open and decentralised E2EE transport for negotiating media streams and data channels. On top, we have recently extended Matrix to support scalable decentralised E2EE group voice and video calling too (MSC3401). These are the base building blocks for visionary applications such as Element Call as well as the open metaverse (aka third room).\n\nFor the sake of scalability and reliability in conferencing, a selective forwarding unit (SFU) has proven to be one of the crucial components. The concept is already part of MSC3401. The VoIP team will be responsible for designing and implementing a Matrix compatible SFU which can be extended to support a generic media connector model. We also aim to connect to more legacy systems, e.g., SIP / PSTN, as we are trying to work on interoperability with a unified collaboration & communication vision.\n\nCurrently Element Call relies on a full-mesh node setup. You’d come along to help evolve the SFU, using a modern stack that ensures future compatibility and an end-to-end responsibility for VoIP conferencing. "

A collaborative app (even Google Docs for that matters) can be opened in the Custom App window, which is accessible by pressing and  holding the \"Web Page\" button.

It has some support for  live programming feature you saw in the movie. It allows some dynamic code update but the core part of Greenlight does not really used the live programming feature. I just kept reloading the page after code change in the end. (That is very different now as features we make in Croquet Microverse typically use the text editor integration feature.) So to have your app embedded in Greenlight, it can be written in any way as long as it can be opened in an iframe. Of course you can add your feature to the open source Greenlight and deploy it.

It has some support for  live programming feature you saw in the movie. It allows some dynamic code update but the core part of Greenlight does not really used the live programming feature. I just kept reloading the page after code change in the end. (That is very different now as features we make in Croquet Microverse typically use the text editor integration feature.) So to have your app embedded in Greenlight, it can be written in any way as long as it can be opened in an iframe. Of course you can add your feature to the open source Greenlight and deploy it. (Thanks for asking this question!)"

        "text": "The Greenlight itself is written in the Virtual DOM Framework. It has some support for  live programming feature you saw in the movie. It allows some dynamic code update but the core part of Greenlight does not really used the live programming feature. I just kept reloading the page after code change in the end. (That is very different now as features we make in Croquet Microverse typically use the text editor integration feature.) So to have your app embedded in Greenlight, it can be written in any way as long as it can be opened in an iframe. Of course you can add your feature to the open source Greenlight and deploy it. (Thanks for asking this question!)"

(The video chat feature of Croquet Greenlight is implemented that way). That uses a third-party service (Agora, Skyway and Jitsi are the ones we tried and lately we use Agora mostly), and they [[provide]] SFU (for a fee)."
