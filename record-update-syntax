Simply put, the Elm programming language transforms the way you think about frontend web development. Elm’s legendary compiler is an incredible assistant, giving you the precise and user-friendly support you need to work efficiently. Elm applications have small bundle sizes that run faster than JavaScript frameworks and are famously easy to maintain as they grow. The catch? Elm isn’t JavaScript, so you’ll have some new skills to learn. “Elm in action” teaches you the Elm language along with a new approach to coding frontend applications. Chapter by chapter, you’ll create a full-featured photo-browsing app, learning as you go about Elm’s modular architecture, Elm testing, and how to work seamlessly with your favorite JavaScript libraries. You’ll especially appreciate author and Elm core team member Richard Feldman’s unique insights, based on his thousands of hours writing production code in Elm. When you’re done, you’ll have a toolbox of new development skills and a stunning web app for your portfolio\n"
