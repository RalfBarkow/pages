Raised in a long family tradition of healing and spirituality, Hua-Ching Ni spent his youth learning from highly-achieved masters in the mountains of China. He is the beneficiary of a broad spiritual tradition passed down since the golden age of China and is the author of over 40 books on Taoism, natural healing and spirituality."
