They need to go through many of the same processes of discovery in order to make new ideas their own. Because discovery is really difficult and has taken hundreds of years, the difference is that children have to be scaffolded carefully (but not using the Socratic method, it “leads the witness” too much). Instead the scaffolding has to be set up as close encounters and careful but invisible [[Sequencing]] to allow the children to make the final leaps themselves. This was the genius of Mary Quirk. It was interesting that we never found out what she knew. She was *focused on what __we__ knew and could find out*."
