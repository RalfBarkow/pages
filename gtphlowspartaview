That led me to think that I did not really understand how Bloc drew a rectangle, or circle on the screen, for example, so went down a rabbit hole. `BlStadium` got me understanding a bit more how to use drawing primitives to draw a vector shapes in a Sparta canvas, created `BlPizza` along the way, then I wanted to see if one could continue adding points to a `SkiaPathBuilder` after it had been rendered on screen, well, you CAN!!
