Bernhard said RLAs offer &quot;a high degree of accuracy and transparency without the enormous undertaking that is counting every contest on every ballot by hand.&quot; The researchers said most scenarios would fit one of three RLA levels. Ballot comparison audits, described as most efficient and precise, involve paper ballots being individually numbered by the ballot scanner, so auditors can verify the corresponding electronic record. Less precise are ballot-polling audits, which compare a random sample of ballots to electronic totals, and batch comparison audits, which compare groups of ballots."
