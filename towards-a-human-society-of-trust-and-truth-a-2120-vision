The definition of ourself has expanded to include the whole System.\n2) We take care of [[our relationships]]. This enables us to achieve (1). Strong relationships are built on trust. \n3) We seek to discover and share the [[truth]]. This enables us to achieve (2). And takes us from Pre-tense to Pre-Sense.\n# Education\n\nEducation is seen as a lifelong activity. It is free. Individuals are encouraged to find their talent (purpose) then use it for the good of the whole. All talents are equally [[valued]] so [[payment]] (whether in money or in kind) is not a distraction from true purpose.\nThere is no formal school structure as such. School has moved in focus from 3Rs (Reading, Remembering, Regurgitating) to 4Is (Impact, Interactions, Insight, Intervention). Small groups of children are [[coached]] by elders (people who are held in high esteem for their wisdom and [[facilitation]] skills.) There are no formal teachers. Everything is seen as a teacher. The question is always what can I learn from this X?"
