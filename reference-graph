Thus all sub-graphs rooted by each of the source node must be searched. Suppose 10 documents are cited by each document. The length of the longest path beginning from the source node is L. The cost of identifying the best related sub-graph will be 10^L. The cost of this operation is intolerable."

To find all the interested documents about a research problem, we must know what the users' interest is. User interest can be reflected by a few given documents. There are two methods to find them.
