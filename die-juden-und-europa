      "text": "As far as the relationship of critical theory to the concrete question of Jewish sovereignty is concerned, in certain respects the constellation of the 1930s was repeated in the late Horkheimer. In his essay [[Die Juden und Europa]] (The Jews and Europe), completed in the first days of September 1939, he had wanted to recognize the problem he believed to see in the existence of a Jewish state in his notes in the accommodation of the Jews in the Diaspora: settling in with the existing; leniency in the face of the damage to bourgeois democracy; flirting with the powers of reaction, as long as it was not too openly anti-Semitic. The Jews thus betrayed their best traditions, they had \"once been proud of abstract monotheism, the rejection of belief in images, the refusal to make a finite into an infinite.\" Their distress today \"refers them back to this. The disrespect for a being that spreads itself into a god is the religion of those who, in the Europe of the Iron Heel, do not refrain from turning their lives to the preparation of the better one \"3."

[[Gershom Scholem]], who himself had suspected something of this catastrophe since his youth, nevertheless regarded Horkheimer's text as \"a wholly useless product\" - and in it a reprint of Marx's article on the Jewish question, as he told Benjamin, who had asked him for his opinion: The comparison with Marx's essay was not only obvious, but Horkheimer had wanted to write this essay again, mutatis mutandis, \"for the situation 100 years after Marx (which did not exactly put the wisdom of that - repugnant - essay in the brightest light, as much as it was fashionable to quote it at times).\" Obviously, Scholem reminded here the determination of the Jews to the sphere of circulation, which Horkheimer seems to base the need for assimilation, according to his diagnosis, on the \"self-interest\" and \"haggling\", in which the young Marx had seen the \"worldly reason and cultus of Judaism\". But in essence, his polemic is aimed at Horkheimer's complete failure to recognize the real situation of the Jews in the face of National Socialism. The adaptation of Marx's Jewish Question, he argues, as \"an encouragement to the Jews in the Second World War ... rat-less like ghost speech\".4 Thus, Horkheimer seemed to want to explicate his famous dictum: \"But whoever does not want to speak of capitalism should also be silent about fascism\" by addressing it to the Jews of all people: \"Practical adaptation may be inevitable for the individual, the concealment of the contrasts between the concept of man and capitalist reality deprives thinking of any truth. ... The confusion has become so general that the less truth aims at the supposed practice, the greater its practical dignity. \"5 Ghost speech could become that because the appeal not to desist from turning one's life to the preparation of the better presupposes what can no longer be presupposed at all for the Jews: to survive. Thus, if the practical adaptation of the individual in order to merely survive does not enter into thinking itself, the contrasts between the concept of man and capitalist reality become conceptual ghosts.

Horkheimer's essay also merely reinforced his conviction \"that here, unfortunately, only the metaphysicians have anything useful to say on the matter.\" 6 What Scholem meant here becomes clear in the passage from Horkheimer's essay, which states that the Jews \"as agents of circulation\" have been \"disempowered\" by the Fuehrer state because the modern structure of the economy puts the whole sphere largely out of course; they are therefore only \"hit as the first victims by the dictates of the rulers, who take over the function that has fallen out.\" Thus, the hatred of Jews belongs to the phase of fascist rise, but in the totalitarian order itself anti-Semitism will find a natural end.7"

It turned out that anti-Semitism, unlike any other prejudice, even a racist one, raises the question of totality in nuce by answering it with annihilation - the question of how the unity of society is established in consciousness as well as in politics. This shows the weakness of the concept of state capitalism with which Horkheimer, following [[Friedrich Pollock]], tries to grasp the totalitarian order and according to which it is in principle possible for the state, whether in the New Deal of Roosevelt's USA or in the economic miracle of Hitler's Third Reich, to eliminate the sphere of circulation. As if it could be completely annulled in Germany without at the same time, as [[Karl Kraus]] already knew, reducing \"the life of the state, of the economy, of the cultural exercise to the simplest formula\": \"that of annihilation \"8 - not of the rule of man over man, whose formula has become the law of value, but of annihilation aimed at the \"total enemy\". To this formula, which the concept of state capitalism did not know, then also belongs that in the process whoever stands in the way or puts himself in the way can still be included in varying degrees as an aspect of that total enemy at any time."

Metaphysics means, not least, that the subject matter itself does not at all develop like a mere (natural) scientific problem, but rather in the reflection on how to think and act (possible) at all, which precedes the sciences. In other words: The appeal to the Jews, which Horkheimer wrote down in 1939, believed himself to be further secured by Marx's categorical imperative as far as the existential judgment on society was concerned; he did not yet know anything about it, nor could he have known that the reality of National Socialism would force a new one and thus metaphysical questions would return, which seemed to have been buried long ago with Hegel's Weltgeist, i.e.: resolved materialistically with Marx's critique of political economy. It is hardly by chance that the categorical imperative after Auschwitz should then find itself formulated in the part of the Negative Dialectic that bears the title \"Meditations on Metaphysics\"."

Since they want to see in those identified as agents of circulation, beyond all sociological attribution, at the same time the abstract side of capital indispensably embodied, and in this embodiment a worldwide conspiracy, their hatred of the Jews is precisely the epitome of the whole as the untrue; Not one of the aspects of this whole like racism, but the utmost, total consequence of the dialectic of enlightenment, of the transformation of the outmoded reason into modernized barbarism - so that the new imperative must be directed to what can be directly opposed to the deadly threat of the Jews as long as the dialectic of enlightenment continues."

But derivation and reduction are now in a changed context. The perspective on the possible abolition of domination and violence can in principle no longer be separated from the struggle against the anti-Semitic delusion. When Adorno and Horkheimer write that the \"turnaround\" depends on \"whether the ruled become powerful in the face of absolute madness and put a stop to it, \"9 the ruled are no longer thought of only as a class or classes, but at the same time as individuals; the derivation is broken at a certain point and the functioning is viewed from the individuals, who can no longer be denied responsibility for it. In the face of that madness that has become abso- lute, critical theory itself has regained its concept of totality, which goes beyond mere sociological attribution and class affiliation, just as in the future no reflection on the abolition of domination will be possible for it without at the same time reflecting on the possible threat to the Jews."

Certain sections of it could be misunderstood as \"a rejection of Israel and the Jews in Germany themselves. \"10 Likewise, in 1961, he formulated another intellectual consequence to be drawn from The Jews and Europe, because the revolutionary possibility that essay believed it could directly envisage had been dementized by National Socialism: namely, that Zionism had been proven right. \"Herzl's book Der Judenstaat, which marks the beginning of the Zionist movement, embodies the doubt about the ability of European states to take the idea of pluralism seriously in the long run, that is, to leave the particular free to surrender to its own principle within the general. The Zionist movement, which no longer trusts the chance of pluralism of the culture of the autonomous individual in Europe, forms the simultaneously radical and resigned reaction of Judaism to the possibilities opened up in the last century. It is the bleakest aspect of the history that has taken place since then, the bleakest both for Judaism and for Europe, that Zionism was right. \"11 In a late letter, Horkheimer once again raises the \"difficult problem\" of \"uniting the state of Israel with the Jewish expectation of messianism\": he knows only one answer: \"that it first requires a 'practical solution'. \"12"

In this respect, Horkheimer was hardly under any illusions throughout his life: \"Industrially advanced ... States, not to mention Stalinist Russia, did not wage war on Germany because of Hitler's terror, which they regarded as an internal affair, but for motives of power politics. \"13 But since the beginning of the war he felt compelled to distinguish between the powers in detail, depending on whether they practiced the terror themselves or not, and which of them - for reasons that were not of interest at first - could rather help to push it back. The powerlessness in the face of the impossibility to participate in a revolutionary action against any power politics was confronted with the compulsion for a practical solution in the defense against the worst - in this constellation only the 'metaphysical' foundations of the anti-Semitic madness and at the same time its own preconditions, the condition of the possibility of critique, were revealed to critical theory. Because it was recognized that such a solution was absolutely necessary, which was therefore no longer an aiming at merely supposed practice, something of these preconditions could emerge that had previously remained unexplained. To search for it without affirming this practice as legitimation of the existing is freely possible only if critique continues to \"relinquish the prejudice\" that \"some moment of the existing material reality is directly the positive\".14 It is precisely a matter of defending the presuppositions of critique, which cannot directly be the positive and must not be hypostatized as a positive standpoint, solely for the sake of the indirect possibility of critique, which, however, now coincides with the indirect defense against the politics of annihilation. Here, the experience of powerlessness may occur again and again with necessity: this experience guarantees that there is no such positive thing. If Horkheimer had once formulated that \"the totalitarian order is nothing else\" than \"its predecessor, which has lost its inhibitions, \"15 then he now recognizes that it is these inhibitions that can be important and names them, for example, as the \"power of resistance\" of law.16 He thus retrospectively agrees with those who have been criticized for their powerlessness. He thus retrospectively agrees with those whom he had so sharply criticized in The Jews and Europe, because they trusted that \"somewhere the reformation of Western capitalism is taking place more smoothly than that of German capitalism and that well-recommended foreigners still have a future\".17 Where this is really the case, where the power of resistance of law is still effective, is now unexpectedly part of the task of critical theory.

Whatever was set in motion in the states as a reaction to the world economic crisis was to be brought to a common denominator in it, whereby some essential provisions of Marx's critique had to lose their immediate validity. One consequence of this was that at the Institute for Social Research the view actually prevailed that the international solidarity of the capitalist classes made war improbable18 - as if state capitalism, which prevailed over all, would already produce a globally ruling sovereign under whose wing the capitalists could, as it were, be unrestrainedly solida- ric among themselves; As if the war between the states, possible at any time, were not the essence of the state and therein the indispensable guarantor that in the states themselves accumulation in the capitalist mode can take place at all."

Students of Carl Schmitt, who understood how to turn doctrine against the teacher, who made their disappointment with Schmitt's behavior after 1933 productive in a radical critique of the latter's concept of the political, provided the essential impetus here to expose the blind spot in the talk of state capitalism and at the same time to relate Marx's concept of crisis to the state in a new way: Otto Kirchheimer and Franz Neumann."

That the \"primacy of politics\" over economics was thus by no means established and could never be established within the boundaries of the nation-state, he tried to prove by means of empirical studies of the German economy and fundamentally doubted the stability of the Nazi system, convinced that the capitalist contradictions in Germany had to have an effect on a 'higher' level, even if they were concealed by a bureaucratic apparatus and Volksgemeinschafts propaganda; on a higher level meant: that they made war and ruthless expansion inevitable.19"

He took it up and radicalized it: Ultimately, it was questionable whether a formally or functionally uniform sovereign political power still existed in Germany at all. Accordingly, National Socialism should be understood not only as the abolition of the rule of law, but as a process in which its condition, the unified sovereign power, dissolves. Neumann spoke of the \"extreme formlessness\" to which this state was drifting, which as a result could no longer be called a state at all. Accordingly, one should rather speak of \"gangs\" - or to use Horkheimer's term: of \"rackets\" - whose leaders are constantly forced to get along again after disputes. In this respect, National Socialism no longer possesses a unified apparatus of coercion; it disintegrates into several political powers - Ernst Fraenkel had already characterized it in precisely this sense as a \"double state \"20 - which strike all the more brutally because their relations are not institutionalized, but are merely carried out personally. This personal unification, which is to be established ad hoc, can no longer be considered a unity in the sense of a state system, whether democracy or dictatorship: National Socialism, according to Neumann, was a non-state, an anarchy and a chaos."

However, it says something about how far he was able to push the analysis when the first and most important study of the extermination of the European Jews was written by one of his students: Raul Hilberg took over from Neumann, as he himself sees it in retrospect, the notion of National Socialism as a \"non-state,\" where the \"ruling elites\" did not operate on a \"unified, rational basis, such as we associate with a legislature or a constitution.\" 21 At the same time, however, Hilberg speaks of a \"bias\" related to Neumann's Marxism: he had quite correctly analyzed Aryanization and the liquidation of Jewish property as a means by which the concentration tendencies of German industry were increased, but he could not then \"fully face the fact after all that the Jewish people were annihilated as such.\" 22 Hilberg took exactly this step - and necessarily the perspective was reversed: He viewed all processes from the \"German extermination efforts\", which he in turn knew to presuppose, and deduced from these efforts themselves the splitting of society into independent groupings as a necessity: As this process of extermination progressed, its requirements became more complex, it required a constantly growing number of authorities, party offices, business enterprises and military agencies to handle it.23 The extermination of the Jews, Hilberg writes, \"was a total process\"; the machinery necessary for it could not be distinguished \"fundamentally from the German social structure as a whole.

If, on the other hand, the inner contradictions, which in the history of Critical Theory showed themselves in the critique of the state and anti-Semitism, are not unfolded, if concepts such as that of the administered world are rather used to camouflage them, then the possibility is also lost of still \"empowering\" its experience in the sense of Walter Benjamin's thesis: how it \"flashes up in the moment of danger\". Flashing here means that always only the most abstract point of contact is to be fixed, the current threat is directly considered against the background of what Neumann once called Behemoth. But it is precisely the most abstract that proves to be immensely effective for the concrete analysis: on the one hand, the determination that society disintegrates into bands in the crisis and that, precisely in this, mediation through the spheres of circulation and law is eliminated, the rackets thus becoming the predominant form of the political; on the other hand, that unity in this disintegration in society and in the consciousness of it is only established through the imagination of a Jewish world conspiracy, in which mediation and circulation return distorted into a delusion."

Above all, it also concerns the ideological shape of the world conspiracy itself: Just as unity is established through a delusion of annihilation aimed primarily at a state, the state of the Jews, fantasized as a Jew among states, so the total process Hilberg spoke of, namely that the machinery necessary for annihilation could not be fundamentally distinguished from the German social fabric as a whole, Hilberg's view of the total process, namely that the machinery that was necessary for the destruction could not be fundamentally distinguished from the German social fabric as a whole, is to be understood in a different way insofar as the 'machinery' in which the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Al-Qaeda and IS in Syria and Iraq, i.e. a multiplicity of jihadists on the borders of Israel, and the \"dual state\" of the Iranian regime work together, can no longer be distinguished from a religious fabric as a whole. Of course, this is no less a social phenomenon, insofar as all religion can only be understood as social, but part of the specificity of this phenomenon is that the clergy as well as the believers here successfully refuse from the outset to constitutionally and definitively separate politics and religion, public and private, as the sphere of circulation and the rule of law provide. Like National Socialism, Jihad no longer needs to hatch its own 'political religion', consciously deviating from the traditional Christian churches, in order to leave behind, both internally and externally, the boundaries of the state's form of rule, as they characterize the nation in its classical Western form.

To follow this primacy means nothing else than the interpretation and implementation of the practical imperative after Auschwitz; it is the mode of taking sides with the state of the Jews. This does not only mean to take it into account, for example, with regard to the assessment of the different political forces within Israel, depending on their foreign policy conceptions, but it means above all to judge each state according to its relationship to Israel and - in accordance with Israel's role for all Jews - to the Jews in its own country, especially when the conflicts escalate. In this context, primacy implies, first of all, countering in the most comprehensive way possible the phantasmagorias that are more than ever associated with international law. And here the legacy of Hobbes, in whom Leo Strauss recognized precisely that primacy (and against whom Carl Schmitt set his Großraumtheorie and his concept of nomos), gains immediate topical significance. For the idea that there would be a world domestic policy in which all foreign policy would merge, in which the relations of violence between states would be transformed into relations between peaceful democratic parties, i.e. peoples, has meanwhile become a fixed idea of the public sphere, especially of the European one. This development is exactly opposite to the earlier one of critical theory: its blind spot was not only not dissolved, but solemnly declared to be the central perspective. It is no coincidence, then, that that young assistant at the Institute for Social Research, whom Horkheimer once distrusted the most, now emerges as one of the leading European ideologists. The ghost speech that Jürgen Habermas is leading and on the content of which today all political commitment - from 'radical left' anti-imperialists to neo-Nazi big-space theorists - has sworn itself in, is based on the poisoned utopia that law could be asserted internationally in the same way as within a state - as if instead of the world revolution a single constitutional state could be established. The phantasmatic nature of this idea, in which the theories of Adorno laureates excel today, is already exposed by the simple realization that there is and can be no monopoly of force outside the states, which would guarantee the execution of this right. Between the states, each of which possesses the monopoly of force on their territories, the stronger among them is able to emerge temporarily as hegemon - like the USA in the western world, namely by the victory over National Socialist Germany -, but it can by no means rule over them as a sovereign. (Even within the Eurozone, today's Germany can only act as a hegemon in relation to the other states, although their sovereignty has been cut back considerably - admittedly also that of Germany, so that this state must partly 'play through the ranks' here: exercise its hegemonic power via the Brussels institutions).

As a system of conventions it is of no small importance, and it is not at all a question of denying this importance in general, since it offers in principle certain formal possibilities to settle conflicts peacefully or to steer them into more reasonable paths - but only if the balance of power between the states allows it, for instance if a hegemon or a hegemonic alliance is committed to its enforcement in a certain case.

Under the hegemony of the victorious powers of the First World War, the illusory trust in the League of Nations arose, counting on this international institution to prevent another world war. And it was probably connected with the blind spot of Critical Theory, with its concept of state capitalism, that it was so incapable of exposing this illusory trust as the mode of action of appeasement - the criticism of the behavior of the Jews, which Horkheimer made in the essay on The Jews and Europe, could even be interpreted as a substitute action for this urgent imperative."

However, such pacification is only possible in the long term within the state if a recognized monopoly on the use of force guarantees that the treaties between the citizens are valid: in this way, the citizens are able to refrain from the direct use of force in their relations. To demand this pacification between the states, on the other hand, proves to be a \"pious wish\" (Kant) in a very specific, structural sense, since the observance of the conventions and treaties depends solely on the currently prevailing balance of power among the individual states. The illusion, however, arises again and again from the need to deceive oneself about the fact that the form of the state itself, which makes pacification possible on the inside, has this latent state of war on the outside as its condition."

Appeasement is therefore the epitome of political engagement. By ignoring the essence of the state, one repeats in ideology what the unstate does in practice and promotes, knowingly or unknowingly, the disintegration of society and the state into rackets - which already includes giving international institutions, which by their very nature are all based on agreements between states, more importance than they can have."

For Israel's sovereignty means at the same time more than mere sovereignty, just as the loss of independence here means annihilation: its Law of Return of 1950 is directed at the emergency for every Jew, and that means not least: at the fact that even the really valid law within the other constitutional states can by no means adequately protect against worldwide anti-Semitism - even if these in crisis and state of emergency should not deprive their much-cited 'Jewish fellow citizens' of their civic rights. Unlike Israel, they do not have a special immigration law for all Jews. The special mention of the Jewish fellow citizens has become a common attitude in the constitutional state after the Shoah, but nothing has changed in their legal status in and between the states, nothing can change according to the general constitution of state rule and civil society - nothing except that now a separate, Jewish state exists with that special immigration right for all those affected by anti-Semitism. And this exposes every anti-Zionist ideology: it wants Jews to be as defenseless as the people in the kosher supermarket in Paris were in front of the assassin's rifle on January 9, 2015."

Metaphysics means, not least, that the subject matter itself does not at all develop like a mere (natural) scientific problem, but rather in the reflection on how to think and act (possible) at all, which precedes the sciences. In other words: The appeal to the Jews, which Horkheimer wrote down in 1939, believed himself to be further secured by Marx's categorical imperative as far as the existential judgment on society was concerned; he did not yet know anything about it, nor could he have known that the reality of National Socialism would force a new one and thus metaphysical questions would return, which seemed to have been buried long ago with Hegel's Weltgeist, i.e.: resolved materialistically with Marx's critique of political economy. It is hardly by chance that the categorical imperative after Auschwitz should then find itself formulated in the part of the Negative Dialectic that bears the title \"Meditations on Metaphysics\"."

But derivation and reduction are now in a changed context. The perspective on the possible abolition of domination and violence can in principle no longer be separated from the struggle against the anti-Semitic delusion. When Adorno and Horkheimer write that the \"turnaround\" depends on \"whether the ruled become powerful in the face of absolute madness and put a stop to it, \"9 the ruled are no longer thought of only as a class or classes, but at the same time as individuals; the derivation is broken at a certain point and the functioning is viewed from the individuals, who can no longer be denied responsibility for it. In the face of that madness that has become abso- lute, critical theory itself has regained its concept of totality, which goes beyond mere sociological attribution and class affiliation, just as in the future no reflection on the abolition of domination will be possible for it without at the same time reflecting on the possible threat to the Jews."

        "text": "But the fact that for Critical Theory itself something like a practical field outside the directly Zionist objective and even before the founding of the Jewish state could come into view was only possible because the Western appeasement was now no longer continued, whatever the reasons underlying the new policy - and it was probably least of all the motive to prevent the extermination of the Jews themselves. In this respect, Horkheimer was hardly under any illusions throughout his life: \"Industrially advanced ... States, not to mention Stalinist Russia, did not wage war on Germany because of Hitler's terror, which they regarded as an internal affair, but for motives of power politics. \"13 But since the beginning of the war he felt compelled to distinguish between the powers in detail, depending on whether they practiced the terror themselves or not, and which of them - for reasons that were not of interest at first - could rather help to push it back. The powerlessness in the face of the impossibility to participate in a revolutionary action against any power politics was confronted with the compulsion for a practical solution in the defense against the worst - in this constellation only the 'metaphysical' foundations of the anti-Semitic madness and at the same time its own preconditions, the condition of the possibility of critique, were revealed to critical theory. Because it was recognized that such a solution was absolutely necessary, which was therefore no longer an aiming at merely supposed practice, something of these preconditions could emerge that had previously remained unexplained. To search for it without affirming this practice as legitimation of the existing is freely possible only if critique continues to \"relinquish the prejudice\" that \"some moment of the existing material reality is directly the positive\".14 It is precisely a matter of defending the presuppositions of critique, which cannot directly be the positive and must not be hypostatized as a positive standpoint, solely for the sake of the indirect possibility of critique, which, however, now coincides with the indirect defense against the politics of annihilation. Here, the experience of powerlessness may occur again and again with necessity: this experience guarantees that there is no such positive thing. If Horkheimer had once formulated that \"the totalitarian order is nothing else\" than \"its predecessor, which has lost its inhibitions, \"15 then he now recognizes that it is these inhibitions that can be important and names them, for example, as the \"power of resistance\" of law.16 He thus retrospectively agrees with those who have been criticized for their powerlessness. He thus retrospectively agrees with those whom he had so sharply criticized in The Jews and Europe, because they trusted that \"somewhere the reformation of Western capitalism is taking place more smoothly than that of German capitalism and that well-recommended foreigners still have a future\".17 Where this is really the case, where the power of resistance of law is still effective, is now unexpectedly part of the task of critical theory.

Whatever was set in motion in the states as a reaction to the world economic crisis was to be brought to a common denominator in it, whereby some essential provisions of Marx's critique had to lose their immediate validity. One consequence of this was that at the Institute for Social Research the view actually prevailed that the international solidarity of the capitalist classes made war improbable18 - as if state capitalism, which prevailed over all, would already produce a globally ruling sovereign under whose wing the capitalists could, as it were, be unrestrainedly solida- ric among themselves; As if the war between the states, possible at any time, were not the essence of the state and therein the indispensable guarantor that in the states themselves accumulation in the capitalist mode can take place at all."

Students of Carl Schmitt, who understood how to turn doctrine against the teacher, who made their disappointment with Schmitt's behavior after 1933 productive in a radical critique of the latter's concept of the political, provided the essential impetus here to expose the blind spot in the talk of state capitalism and at the same time to relate Marx's concept of crisis to the state in a new way: Otto Kirchheimer and Franz Neumann."

He took it up and radicalized it: Ultimately, it was questionable whether a formally or functionally uniform sovereign political power still existed in Germany at all. Accordingly, National Socialism should be understood not only as the abolition of the rule of law, but as a process in which its condition, the unified sovereign power, dissolves. Neumann spoke of the \"extreme formlessness\" to which this state was drifting, which as a result could no longer be called a state at all. Accordingly, one should rather speak of \"gangs\" - or to use Horkheimer's term: of \"rackets\" - whose leaders are constantly forced to get along again after disputes. In this respect, National Socialism no longer possesses a unified apparatus of coercion; it disintegrates into several political powers - Ernst Fraenkel had already characterized it in precisely this sense as a \"double state \"20 - which strike all the more brutally because their relations are not institutionalized, but are merely carried out personally. This personal unification, which is to be established ad hoc, can no longer be considered a unity in the sense of a state system, whether democracy or dictatorship: National Socialism, according to Neumann, was a non-state, an anarchy and a chaos."

If, on the other hand, the inner contradictions, which in the history of Critical Theory showed themselves in the critique of the state and anti-Semitism, are not unfolded, if concepts such as that of the administered world are rather used to camouflage them, then the possibility is also lost of still \"empowering\" its experience in the sense of Walter Benjamin's thesis: how it \"flashes up in the moment of danger\". Flashing here means that always only the most abstract point of contact is to be fixed, the current threat is directly considered against the background of what Neumann once called Behemoth. But it is precisely the most abstract that proves to be immensely effective for the concrete analysis: on the one hand, the determination that society disintegrates into bands in the crisis and that, precisely in this, mediation through the spheres of circulation and law is eliminated, the rackets thus becoming the predominant form of the political; on the other hand, that unity in this disintegration in society and in the consciousness of it is only established through the imagination of a Jewish world conspiracy, in which mediation and circulation return distorted into a delusion."

Above all, it also concerns the ideological shape of the world conspiracy itself: Just as unity is established through a delusion of annihilation aimed primarily at a state, the state of the Jews, fantasized as a Jew among states, so the total process Hilberg spoke of, namely that the machinery necessary for annihilation could not be fundamentally distinguished from the German social fabric as a whole, Hilberg's view of the total process, namely that the machinery that was necessary for the destruction could not be fundamentally distinguished from the German social fabric as a whole, is to be understood in a different way insofar as the 'machinery' in which the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Al-Qaeda and IS in Syria and Iraq, i.e. a multiplicity of jihadists on the borders of Israel, and the \"dual state\" of the Iranian regime work together, can no longer be distinguished from a religious fabric as a whole. Of course, this is no less a social phenomenon, insofar as all religion can only be understood as social, but part of the specificity of this phenomenon is that the clergy as well as the believers here successfully refuse from the outset to constitutionally and definitively separate politics and religion, public and private, as the sphere of circulation and the rule of law provide. Like National Socialism, Jihad no longer needs to hatch its own 'political religion', consciously deviating from the traditional Christian churches, in order to leave behind, both internally and externally, the boundaries of the state's form of rule, as they characterize the nation in its classical Western form.

        "text": "Of course, in the present conditions of the Middle East, where the danger is greatest that this imagination will be put into practice as the annihilation of the Jews, everything appears different at the same time. This concerns not only the possibilities of the rackets to make booty in the dissolution of circulation mechanisms and their relation to the world market and their position on it: they take on extremely diffe- rent forms in today's importance of oil production for the economy, depending on their respective starting position, which were unthinkable on the basis of the industrially highly developed and unified production in the Germany of the 1930s. Above all, it also concerns the ideological shape of the world conspiracy itself: Just as unity is established through a delusion of annihilation aimed primarily at a state, the state of the Jews, fantasized as a Jew among states, so the total process Hilberg spoke of, namely that the machinery necessary for annihilation could not be fundamentally distinguished from the German social fabric as a whole, Hilberg's view of the total process, namely that the machinery that was necessary for the destruction could not be fundamentally distinguished from the German social fabric as a whole, is to be understood in a different way insofar as the 'machinery' in which the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Al-Qaeda and IS in Syria and Iraq, i.e. a multiplicity of jihadists on the borders of Israel, and the \"dual state\" of the Iranian regime work together, can no longer be distinguished from a religious fabric as a whole. Of course, this is no less a social phenomenon, insofar as all religion can only be understood as social, but part of the specificity of this phenomenon is that the clergy as well as the believers here successfully refuse from the outset to constitutionally and definitively separate politics and religion, public and private, as the sphere of circulation and the rule of law provide. Like National Socialism, Jihad no longer needs to hatch its own 'political religion', consciously deviating from the traditional Christian churches, in order to leave behind, both internally and externally, the boundaries of the state's form of rule, as they characterize the nation in its classical Western form.

Nevertheless, their rivalry is not fought out in armed forms, such as that between IS and Al-Qaeda in the 'civil wars' in Syria or Iraq. For there exists a 'spiritual leader', as the sole authority in supreme command - like Hitler in his day; and this leader is, in turn, only the 'positive' expression of having succeeded in imposing the primacy of annihilation to the extent that all rival rackets can be inte- grated and refrain from settling their conflicts by force. The priority of annihilation is aimed at Israel, and it is only in this way that the nuclear program has today acquired fundamental importance for the entire regime of the Islamic Republic - and also gives the Revolutionary Guards, again similar to the SS, a privileged role in the midst of the rival rackets, since, on the one hand, they are closest to the spiritual leader for whom they were created, and, on the other hand, they have the greatest importance for the finalization of the nuclear program, especially with regard to its military dimension. For in this program lies the potential to build the bomb with which the destruction of Israel, openly demanded by the regime since time immemorial, can be put into practice in the simplest way and beyond the Sunni and Shiite rackets of the Middle East fighting each other with extreme brutality."

To follow this primacy means nothing else than the interpretation and implementation of the practical imperative after Auschwitz; it is the mode of taking sides with the state of the Jews. This does not only mean to take it into account, for example, with regard to the assessment of the different political forces within Israel, depending on their foreign policy conceptions, but it means above all to judge each state according to its relationship to Israel and - in accordance with Israel's role for all Jews - to the Jews in its own country, especially when the conflicts escalate. In this context, primacy implies, first of all, countering in the most comprehensive way possible the phantasmagorias that are more than ever associated with international law. And here the legacy of Hobbes, in whom Leo Strauss recognized precisely that primacy (and against whom Carl Schmitt set his Großraumtheorie and his concept of nomos), gains immediate topical significance. For the idea that there would be a world domestic policy in which all foreign policy would merge, in which the relations of violence between states would be transformed into relations between peaceful democratic parties, i.e. peoples, has meanwhile become a fixed idea of the public sphere, especially of the European one. This development is exactly opposite to the earlier one of critical theory: its blind spot was not only not dissolved, but solemnly declared to be the central perspective. It is no coincidence, then, that that young assistant at the Institute for Social Research, whom Horkheimer once distrusted the most, now emerges as one of the leading European ideologists. The ghost speech that Jürgen Habermas is leading and on the content of which today all political commitment - from 'radical left' anti-imperialists to neo-Nazi big-space theorists - has sworn itself in, is based on the poisoned utopia that law could be asserted internationally in the same way as within a state - as if instead of the world revolution a single constitutional state could be established. The phantasmatic nature of this idea, in which the theories of Adorno laureates excel today, is already exposed by the simple realization that there is and can be no monopoly of force outside the states, which would guarantee the execution of this right. Between the states, each of which possesses the monopoly of force on their territories, the stronger among them is able to emerge temporarily as hegemon - like the USA in the western world, namely by the victory over National Socialist Germany -, but it can by no means rule over them as a sovereign. (Even within the Eurozone, today's Germany can only act as a hegemon in relation to the other states, although their sovereignty has been cut back considerably - admittedly also that of Germany, so that this state must partly 'play through the ranks' here: exercise its hegemonic power via the Brussels institutions).

This law consists ultimately of agreements and alliances, it is not a law covered by a superior and adequately armed power. As a system of conventions it is of no small importance, and it is not at all a question of denying this importance in general, since it offers in principle certain formal possibilities to settle conflicts peacefully or to steer them into more reasonable paths - but only if the balance of power between the states allows it, for instance if a hegemon or a hegemonic alliance is committed to its enforcement in a certain case. If this is the case, however, illusions are usually not far away, which place more trust in conventions than they deserve. Under the hegemony of the victorious powers of the First World War, the illusory trust in the League of Nations arose, counting on this international institution to prevent another world war. And it was probably connected with the blind spot of Critical Theory, with its concept of state capitalism, that it was so incapable of exposing this illusory trust as the mode of action of appeasement - the criticism of the behavior of the Jews, which Horkheimer made in the essay on The Jews and Europe, could even be interpreted as a substitute action for this urgent imperative."

Unlike Israel, they do not have a special immigration law for all Jews. The special mention of the Jewish fellow citizens has become a common attitude in the constitutional state after the Shoah, but nothing has changed in their legal status in and between the states, nothing can change according to the general constitution of state rule and civil society - nothing except that now a separate, Jewish state exists with that special immigration right for all those affected by anti-Semitism. And this exposes every anti-Zionist ideology: it wants Jews to be as defenseless as the people in the kosher supermarket in Paris were in front of the assassin's rifle on January 9, 2015."
