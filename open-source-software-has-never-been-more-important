      "text": "GitHub's Octoverse 2022 report on the state of open-source software found that 90% of Fortune 100 companies use open-source software (OSS) in some capacity. There have been 413 million OSS contributions to GitHub from the platform's 94 million users this year alone, the company noted. The report found that commercially backed OSS projects are increasing, and that around a third of Fortune 100 companies now have an open-source program office to coordinate their OSS strategies. However, as the Synopsis Open-Source Security and Risk Analysis Report for 2022 found, despite a steady 3% year-on-year decrease in vulnerabilities, more than 80% of the codebases analyzed were still found with at least one vulnerability, with 88% of the codebases investigated showing no signs of update in the past two years."
