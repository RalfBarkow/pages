If you identify natural strata in the domain, cast them as broad abstract responsibilities. These responsibilities should tell a story of the high-level purpose and design of your system. Refactor the model so that the responsibilities of each domain object, [[aggregates]] and [[modules]] fit neatly within the responsibility of one layer."
