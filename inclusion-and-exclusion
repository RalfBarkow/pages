Communication, however, which treats its behavior as communication, assumes self-reference in the sense of an 'as if' and then runs into the difficulty of this very counterfactuality: it cannot fulfill its function of error correction without great effort. Or in other words: difficulties of understanding occur continuously, which cannot be solved by the common techniques of confirmation, of the accompanying mental and communicative control of understanding or even by metacommunication. The possible structure of communication is characterized by one-sided consciousness in the environment of a non-conscious address. Or still differently: In view of the addressability of the infant, communication gets into a permanent crisis. It is neither certain whether something has been communicated, nor whether messages have been understood. The connections shift, as it were, into the blue. The interesting thing is that this very uncertainty leads to a process in the course of which the child (as in a self-fulfilling prophecy) gains an address and with it the possibility of establishing self-reference. The crisis, this would mean, is the instrument of its solution. It leads first of all to a difference of the 'volumes' of communication."

Amplificatio as a technique belongs to the quantity figures. It is used to achieve evidence. Amplification is thus not a figure of brevitas, brevity, or economy. Contrary to what modern notions of evidence suggest, amplifying speech/writing is not about achieving a striking intuition in the shortest possible way, but rather about achieving the most vivid understanding possible. In this respect the procedure is uneconomical, because it presupposes the multiplication (augmentation) of differences. Instead, redundancies are unfolded in a precise sense and with a clear reference to perception (ad oculos ponere), i.e. to e-vidence. The procedure presupposes imagination in the addressee and differs in this from all techniques that fulfill decorative functions or appeal to the intellect. In short: amplification differentiates differences."

The very fact that the child represents a kind of institutionalized permanent crisis forces communication into the procedures of augmentation/amplification of itself. Since this, so to speak, jumping-up communication assumes self-reference in the addressee and gains its volume from this assumption, it inevitably comes to a clear marking of the self-referential component of communication. It emphasizes the communication aspect, it reduces the information aspect. In this respect, communication with the small child becomes 'repressed', that is, endowed with strongly emphatic moments (with emotional overtones). It stamps, so to speak, again and again with one foot of its self-reference and thus chants a beat which (however then in detail) replaces the imputation of self-reference in the system of the beginning by factual self-reference, i.e. by a gradually expressing self-relation of the incessantly addressed system of the beginning. This shaping, however, is exclusion, insofar as on this elementary level is separated what comes into question as address, and at the same time elementary inclusion, because uno actu the possibility of participation in communication arises: the address."

This could justify drawing on sociological knowledge about the forms of intimacy, about the specificity of early inclusion/exclusion processes, but also knowledge about conformist and deviant address formation. Furthermore, it could be shown how the first address is gradually pulled out of the context of total inclusion in the family and included in ever new contexts, with correspondingly ever new processes of exclusion. It could be observed how the problem of having to be an address leads to the problem of 'recognition' in the psychic environment of address formation, i.e. to the fact that individuals spend their whole lives trying to be addressable and to avoid losing addressability. Even the assertion that recognition is unimportant to one is still in the service of trying to specify one's address as a superior one. The loss of addressability in a majority of socially relevant social contexts conjures up the danger of total exclusion, and it is now apparent that large social systems have set out to restore addressability. All this leads to unforeseeable horizons of reorganization of known research stocks or the establishment of new heuristics."

In Buddhism, to give another example, in the great circle of rebirth the same address is endowed with the potential of total oblivion of previous states of being. It is the same and not the same. But also here the attainment of the sufferinglessness is bound to life guidance cuts, thus to strategies of immanent address formation of a certain kind."

We could speak of a sharply limited address with regard to possibilities of connection beyond the stratum boundary, which at the same time places possible communication within the stratum under equally sharply restrictive conditions. The stratum address largely determines which opportunities for happiness and suffering are accessible to the addressed individual and which are definitely not. This 'dense' address (as much as we retrospectively characterize it as restrictive) has a high orientational value, which allows to behave appropriately and to discriminate inappropriateness in almost all life cases. Inappropriate behavior is under the threat of exclusion, which, in relation to the stratum, can be total exclusion, in relation to society culminates in the elimination of the body, in the erasure of the immanent (not the transcendent) address."
