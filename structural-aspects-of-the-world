Once a decision is made, to find methods in software and in computer science, which go toward solving [[Bill Joy]]’s program, it is certain that these methods will bring with them, changes in computer science itself, in the structure of programs: and will ultimately cause a revolution in structure of programs which might be compared, for example, to the jump in structure that occurred when McCarthy went from SAP, other machine languages, and FORTRAN-like languages, to LISP, lisp was based on a radically different and more profound conception of structure. These next jumps and changes will be bigger. Very deep changes in structure can be expected, when one begins to write programs that have to do with centers, with wholeness, and with structure preserving transformations, and these changes will not be restricted to the computer screen."

What is quite certain, in my view, is that implementation of Bill Joy’s program, and solution of his requirements, cannot be confined to the user-interface, and will require changes in the deep structure of programs, too. The childish and more intuitive forms of expression and use, which come closer to experienced human reality, and which Bill Joy is looking for, will – ultimately – require comparable changes in the structure of the programs that are used to write them. Early versions of the new wholeness seeking software which we aim for, can be written in contemporary code. However, I think it likely, and perhaps inevitable, that a new generation of languages and development principles based on centers as key structural concept will make c++, in retrospect, look as crude as fortran looks to us today."

        "text": "The issues which have driven the [[Gatemaker]] pilot, are matters of feeling and human spirit. The four volumes of [[The Nature of Order]], establish, at several different levels, the fact that issues of feeling and human spirit, are connected to profound and definable structural aspects of the world. This touches the sphere of buildings, of course. But it goes very much deeper than that. [https://www.gregbryant.com/gatemaker page] "

        "text": "These structural issues (concerning centers, structure-preserving transformations, and so forth) will inevitably affect deep structure of programs, too, because they affect the deep structure of everything. Once a decision is made, to find methods in software and in computer science, which go toward solving [[Bill Joy]]’s program, it is certain that these methods will bring with them, changes in computer science itself, in the structure of programs: and will ultimately cause a revolution in structure of programs which might be compared, for example, to the jump in structure that occurred when McCarthy went from SAP, other machine languages, and FORTRAN-like languages, to LISP, lisp was based on a radically different and more profound conception of structure. These next jumps and changes will be bigger. Very deep changes in structure can be expected, when one begins to write programs that have to do with centers, with wholeness, and with structure preserving transformations, and these changes will not be restricted to the computer screen."
