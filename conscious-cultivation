      "text": "Five weeks into her appointment, when the physical school yard was still a construction site with incomplete shells of buildings, Vicki held the very first community consultation, gathering an impressive crowd of 160 foundation community members. The foundation Griffin parent community spoke of their dreams for their children and shared their hopes for the school experience. They communicated what they envisioned as the enduring effects of seven years of education. Yes, they articulated competence, but they also boldly paired it with character. Competence AND character. The essence of the Griffin vision emerged from the community it was to serve. In an embryonic community, a developing suburb, Vicki began consciously cultivating culture. And 'the feeling' began to surface. "

      "text": "Over the weeks and months ahead, as the planning group, staff from Education Queensland and the construction company built the school’s foundations, the Griffin community built foundations of their own, cultural foundations. They invested themselves in making collaborative decisions, every choice a shared one and every voice heard, each time. Many hands made light work, relationships formed, and a collective ownership materialised. Today, community involvement and consultation continues to be sought and valued, forming an important part of what is known as [[The Griffin Way]]. Our parent community is engaged, eager and hands-on because they feel that they are valued partners. We don’t just say it, we show it."

      "text": "Much like building foundational relationships with families, gathering the first staff group together was another conscious cultivation exercise for Vicki. Retreating to the Sunshine Coast for a long weekend, the foundation staff team set about forming deep bonds and developing a collective vision. In order to build trust quickly and connect peer to purpose, Vicki asked us to share two artefacts, objects that spoke about us as individuals, personally and professionally. Undertaking this exercise saw many of our newly-connected team willing to become comfortable talking about their vulnerabilities honestly and with raw emotion. A very simple exercise that saw a culture of authentic voice, deep listening and relationships established. Each individual seen and heard, each individual’s potential illuminated. Belonging was valued over fitting in from the very beginning. "

Instead of spending hours of our initial time together selecting banal programs and resources and rehashing mediocre visions and mottos, we pondered. Grounding us in our why and allowing us to begin to consider and create our culture were some carefully selected inspirations: The book Vicki had given us during recruitment, _Educating Ruby_ by Guy Claxton; _Every Kid Needs a Champion_, a Ted Talk by Rita Pearson; and _Little Jimmy_, a You Tube clip by the talented nephew of Vicki’s friend and colleague, Bronwyn Braithwaite."

Wandering into the depths of the old story of school, our personal experiences and our collective frustrations with the educational experience, we began to co-author the story of Griffin, a new narrative yet to be fully realised. We didn’t know it at the time, but through our discussions we were naming the culture that we would go on to collaboratively create. Emerging from our retreat, the foundation Griffin teaching team was united in our vision. We each committed to becoming [[Super Teachers]]. "

Never before had we been asked to connect so deeply to our past experiences in order to envision a new story. Never before were our voices so valued in our system. Here we were boldly sharing our dreams as we established the school we wanted, maybe the school we all wished we'd had. "

Voices are valued, artefacts are shared, consultation is sought, trust is established and relationships are built first. These practices have become embedded traditions. In much the same way, other culture cultivation processes have become almost innate practices at Griffin. They keep our culture alive; continual conscious cultivation keeps Griffin alive."

The foundation Griffin parent community spoke of their dreams for their children and shared their hopes for the school experience. They communicated what they envisioned as the enduring effects of seven years of education. Yes, they articulated competence, but they also boldly paired it with character. Competence AND character. The Griffin vision began to emerge from the community it was to serve. In an embryonic community, a developing suburb, Vicki began consciously cultivating culture."

They invested themselves in making collaborative decisions, every choice a shared one and every voice heard, each time. Many hands made light work, relationships formed, and a collective ownership materialised. Today, community involvement and consultation continues to be sought and valued, forming an important part of what is known as [[The Griffin Way]]. Our parent community is engaged, eager and hands-on because they feel that they are valued partners. We don’t just say it, we show it."

Retreating to the Sunshine Coast for a long weekend, the foundation staff team set about forming deep bonds and developing a collective vision. In order to build trust quickly and connect peer to purpose, Vicki asked us to share two artefacts, objects that spoke about us as individuals, personally and professionally. Undertaking this exercise saw many of our newly-connected team willing to become comfortable talking about their vulnerabilities honestly and with raw emotion. A very simple exercise that saw a culture of authentic voice, deep listening and relationships established. Each individual seen and heard, each individual’s potential illuminated. "

We didn’t know it at the time, but through our discussions we were naming the culture that we would go on to collaboratively create at Griffin. Emerging from our retreat, the foundation Griffin teaching team was united in our vision. We each committed to becoming a [[Super Teacher]]. "

In much the same way, other culture cultivation processes have become almost innate practices at Griffin. They keep our culture alive; continual conscious cultivation keeps Griffin alive."

Retreating to the Sunshine Coast for a long weekend, the foundation staff team set about forming deep bonds and developing a collective vision. In order to build trust quickly and connect peer to purpose, Vicki asked us to share two artefacts, objects that spoke about us as individuals, personally and professionally. Undertaking this exercise saw many of our newly-connected team willing to become comfortable talking about their vulnerabilities honestly and with raw emotion. A very simple exercise that saw a culture of authentic voice, deep listening and relationships established. Each individual seen and heard, each individual’s potential illuminated. Belonging was valued over fitting in from the very beginning. "
