      "text": "# Advice from Andy Louden a firefighter in Oregon \n\nI’m a firefighter in Oregon and do structure protection at Wildland fires much of the summer. Your assessment and advice is pretty darn good. I’d like to add a few points. Most importantly is to understand that most homes catch fire not due to radiant heat from the trees on fire but rather ember storms driven by the winds. The embers collect just as leaves or snow drift and ignite combustibles they collect up against, like the bottom edge of the plywood sheathing under a roof or siding and the surface of a wooden deck. Knowing that, there are a few steps that are very effective:\n\n1) cleaning your roof and gutters of combustible materials. Plugging the down spouts (I like disposable diapers as the swell and make a tight seal) and filling the gutters with water. "
