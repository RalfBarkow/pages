However, even with only one firm, competitive pricing is achievable if: (1) prospective entrants are assured of entry free of barriers and the ability to recoup entry costs upon later exit; and (2) the incumbent firm is induced by threat of entry to charge sustainable prices such that no profitable entrepreneurial entry is possible. But regulation is thought to necessary if (a) subadditivity holds but no sustainable prices exist to forestall entry or (b) the market is uncontested because of entry barriers and unrecoverable entry costs. However, in both cases, regulatory responses are critically reliant on opportunity costs being objective and measurable. But opportunity costs are only objective in a static equilibrium devoid of uncertainty, economic change and genuine entrepreneurial activity. Hence, the policies aimed at increasing economic efficiency are necessarily empty and irrelevant."
