Referring back to the list of counter examples above, I think Scale and Geographic Distribution are the only two that some form of ownership actually has any bearing on success (I have to admit I really didn't get the Market Structure example, so I can't argue either way on that). However, I would also contend that within each sub-team or local group that [[Collective Code Ownership]] be practiced. What this implies is that the project be split along non-overlapping segments, which I realize is not always possible, and for anything that reaches over to the other realm, a meeting of the minds does need to take place.

Most of the time, particularly in small and medium-sized projects, they agree that one person has final say-so over a range of classes, but others have editing rights, and they should either sign and date, or send the owner an email, so she/he can look over the changes.

The other one that could be expected to fail, is if there is bad blood between developers and they have established full joint ownership. I have heard tell of such things happening on projects in which joint ownership was not officially established, but they just didn't have any ownership mechanism in place.

But with [[Pair Programming]], the core knowledge of each area of expertise is continually disseminated throughout the team as time goes on, and the [[Unit Test]] suite makes sure that whatever is undertaken doesn't break anything. I think most of what is being discussed here has more to do with effective communication of design decisions than who actually \"owns\" the code. Referring back to the list of counter examples above, I think Scale and Geographic Distribution are the only two that some form of ownership actually has any bearing on success (I have to admit I really didn't get the Market Structure example, so I can't argue either way on that). However, I would also contend that within each sub-team or local group that [[Collective Code Ownership]] be practiced. What this implies is that the project be split along non-overlapping segments, which I realize is not always possible, and for anything that reaches over to the other realm, a meeting of the minds does need to take place. What the [[Code Ownership]] accomplishes, then, is setting constraints on a project.

For Bleeding Edge technology you never have \"sorcerers' apprentices just turned loose\" because you would pair them properly and also have a [[Unit Test]]s to protect the innocent. Lastly, with the dissemination of knowledge mentioned above, [[Refactor Mercilessly]], and doing [[Extreme Programming Design Reviews]] when necessary, reuse is utilized throughout the project.
