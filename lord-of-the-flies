On a Thursday, I noticed that my team had just about had it, the project deadline was the following Friday and we had three more days worth of work to do on it before completion. We knew we should finish ahead of schedule, be we were all just about brain fried (read burned-out). So what I did was to declare a three-day weekend: We not only left work early that Thursday, but we were going to ignore the project entirely until the next Monday. This was probably one of the smartest moves I have ever made as we had one of the most productive days we had ever had. We completed the project Tuesday afternoon. If we hadn't taken the time off, I believe that we still would have delivered on time (it was a matter of pride to my team that we had not missed a deadline) but it would have been much more difficult.

So what I did was to declare a three-day weekend: We not only left work early that Thursday, but we were going to ignore the project entirely until the next Monday.
