As the size and complexity of a network of interest increases (beyond that of a manageably small size of at most, say, a few dozen nodes that can all be easily visualized at once), there is a growing need to develop algorithms to graphically render the structure of complex networks. Novel graph visualization techniques have recently been developed that facilitate the visualization of multidimensional feature spaces and the mapping of conceptual spaces into physical space."
