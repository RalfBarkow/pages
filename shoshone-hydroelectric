This predates rights owned by entities on Colorado's Front Range, which draw water from where most of the state's precipitation falls on the Western Slope across the Continental Divide to major population centers east of the Rocky Mountains. By ensuring a consistent flow of water downstream on the river, Shoshone supports diverse sectors of the Western Slope economy, including river recreation, agriculture, and public utility use."
