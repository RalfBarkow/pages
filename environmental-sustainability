By focusing on organizational members as catalysts of change, organizational learning is described as an experience-driven change process in the organizational knowledge base (Argote & Miron-Spektor, 2011). Through the lens of organizational learning, our research question is as follows: How organizations internalize demands for ES, by looking at factors that promote (hinder) a substantive internalization of ES among organizational actors who do the “real work” (Cook & Brown, 1999, p. 387)."
