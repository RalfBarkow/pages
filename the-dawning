They discovered that these particles, the foundation of all matter, were somehow universally entangled in a way that was, perhaps, beyond our capacity to ever understand, emerging from a state of formless energy in moments of realization, quantum moments."

        "text": "In the latter part of his career, Whitehead sought to imagine a new way of thinking to explore these emerging quantum mysteries, one that cast off the linear logic that underpinned the [[Cartesian Mindset]]. To do so, he began to invent a new language of reality – an ontology – to help us into this unknown. It was in this aspiration he coined the term 'creativity'."

But few realized that this word was only recently coined – first used by the mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead. He originally penned it for a lecture he gave in 1926 and it first appeared in print a year later. "
