The idea is that we want something done that may take time (often io, an http request, writing to disk, getting something from the db, etc), and instead of waiting we want to continue on with what we were doing. To handle the results of that action we moved past, we call a callback function when the event loop is free."

This makes it easier to ignore the error condition, which is a common way to crash your program or leave it in a bad state."
