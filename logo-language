The TORTIS papers are about a big button box that let really young children control the turtle (including the ability to store procedures and a \"slot machine\" which the child programmed by putting cards representing actions into slots in a board!).  There are papers reporting on a test of Logo in a Brookline school with LSI-11's (microprocessor version of the PDP-11).  There's even a paper breaking down the art of juggling into \"procedures\" and explaining how to fix common \"bugs\".  Good stuff!",
