We expect our educators to batch children by age, implement a restrictive year level curriculum, constantly assess and grade, ultimately prepare children for high stakes tests, and to complete all the requisite mandatory training and paperwork the education system produces. We remain overly concerned about the deficits in children, teachers, and schools, and not concerned enough about the potential in learning."
