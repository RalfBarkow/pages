DOI 10.1613/jair.995. We consider the problem of designing the the utility    functions of the utility-maximizing agents in a multi-agent system so    that they work synergistically to maximize a global utility. The    particular problem domain we explore is the control of network routing    by placing agents on all the routers in the network.  Conventional    approaches to this task have the agents all use the Ideal Shortest    Path routing Algorithm (ISPA).  We demonstrate that in many cases, due    to the side-effects of one agent’s actions on another agent’s    performance, having agents use ISPA’s is suboptimal as far as global    aggregate cost is concerned, even when they are only used to route    infinitesimally small amounts of traffic.  The utility functions of    the individual agents are not ``aligned’’ with the global utility,    intuitively speaking.  As a particular example of this we present an    instance of Braess’ paradox in which adding new links to a network    whose agents all use the ISPA results in a decrease in overall    throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the    agents’ decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost    incurred by all traffic currently being routed, is suboptimal as far    as global cost averaged across time is concerned. This is also due to    `side-effects’, in this case of current routing decision on future    traffic. The mathematics of Collective Intelligence (COIN) is    concerned precisely with the issue of avoiding such deleterious    side-effects in multi-agent systems, both over time and space. We    present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive an    algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that    of having all agents use the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We    present experiments verifying this, and also showing that a    machine-learning-based version of this COIN algorithm in which costs    are only imprecisely estimated via empirical means (a version    potentially applicable in the real world) also outperforms the ISPA,    despite having access to less information than does the ISPA. In    particular, this COIN algorithm almost always avoids Braess’ paradox.\n"

A COIN is a large multi-agent system where:\n\nThere is little to no centralized communication or control.\n\nThere is a provided world utility function that rates the possible histories of the full system.\n\nIn particular, we are interested in COINs in which each agent runs a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The conventional approach to designing large distributed systems to optimize a world utility does not use agents running RL algorithms. Rather, that approach begins with explicit modeling of the dynamics of the overall system, followed by detailed hand-tuning of the interactions between the components to ensure that they ``cooperate'' as far as the world utility is concerned. This approach is labor-intensive, often results in highly nonrobust systems, and usually results in design techniques that have limited applicability."

In other words, what reward functions will best ensure that we do not have phenomena like the tragedy of the commons, Braess's paradox, or the liquidity trap?"

DOI 10.1613/jair.995. We consider the problem of designing the the utility    functions of the utility-maximizing agents in a multi-agent system so    that they work synergistically to maximize a global utility. The    particular problem domain we explore is the control of network routing    by placing agents on all the routers in the network.  Conventional    approaches to this task have the agents all use the Ideal Shortest    Path routing Algorithm (ISPA).  We demonstrate that in many cases, due    to the side-effects of one agent’s actions on another agent’s    performance, having agents use ISPA’s is suboptimal as far as global    aggregate cost is concerned, even when they are only used to route    infinitesimally small amounts of traffic.  The utility functions of    the individual agents are not ``aligned’’ with the global utility,    intuitively speaking.  As a particular example of this we present an    instance of Braess’ paradox in which adding new links to a network    whose agents all use the ISPA results in a decrease in overall    throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the    agents’ decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost    incurred by all traffic currently being routed, is suboptimal as far    as global cost averaged across time is concerned. This is also due to    `side-effects’, in this case of current routing decision on future    traffic. The mathematics of Collective Intelligence (COIN) is    concerned precisely with the issue of avoiding such deleterious    side-effects in multi-agent systems, both over time and space. We    present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive an    algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that    of having all agents use the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We    present experiments verifying this, and also showing that a    machine-learning-based version of this COIN algorithm in which costs    are only imprecisely estimated via empirical means (a version    potentially applicable in the real world) also outperforms the ISPA,    despite having access to less information than does the ISPA. In    particular, this COIN algorithm almost always avoids Braess’ paradox.\n"

DOI 10.1613/jair.995. We consider the problem of designing the the utility    functions of the utility-maximizing agents in a multi-agent system so    that they work synergistically to maximize a global utility. The    particular problem domain we explore is the control of network routing    by placing agents on all the routers in the network.  Conventional    approaches to this task have the agents all use the Ideal Shortest    Path routing Algorithm (ISPA).  We demonstrate that in many cases, due    to the side-effects of one agent’s actions on another agent’s    performance, having agents use ISPA’s is suboptimal as far as global    aggregate cost is concerned, even when they are only used to route    infinitesimally small amounts of traffic.  The utility functions of    the individual agents are not ``aligned’’ with the global utility,    intuitively speaking.  As a particular example of this we present an    instance of Braess’ paradox in which adding new links to a network    whose agents all use the ISPA results in a decrease in overall    throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the    agents’ decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost    incurred by all traffic currently being routed, is suboptimal as far    as global cost averaged across time is concerned. This is also due to    `side-effects’, in this case of current routing decision on future    traffic. The mathematics of Collective Intelligence (COIN) is    concerned precisely with the issue of avoiding such deleterious    side-effects in multi-agent systems, both over time and space. We    present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive an    algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that    of having all agents use the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We    present experiments verifying this, and also showing that a    machine-learning-based version of this COIN algorithm in which costs    are only imprecisely estimated via empirical means (a version    potentially applicable in the real world) also outperforms the ISPA,    despite having access to less information than does the ISPA. In    particular, this COIN algorithm almost always avoids Braess’ paradox.\n"
