It covers pages 6-7 in today's National Edition, and has a front-page satellite image above the fold showing the Cathay Phoenix tanker docked at the Russian oil terminal in Kozmino, although its GPS showed it many miles southeast, near to the coast of Japan. Actually, the ship had left from China for a scheduled stop in South Korea, and then switched its GPS location to a spoofed fixed FAKE location near Niigata (Japan) while returning to Kozmino.  According to the article, three tankers tracked by *The NYTimes* from Kozmino had made 13 trips loading Russian oil and delivering it to China, each using GPS spoofing to mask their whereabouts."
