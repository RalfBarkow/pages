While reviewing literature for my dissertation, I encountered studies of the diffusion of kindergartens and of driver training among schools (Mort, 1953), as well as the spread of an antibiotic drug (tetracycline) among medical doctors (Menzel and Katz, 1955). The main findings were strikingly similar to the agricultural diffusion studies in which I was involved: an S-shaped rate of adoption over time, different sources or channels at different stages in the innovation-decision process for an individual, and a tendency for innovators (the first individuals in a system to adopt an innovation) to travel and read widely and to have a cosmopolite orientation. The review of literature chapter in my dissertation argued that diffusion was a general process, not bound by the type of innovation studied, who the adopters were, or by place or culture.
