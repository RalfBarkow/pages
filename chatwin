In the Footsteps of Bruce Chatwin\" takes the title of an older, two-part biopic by Paul Yule and Chatwin's biographer Nicholas Shakespeare and was shown on British television in September 2019. The planned theatrical release the following year fell victim to the pandemic, but now the film is available online, and with mobility and its limitations particularly in the spotlight now, this may be an opportune time to take a look at the filmmaker, the travel writer, and the driven nature that links the two."
