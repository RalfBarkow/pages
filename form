The depth of a Form is how many bits are used to specify the color at each pixel.  The actual bits are held in a Bitmap, whose internal structure is different at each depth.  Class Color allows you to deal with colors without knowing how they are actually encoded inside a Bitmap.\n\t  The supported depths (in bits) are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.  The number of actual colors at these depths are: 2, 4, 16, 256, 32768, and 16 million.\n\tForms are indexed starting at 0 instead of 1; thus, the top-left pixel of a Form has coordinates 0@0.\n\tForms are combined using [[BitBlt]].
