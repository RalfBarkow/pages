It is a very effective means of creating tests. It *does* require a real 'event' log rather than some kind of text file output. The event log has 32 event categories that can be filtered on. Further, two logs can be opened, two filters attached to them, and then the two filters can be compared for differences. Obviously, the event log is also central to the full-scale functionals.",

It is a very effective means of creating tests. It *does* require a real 'event' log rather than some kind of text file output. The event log has 32 event categories that can be filtered on. Further, two logs can be opened, two filters attached to them, and then the two filters can be compared for differences. Obviously, the event log is also central to the full-scale functionals.",
