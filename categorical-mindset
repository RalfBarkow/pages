Our goal for chapter 0 is to present what is perhaps familiar to you—functions, sets, topological spaces—from the contemporary perspective of category theory.

Motivated by a few key features of topological spaces and continuous functions, we’ll proceed to section 0.2 and introduce three basic concepts of category theory: categories, functors, and natural transformations. The same section highlights one of the main philosophies of category theory, namely that studying a mathematical object is akin to studying its relationships to other objects. This golden thread starts in section 0.2 and weaves its way through the remaining pages of the book—we encourage you to keep an eye out for the occasional glimmer. Finally, equipped with the [[categorical mindset]], we’ll revisit some familiar ideas from basic set theory in section 0.3."
