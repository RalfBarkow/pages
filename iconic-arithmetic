The sections on history, the imaginary J, applications of James algebra and non-numeric forms are relatively independent. The heart of arithmetic consists of three concepts: [[zero]], [[one]] and [[infinity]]. The heart of James algebra embraces three grounding concepts: the nonexistent void, the accumulator ( ) and the unifier [ ]. This volume begins with a resurrection of Euler’s work on the logarithms of negative numbers in the form of the numeric constant [<( )>], abbreviated as J. The first three chapters explore the history, behavior and issues associated with log –1 and its apparent neglect in modern arithmetic. The next three chapters examine the intimate relationship between π, i and J established by Euler. Then follows a collection of applications of postsymbolic formal thinking to selected subfields of elementary mathematics. If iconic arithmetic is more than an isomorphism, then its application should suggest entirely different perspectives on established mathematical systems. These four chapters are unabashedly exploratory, recounting experiments, dead ends and forced structural conclusions. The next three chapters wrestle with the role of [ ], a fundamental “unit” within the James arithmetic that does not accumulate and in that sense is non-numeric. Some call it infinity. The final content chapter in this volume revisits the spatial dialects of Volume I."

The half-dozen useful theorems are simple combinations of the axioms, usually standing in place of no more than four or five substitution steps. Volume I seeks to describe and to illustrate the visual dynamics of James algebra while emphasizing the conceptual beauty of void-based thinking and thus to motivate a completely different way of thinking about and understanding elementary arithmetic. The meta-goal is also simple: to demonstrate that symbolic mathematics is a choice rather than a necessity by providing a viable iconic alternative"

        "text": "Volume III is an exploration of the interplay between formal symbolic knowledge and void-based iconic innovation. The sections on history, the imaginary J, applications of James algebra and non-numeric forms are relatively independent. The heart of arithmetic consists of three concepts: [[zero]], [[one]] and [[infinity]]. The heart of James algebra embraces three grounding concepts: the nonexistent void, the accumulator ( ) and the unifier [ ]. This volume begins with a resurrection of Euler’s work on the logarithms of negative numbers in the form of the numeric constant [<( )>], abbreviated as J. The first three chapters explore the history, behavior and issues associated with log –1 and its apparent neglect in modern arithmetic. The next three chapters examine the intimate relationship between π, i and J established by Euler. Then follows a collection of applications of postsymbolic formal thinking to selected subfields of elementary mathematics. If iconic arithmetic is more than an isomorphism, then its application should suggest entirely different perspectives on established mathematical systems. These four chapters are unabashedly exploratory, recounting experiments, dead ends and forced structural conclusions. The next three chapters wrestle with the role of [ ], a fundamental “unit” within the James arithmetic that does not accumulate and in that sense is non-numeric. Some call it infinity. The final content chapter in this volume revisits the spatial dialects of Volume I."
