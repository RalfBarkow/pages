In the twenty-first century I was using a style of mathematical thinking from the early twentieth century, ignoring the fundamental evolution of mathematical perspective due to Grothendieck (algebraic geometry), Baez (n-categories), Chaitin (undecidability), Wolfram (universal computation) and others. I began to see that elementary logic and arithmetic are not determined, secure or natural. The iconic tools I had been working with for years have just as valid a claim to mathematical foundations as do the early explorations that led us today into set theory, Boolean logic and functional thinking. The bulk of the mathematical community still bases their formal thinking about numbers on Peano’s axioms, while the modern evolution in mathematical thought appears to have taken place in the more rarefied atmosphere of the unification of advanced abstraction. Short of returning to school, I tried to leverage my antediluvian education to build what appear to be quite different systems of elementary mathematical thinking."

        "text": "I awoke one morning in 2015 to realize that my training in formal systems circa 1980 was, to say the least, antiquated. In the twenty-first century I was using a style of mathematical thinking from the early twentieth century, ignoring the fundamental evolution of mathematical perspective due to Grothendieck (algebraic geometry), Baez (n-categories), Chaitin (undecidability), Wolfram (universal computation) and others. I began to see that elementary logic and arithmetic are not determined, secure or natural. The iconic tools I had been working with for years have just as valid a claim to mathematical foundations as do the early explorations that led us today into set theory, Boolean logic and functional thinking. The bulk of the mathematical community still bases their formal thinking about numbers on Peano’s axioms, while the modern evolution in mathematical thought appears to have taken place in the more rarefied atmosphere of the unification of advanced abstraction. Short of returning to school, I tried to leverage my antediluvian education to build what appear to be quite different systems of elementary mathematical thinking."

Three simple structural James axioms ground iconic transformations throughout the three volumes. From a computational perspective nothing is remote, complicated or indirect, given the narrow focus on elementary math. Here we explore the potential of a postsymbolic math that injects our current formal foundations with multiple heresies while still respecting the formality of mathematics itself. To justify the imposition of new iconic forms and transforms, I’ve described and compared the approaches of several technically different fields including numeric arithmetic and algebra, predicate logic, set theory, computational pattern-matching, educational methods and iconic boundary mathematics. Not only is there no agreement across fields about the basic structures of arithmetic, there is also no communality across tools and objectives. Iconic math adds yet more enrichment through diversity. Volume II feels quite different than Volume I, with deeper, more historical questions at the foundations of the current philosophies of mathematics. This is a necessary volume to address the many technical details about the structures, assumptions and thought processes that we now expect grade school teachers and students to grasp intuitively."
