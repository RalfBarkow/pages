During the investigation of a pneumonia outbreak, researchers noticed particles resembling Gram-positive bacteria residing within amoebae isolated from a water-cooling tower. Because other bacterial species that cause pneumonia, like Legionella pneumophila, reside within amoebae (Rowbotham 1980), the investigators hypothesized that they had found another pneumonia-causing bacterium. Subsequent research, however, showed that they had identified not a bacterium, but a giant virus (La Scola et al. 2003).\n"
