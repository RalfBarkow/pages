      "text": "A European friend, having observed this scene, remarked with both amusement and critical disapproval that the tourists were not properly enjoying the scenery. They were, somehow, oblivious to nature. To him it seemed they were not even having fun, just staging a visit that, precisely because it consisted mainly of choreographing digital photographs, did not really take place (as [[Jean Baudrillard]] might have said). Nowadays this kind of criticism is common, and the friend felt well justified knowing many share his point of view."
