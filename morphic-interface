My understanding of the Morphic paradigm is that the objects on the screen are intended to be your business objects, though as far as I can tell from the Self Movie, Randy Smith and John Maloney did not have business very much in mind.  In other words, the visible object has all the slots (properties and scripts) that it needs to be some part of the computer model that you are working with.  In a similar way, a spreadsheet cell has slots for a formula and a value, but you can't usually manipulate it to add some scripts (behaviours), animations, extra data, or change its location in the grid.",

The user can select any object and invoke display-related as well as business-specific behaviours directly - even when the objects are moving around the screen. Hence Squeak has blurred the line between programming and using a system. However, although Squeak clearly has general-purpose potential (in the words of the Squeak central team, Squeak is 'Smalltalk as it was meant to be'), most of the emphasis to date has been on educational applications, animated graphics, and multi-media authoring tools",

My understanding of the Morphic paradigm is that the objects on the screen are intended to be your business objects, though as far as I can tell from the Self Movie, Randy Smith and John Maloney did not have business very much in mind.  In other words, the visible object has all the slots (properties and scripts) that it needs to be some part of the computer model that you are working with.  In a similar way, a spreadsheet cell has slots for a formula and a value, but you can't usually manipulate it to add some scripts (behaviours), animations, extra data, or change its location in the grid.",
