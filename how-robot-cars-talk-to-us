Each prototype and each study pursued its own approach: Audi experimented with projections, light symbols that the car casts onto the road by means of the headlights, where they are read by other road users. The Swedish supplier Semcom relied on a screen face on the radiator grille that smiles friendly at passers-by when they should cross the road. Similarly humanizing: the giant electric eyes from Jaguar. Including eyelid, iris and pupil, they should make eye contact with road users. As coherent and interesting as the ideas are in each case: Wild growth does not work in road traffic. When autonomous cars hit the road in large numbers, they will need a uniform language. Each car manufacturer establishing its own solution is not a solution."
