While mostly the focus is on the player playing of a video game created by others, the shift to players emerging as designers of story is taking root, too. This comes as more and more tools are available for anyone to become a game designer. But conceiving story in a game flow structure means imagining narrative along mostly non-linear lines. It means writing stories within gaming worlds that give agency to the players, whose"

A revised version appeared in Gardner's July 1977 Scientific American column.\n\nEleusis is sometimes considered an analogy to the problems of scientific method. It can be compared with the card game Mao, which also has secret rules that can be learned inductively. The games of Penultima and Zendo also feature players attempting to discover inductively a secret rule or rules thought of by a \"Master\" or \"Spectators\" who declare plays legal or illegal on the basis of the rules.\n\nThe formalisation of Eleusis+Nobel inspired new modes of communication by exchange of logical notes.[1]\nEleusis Express\n\nIn 2006, John Golden developed a streamlined version of the game, intended to assist elementary school teachers in explaining the scientific method to students. Abbott himself considers the variant a \"great game\", and refers to it as \"Eleusis Express\".[2]"
