It's better if I have somebody who knows the API or schema and has the necessary credentials and cares about their data. It is difficult to understand someone's representations. I have to enter their world and learn their [domain] language. A lot of the work is adding checking and validation. Yes it's JSON and it's valid JSON, but is it formatted with the keys we expect. We prefer to push those checks closer to the extraction rather than discover it in the transform. Do more logging and better diagnostics. When somebody does change something that breaks your ETL and your query starts returning empty rows, you want to know how your going to spend your morning and really just want something to tell you what to fix.
