It is contrasted with die convention used in discussing dosed systems where the final state is given if die initial state and process are known and where a change in the initial state or the process produces a different final state. If a final state is known or desired in an open system (which includes most of them), the alternative beginning points and paths may be altered to hasten, postpone or otherwise change die cyde.
