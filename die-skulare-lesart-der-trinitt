It may be that it does not succeed with the simple believers (who mostly believe exactly what the masters order them to believe), but with theologians accustomed to reflection, who may be accused of everything, but just not of one thing: they do not know what they are talking about, this rational argumentation might have succeeded sooner or later, if these would not have thought of a reason, whose truth exceeds that of the mere intellect. (Theologians, and the church fathers even more so, are mostly people who believe in miracles just as little as philosophers or other reasonable people)."

This knowledge constitutes the God-state in its core - and not mere faith; this can be read in Augustine, the theologian and philosopher who gave Catholicism its final face. (And on this dogma of the Trinity hangs not least and among many other things the historically unique position of the Pope in this Church: but I will spare myself these subtleties of the history of religion here). On this knowledge, on this truth, the western part of the Roman Empire perished. But the God's state that then unfolded in this area (which could certainly be compared with the Taliban state in Afghanistan, as far as the production of wealth is concerned, were it not for the theologically completely different justification and legitimation and structure of the power relations) could not then prevent in the long run that it had to enter into competition with worldly wealth a few centuries later. However, neither it, the divine state, nor the secular powers succeeded in merging into each other, i.e., the Catholic Church did not become the state religion like the Byzantine, Orthodox Church or even Islam."

      "text": "Now the decisive thing, that is, the thing I want to get at this whole evening: What becomes of this God, what happens in him, if I include his concrete provisions: To be Father, Son and Holy Spirit, determinations that bind him into the social reality that also and especially in the state of God depends on obedience and worship (I remind you of the ten commandments)? The first of whom it is known that he dared to undertake this endeavor, and thus also found recognition and circulation among his contemporaries, friends as well as opponents, was Peter Abälard at the beginning of the 12th century. Abälard came up with the idea to turn the vertical structure of the Trinity dogma, i.e. the relationship of the Father, who is in any case, however one wants to understand Trinity, on top, to the Son, who, precisely because of his representation of the world in God, is to be located below, this structure around the middle of this relationship, the mediation by the Holy Spirit, by 90°, so to speak, and thus to understand Trinity as a horizontal line, which no longer needs a secular determination: That which is to be mediated, the truth therefore, is the One, which must delimit itself against its other, its negation. Taken together, this is the core of a synthesis that vouches for truth. This read as Abälard's answer to the central contradiction in the society of his time, that between two different concepts of sovereignty, then its solution is: The opposition between church and state is in principle insoluble, must be accepted as that between being and becoming. In the unity of this opposition, however, a synthesizing sovereignty is formed, which is immanent to it. This will then, some hundred years later, be called capital by Marx."
