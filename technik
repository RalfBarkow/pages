This may be stimulated by the technological developments themselves (e.g. computer technology, jet propulsion of airplanes), further by other requirements of the market (e.g. more differentiated products with small quantities in each case or even individual production according to order), but also by the resistance experiences that had to be made during attempts of implementation. The research interest thus shifts from systematic correlations to perspectives for change planning. Once again, it becomes clear that technical innovations cannot be understood as the application of scientific knowledge available to everyone, but that to a considerable extent \"tacit\", company-specific, if not product-specific knowledge plays a role, emerging when it is needed. At the level of buzzwords, instead of \"humanization of work,\" one now finds \"socially acceptable technology design.\" \"Socially acceptable\" here seems to amount primarily to decentralization and user participation in the planning, introduction and ongoing modification of the system."
