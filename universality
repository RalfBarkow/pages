A set of computations that, composed with one another, permit one to recover the whole set of possible computations in the repertoire of the universal computer is called a ‘universal set’.

These elementary computations are, in this respect, a bit like LEGO bricks: anything that is allowed in a LEGO world (from cars, to villas, to pirate ships) can be decomposed into elementary LEGO bricks of a few elementary different kinds, whose basic composition rules are fixed. Likewise, when there is a universal set, any physically allowed computation can be decomposed into a set of elementary computations from the universal set, sometimes referred to as ‘gates’, which can be composed according to fixed laws. When the laws of physics say that a universal set of computations is possible, we say that they display ‘universality’. Universality is a counterfactual property (about what is possible), and it has sweeping consequences: it is universality that permits the existence of a universal computer, like the ones we use nowadays. This property was first grasped in the Victorian era. At that time, the inventor Charles Babbage proposed a scheme to build what he called the Analytical Engine. This would have been, if realised, the first programmable computer—the ancestor of our modern ones, only far larger and made of brass mechanical cogs and wheels.
