Which particular events disrupt flow the most, and how do you solve them?",

Wayne Rainey was quoted as saying he had a virtual out of body experience during the racing, where he found himself giggling and laughing while piloting the bike (these things do 200mph btw). The key point was he was in a zen like state of concentration where absolutely everything made sense, everything was easy, everything could be controlled, and nobody could beat him. Riders like Doohan claimed to be in this state for every race, and getting there required an elaborate set of preparations, verging on being ritualistic in their precision. I think for the sportsperson the state of 'Flow' might be a bit different due to the fact it produces a 'whole body' type experience, but I find it interesting that Flow is something shared between two things as different as motorcycle racing and typing on a keyboard. -- [[Luke Burton]]",

The book contends directing the sub-conscious is often as simple as feeding plenty of relevant information to your mind about the problem, mulling it over, with or without a lot of conscious problem-solving, i.e. *focusing* on the problem. At some point, you'll have to leave the problem alone - e.g. sleep - and so long as you don't load your mind up with too many other problems to solve, your subconscious will beaver away at it, trying to find a solution. The answer may simply pop into your head as if by inspiration. Granted, that's a very simplistic description (and possibly not-very-accurately remembered) but it often seems to work like that for me.

My brain is not built to handle that many issues at once. I only produce good music when flow, usually after I hear the group around me producing amazing music. Only then do I relax enough to let half of the problems take care of themselves. I play the flute, so I literally imagine the air flowing through my body into the flute and suddenly half my problems take care of themselves. The point is that flow just doesn't happen. I only get there when I know what I'm doing and I'm not thinking about the problems I have to deal with.

Wayne Rainey was quoted as saying he had a virtual out of body experience during the racing, where he found himself giggling and laughing while piloting the bike (these things do 200mph btw). The key point was he was in a zen like state of concentration where absolutely everything made sense, everything was easy, everything could be controlled, and nobody could beat him. Riders like Doohan claimed to be in this state for every race, and getting there required an elaborate set of preparations, verging on being ritualistic in their precision. I think for the sportsperson the state of 'Flow' might be a bit different due to the fact it produces a 'whole body' type experience, but I find it interesting that Flow is something shared between two things as different as motorcycle racing and typing on a keyboard. -- [[Luke Burton]]",

The book contends directing the sub-conscious is often as simple as feeding plenty of relevant information to your mind about the problem, mulling it over, with or without a lot of conscious problem-solving, i.e. *focusing* on the problem. At some point, you'll have to leave the problem alone - e.g. sleep - and so long as you don't load your mind up with too many other problems to solve, your subconscious will beaver away at it, trying to find a solution. The answer may simply pop into your head as if by inspiration. Granted, that's a very simplistic description (and possibly not-very-accurately remembered) but it often seems to work like that for me.

Previously say, writing a novel, has been a task where people would stay up late working on it because you need so many hours of concentration to get it done. Programming eclipses this. I guess that it is \"natural\" for the human organism to really concentrate for only a maximum of perhaps an hour - if even that. What non-programmers consider working (3 or 4 hours at a time of hard concentration) is much tougher than the \"natural\" way the human organism works.  But the arrival on the planet of programming pushes \"concentration needs\" simply to the maximum possible, limited by sleep (and then you work subconsciously while sleeping for a few hours): hence the cliche of living on a few bottles of cola and in pyjamas while programming something really hard.",
