By 1994 most of my writing, training, and consulting was about Smalltalk.  By the end of the 90's I found myself investigating Java and even teaching a few Java courses.  Java is better than C++ and has great libraries, but it's not Smalltalk (or Lisp).  I just hope that Smalltalk is still alive when everyone fantasizing about Java solving their problems realizes it won't.  [I now, late 2004, have a different view than I did when I wrote that statement several years ago.  We have witnessed the near-complete failure of Java applets as a client-side mechanism for delivery dynamic web content and the proliferation of server-side programming efforts.  Meanwhile, the Java API's continued to explode -- \"expand\" is just not a strong enough word -- to the extent that every time you started with an area of Java you haven't used before you ended up buying two or three 1000-page tomes (more like 1500-page by now).  On top of that, EJB began to supplant other object persistence and communication mechanisms, then J2EE distributed service-based architectures, all with an enormously elaborate set of concepts, techniques, and API's to learn.  And with the just-released version 1.5, the base Java language is approaching the complexity and sophistication of C++.  I suppose this demonstrates some inevitable force towards overwhelming complexity inherent in all attempts to supply comprehensive technology, but it's pretty funny that what started out as a language for washing machines, then was touted as a small, easy to learn and use, client-side language is now the back-end, server and even behind-the-server, enterprise technology of choice.]",

At the same time I discovered Python and was instantly smitten, recognizing it as a pure and simple blend of many of the important Quality aspects of Lisp and Smalltalk, with a beautifully simplified syntax.  (I was always a big fan of whitespace as syntax: curly braces are essentially redundant in well-formatted code.)  And thrilled to find that Python had a community and software repository analagous to Perl's.  (My work in Bioinformatics was pushing my face into Perl intolerably often, and <i>Python is to Perl as Java is to C++, only more so</i> was my arch summary of <i>those</i> experiences.)  I taught an introductory programming course to 125 students at Wesleyan in the 2002-03 academic year, as well as an introductory Bioinformatics programming course, both using Python.  I would have used it for my data structures course too, but the department got nervous about that since it was part of the required sequence for the major.  It is stunning how appropriate Python over such a wide range of programming tasks and levels of experience, from simple scripts to enterprise applications and from complete novice to sophisticated expert.",

By 1994 most of my writing, training, and consulting was about Smalltalk.  By the end of the 90's I found myself investigating Java and even teaching a few Java courses.  Java is better than C++ and has great libraries, but it's not Smalltalk (or Lisp).  I just hope that Smalltalk is still alive when everyone fantasizing about Java solving their problems realizes it won't.  [I now, late 2004, have a different view than I did when I wrote that statement several years ago.  We have witnessed the near-complete failure of Java applets as a client-side mechanism for delivery dynamic web content and the proliferation of server-side programming efforts.  Meanwhile, the Java API's continued to explode -- \"expand\" is just not a strong enough word -- to the extent that every time you started with an area of Java you haven't used before you ended up buying two or three 1000-page tomes (more like 1500-page by now).  On top of that, EJB began to supplant other object persistence and communication mechanisms, then J2EE distributed service-based architectures, all with an enormously elaborate set of concepts, techniques, and API's to learn.  And with the just-released version 1.5, the base Java language is approaching the complexity and sophistication of C++.  I suppose this demonstrates some inevitable force towards overwhelming complexity inherent in all attempts to supply comprehensive technology, but it's pretty funny that what started out as a language for washing machines, then was touted as a small, easy to learn and use, client-side language is now the back-end, server and even behind-the-server, enterprise technology of choice.]",

(I was always a big fan of whitespace as syntax: curly braces are essentially redundant in well-formatted code.)  And thrilled to find that Python had a community and software repository analagous to Perl's.  (My work in Bioinformatics was pushing my face into Perl intolerably often, and <i>Python is to Perl as Java is to C++, only more so</i> was my arch summary of <i>those</i> experiences.)  I taught an introductory programming course to 125 students at Wesleyan in the 2002-03 academic year, as well as an introductory Bioinformatics programming course, both using Python.  I would have used it for my data structures course too, but the department got nervous about that since it was part of the required sequence for the major.
