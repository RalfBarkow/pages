Institutions are moving faster than neighborhoods and they take advantage of this speed (often called efficiency), often taking over functions that would be better performed by neighbors in neighborhoods. My belief is that institutions have a certain social and physical configuration which allows them to be catalytic. They can be thought of as sociopolitical enzymes. My intention is to produce faster and better enzyme-like configurations that work in voluntary situations, specifically neighborhoods, and out perform less adaptable settings, specifically top down hierarchical institutions.\n\n\n"

As the world becomes more and more interconnected we experience the consequences. There is an explosion of combinations of interactions driving the complexity we are experiencing. The numbers, the density, and the rapidity of communication between people, across cultures and continents begin to create patterns similar to those we have discovered in physics, chemistry, and biology. One hundred years ago we understood such overwhelming complexity only in of physics, chemistry and microbiology.\n"

Aristotle and Ackoff both claim that every social system has four necessary and sufficient parts which interact to create the specific social system. These are four pretty high level pur- poses each of which is aided or degraded through in- teractions with each of the others. It is Aesthetics (Aristotle’s “Beauty”) that is most human, most fun- damental, primary, primordial, unexplainable, identi- fying, motivating, rationalizing, striving, self-justify- ing. The other three are derivative, or can be derived from Aesthetics. Aesthetics cannot be reliable de- rived from the others, only supported or degraded.\nAesthetics (Beauty) I believe that Aesthetics—hu- man passion for beauty—is the wellspring, the life giving motive force of humans being together. What do we care enough about to create it and sustain it? Beautiful places, beautiful food, beautiful minds, beautiful logic, beautiful artifacts, and beautiful ways of being together.\n"

Human purposes, social purposes and social actions must have a human pace, a rate, that is dependent on the human form--speech, conversation, understanding, agree- ments; movement of hands and feet, the speed of breathing and talking in sentences, thinking thoughts, waiting for associations and insights, find- ing likely partners, planning, navigating, checking, learning, back-tracking, celebrating, weeping. Hu- man emotions and moods have a cadence that runs in hours to days and sometimes months. Moods and emotions are slow biological systems.

We must create and sustain our own en- zyme-like places to provide space, time, and attrac- tions for actors and actions, places and methods that ensure that the right people are sitting next to each other for long enough. With our neighborhoods, we must design enzyme-like locales for our human-scale and human-speed interactions, without ignoring the increasingly complex, interconnected, interacting, potentially overwhelming environment that includes every person and institution on earth.\n\n# PLACES\nI imagine neighborhoods enabled with agora and mechanisms fit for local and slow. These neighbor- hoods will begin to design their relations with other neighborhoods, each supported by its own enzyme-like agora. The big idea here is catalytic spaces that protect and support the essential rate and nature for human beauty creation, where we gradually replace our ugly, top down approaches to managing complex- ity—often crudely done through amputations and blunt restrictions—propped up with misconceived claims of efficiency, practicality, and affordability. Af- fordability, practicality and efficiency should be de- fined and managed at the slow and local levels, pro- tected in our enzyme-like neighborhood places.\n\n"

The building is named, Qulturum. People meet there and learn how to learn. They “act into know- ing” according to Göran Henriks, the director of Qulturum since its inception. Their health system re- sults have become famous. Health care and govern- ment leaders make the pilgrimage from across the world. Many try to imitate it. I have traveled there five times, a week at a time, to understand what the dynamics are around this place—Qulturum.\n"

The thirteen municipalities that have jurisdiction over schools, transport, eldercare, social services, and more, have not yet been attracted to the place or its methods. This problem with brands must be dealt with at the inception as it is very difficult to change people minds or adapt methods to different cultures when they feel left out.\n\n# HIGHLANDER FOLK SCHOOL\nSecond: Miles Horton and his Highlander Folk School is the place from which both the unionization of the Southeastern US and the civil rights move- ments originated. There are documentaries and books that share the remarkable story. I highly rec- ommend that you look in to the history and the ef- fect that Highlander has had. It was a designed place, an enzyme-like place, where specific people were in- vited, placed in proximity, slowed down, held togeth- er, until something binding happened between them. From each other, these people learned how to learn. Then they went back to their places and continued learning how to learn by talking and taking action to- gether, again and again."

His approach could never become a universal approach because, lacking an enemy whom you are willing to confront, there was no motive and no method.\n\n"

        "text": "NEIGHBORHOOD CHEMISTRY\nCHANGING OUR LIVES BY CHANGING OUR NEIGH- BORHOODS\nMANAGING SOCIAL COMPLEXI- TY\nAn apology: this whole piece and the whole book is about moving up one level, above the level that we have been thinking and working. We are all familiar with the different ways children and parents think. We are going to look at “parental thinking” about how our neighborhoods function. Our neighbor- hoods can be the places that make us happy.\nSome of us hope to go back to better times. Others of us hope to leap into new and better times. My goal is for us to create today what we really desire.\nThe ideas presented here must be handy, must be useful, for absolutely normal people. If we get it right, these ideas and practices will go viral.\nFAMILIAR SOCIAL ENZYMES\nI studied chemistry and started a PhD in biochem- istry because I like the way biochemistry worked. I could understand it and it mirrored the sociopolitical world as I understood it.\nSocial bonds are affected by spatial configurations— the arrangement of seating, where the administrative offices are placed, location of coffee shops.\nEnzymes combine or cleve molecules through the at- traction, placement, orientation, thus changing rate of interaction—meta control is through the of amount of enzyme or configuration of enzymes. Pathology in any of these aspects unbalances the situ- ation producing too much or too little of an essential component to the life of the organism.\nAlmost all metabolic processes in the cell need en- zymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sus- tain life. (Wikipedia accessed Oct 27, 2017)\nSo here is my big point. Institutions are moving faster than neighborhoods and they take advantage of this speed (often called efficiency), often taking over functions that would be better performed by neighbors in neighborhoods. My belief is that institu- tions have a certain social and physical configuration which allows them to be catalytic. They can be thought of as sociopolitical enzymes. My intention is to produce faster and better enzyme-like configura- tions that work in voluntary situations, specifically neighborhoods, and out perform less adaptable set- tings, specifically top down hierarchal institutions.\nBEGINNING\nSocieties are beginning to become overwhelmingly complex, but we don't know how to think about it yet. We don’t yet know how to participate in massive complexity. Some of us turn a blind eye to it and are swept along. Others, comfortable with a slower sim- pler time, try to withdraw, or even attempt to stop it or slow it down.\nIncalculable complexity is surfacing increasingly at the social level. For example: culturally, we have moved from English freemen and surfs doing the farming with hand tools, to industrialized mechaniza- tion, then to complete industrialization of farming, now to global agribusiness. As the world becomes more and more interconnected we experience the consequences. There is an explosion of combinations of interactions driving the complexity we are experi- encing.\nThe numbers, the density, and the rapidity of com- munication between people, across cultures and con- tinents begin to create patterns similar to those we\n1\n\nhave discovered in physics, chemistry, and biology. One hundred years ago we understood such over- whelming complexity only in of physics, chem- istry and microbiology.\nIn physics, chemistry and biology, we can appreciate role of time and movement and speed. The small- er things are, the faster they tend to move. At the atomic and molecular level things move very fast and unpredictably. At the subatomic levels of physics there are lots of things moving even faster. At all these levels things are running into one another, changing, transforming, combining, breaking. The re- sulting macroscopic behaviors, the behaviors of large chunks, show up as kinds of averages, obscuring the mechanisms and the unimaginable variation be- low the surface of those visible chunks.\nMASTERING COMPLEXITY\nSomething interesting happens between the scales of chemistry and bio-chemistry—that is between chem- istry and biology. This something may hold a key to the mastery of social complexity.\nIt is easy to unreflectively assume that everything in the universe is happening at the speed of our own ex- periences, at the speed of human thought and con- versation and bodily motion. Such a default assump- tion occurs because we tend to image things by anal- ogy with our embodied experiences. (Metaphors We Live By, George Lakoff) At first we are always a little surprised when we notice that things move much slower or much faster than we do.\nHow to manage complex? That is a most interest- ing and urgent question. How can our human purpos- es be realized in a massively complex social world-- when most of our political explanations and strate- gies are decidedly non-complex, overly simple, and sometimes simply hopeful.\nIt seems likely that some of our purposes only have a chance to be developed in slower settings.\n(Fijian Bures)\n(Syntegration)\nOne thing is certain, we cannot slow the whole thing down--we cannot move the physical or social world toward some social equivalent of absolute zero, the temperature where molecules are immobile. But we probably can slow down, hold near, hold out, cool off if we create appropriately designed spaces.\nEnzymes are my ideal example of designed spaces that control complexity. Enzymes amaze me. They change the game, more accurately they create the games. They make the most statistically improba- bly events become routine. They are masters of chemical complexity. They make life possible. En- zymes create micro-micro-neighborhoods by putting specific desired neighbors into close proximity. En- zymes, in effect, remove the noise and distractions of movement and allow the chemical reactions (conver- sations and agreements) to occur that are likely to oc- cur only when these two neighbors are interacting to- gether without distraction for long enough. These new chemical bonds (binding contracts) tend to hold for a long time.\nSo, for a given purpose or a given set of purposes what analogue to enzymes can we devise?\nHUMAN WELLBEING\nWhat potentials and purposes are essential for hu- man wellbeing on a planet whose own wellbeing must also be preserved? Aristotle and Ackoff both claim that every social system has four necessary and sufficient parts which interact to create the specific social system. These are four pretty high level pur- poses each of which is aided or degraded through in- teractions with each of the others. It is Aesthetics (Aristotle’s “Beauty”) that is most human, most fun- damental, primary, primordial, unexplainable, identi- fying, motivating, rationalizing, striving, self-justify- ing. The other three are derivative, or can be derived from Aesthetics. Aesthetics cannot be reliable de- rived from the others, only supported or degraded.\nAesthetics (Beauty) I believe that Aesthetics—hu- man passion for beauty—is the wellspring, the life giving motive force of humans being together. What\n2\n\ndo we care enough about to create it and sustain it? Beautiful places, beautiful food, beautiful minds, beautiful logic, beautiful artifacts, and beautiful ways of being together.\nEthics (Good). I believe that Ethics is the way we attempt to ensure that Aesthetics are available to each other. At its most fundamental, Ethics is Fair- ness. Ethics also relate to Science (Truth)—everyone should have access to Truth to be Fair. Ethics also ap- plies to Economy. Production should in some way be fair or equitable.\nScience (Truth). I believe that Science is a way to increase the likelihood of producing what is Aestheti- cally pleasing and not its opposite. Science is a way of knowing, understanding, and deciding how things are and how things work. Beyond Aesthetics, Truth must be shared to support both Ethics (fairness) and Econ- omy.\nProduction (Economy).A way of creating what is beautiful (desirable) while honoring what is ethical (fair) and what is true (technically possible).\nSo back to social complexity and enzymes. These four—Aesthetics, Ethics, Science, and Production— are our social systems’ parts. Human purposes, social purposes and social actions must have a human pace, a rate, that is dependent on the human form--speech, conversation, understanding, agree- ments; movement of hands and feet, the speed of breathing and talking in sentences, thinking thoughts, waiting for associations and insights, find- ing likely partners, planning, navigating, checking, learning, back-tracking, celebrating, weeping. Hu- man emotions and moods have a cadence that runs in hours to days and sometimes months. Moods and emotions are slow biological systems. So we need enzyme-like settings that protect against inhuman speed, that remove distractions—the pushing and pulling of irrelevancies.\nTHREE COMPLEXITY FILTERS\n1. RELEVANCE\nIn managing human complexity, relevance is first and biggest filter to apply, the first step toward reduc- ing complexity--by focusing only on what is relevant, by omitting or positively excluding the irrelevant the largest set of interactions and distractions are re- moved.\n2. LOCALNESS\nFrom my point of view, most of the truly human forms of beauty are local and intimate, where we are in contact with—dirt, water, sunlight, paths, visible landscapes, fauna, friends and foes, hand tools, gath- erings, conversations, listening, understanding, mar- ket places, homes, work places. The creation of Aes- thetics (Beauty) needs agoras—places where we have conversations about what we care about, where we make shared commitments and take action to- gether, and where through trial and error we safely learn what we are capable of together.\n3. SLOWNESS\nSlowing down is essential wherever and whenever it makes sense to pursue more beautiful, just, true, and productive interactions with others in our neigh- borhoods. We must create and sustain our own en- zyme-like places to provide space, time, and attrac- tions for actors and actions, places and methods that ensure that the right people are sitting next to each other for long enough. With our neighborhoods, we must design enzyme-like locales for our human-scale and human-speed interactions, without ignoring the increasingly complex, interconnected, interacting, potentially overwhelming environment that includes every person and institution on earth.\nPLACES\nI imagine neighborhoods enabled with agora and mechanisms fit for local and slow. These neighbor- hoods will begin to design their relations with other neighborhoods, each supported by its own enzyme-\n3\n\nlike agora. The big idea here is catalytic spaces that protect and support the essential rate and nature for human beauty creation, where we gradually replace our ugly, top down approaches to managing complex- ity—often crudely done through amputations and blunt restrictions—propped up with misconceived claims of efficiency, practicality, and affordability. Af- fordability, practicality and efficiency should be de- fined and managed at the slow and local levels, pro- tected in our enzyme-like neighborhood places.\nPARTICIPATION\nParticipation, creative participation, among peo- ple is the antidote to the alienation which results from consuming things you have had no hand in mak- ing and listening to people you can never sit with and get to know.\nAffection (Aesthetics, Love) can lead to respect and curiosity, these three together can lead to amazing wellbeing and productivity (flourishing) that honors people and planet. We must create enzyme- like places in our neighborhoods and communities to keep affection, respect, and curiosity in play within an increasingly interconnected and complex world. In this way we maymaster complexity—we cancreate desirable lives and communities with- in this complex world.\nEXAMPLES\nI will offer three examples of successful enzyme-like local agora.\nQULTURUM\nFirst: There is an almost magical county in Sweden where an enzyme-like place was designed and built in 1998. The building is named, Qulturum. People meet there and learn how to learn. They “act into know- ing” according to Göran Henriks, the director of Qulturum since its inception. Their health system re- sults have become famous. Health care and govern- ment leaders make the pilgrimage from across the\nworld. Many try to imitate it. I have traveled there five times, a week at a time, to understand what the dynamics are around this place—Qulturum.\nAs successful as Jonkoping County Council and Qul- turum have been, they only attract the medical sector —they are indelibly labeled with their original mis- sion, to improve the medical system. The thirteen municipalities that have jurisdiction over schools, transport, eldercare, social services, and more, have not yet been attracted to the place or its methods. This problem with brands must be dealt with at the inception as it is very difficult to change people minds or adapt methods to different cultures when they feel left out.\nHIGHLANDER FOLK SCHOOL\nSecond: Miles Horton and his Highlander Folk School is the place from which both the unionization of the Southeastern US and the civil rights move- ments originated. There are documentaries and books that share the remarkable story. I highly rec- ommend that you look in to the history and the ef- fect that Highlander has had. It was a designed place, an enzyme-like place, where specific people were in- vited, placed in proximity, slowed down, held togeth- er, until something binding happened between them. From each other, these people learned how to learn. Then they went back to their places and continued learning how to learn by talking and taking action to- gether, again and again.\nHighlander Folk School has been renamed, High- lander Research and Education Center. It is twenty- three miles, a thirty minute drive, east of Knoxville, TN, near the town of New Market, TN.\nAs successful as Miles Horton was, his approach nev- er reached his highest hope. He was seeking some- thing more universal, even more effective. My con- clusion is, while Horton rejected the overt confronta- tional approach used by his friend, Saul Alinsky, Hor- ton none the less still relied on opposition and antag- onism, for fuel, for motivation. His approach could never become a universal approach because, lacking\n4\n\nan enemy whom you are willing to confront, there was no motive and no method.\nI think that what is needed is a emotionally com- pelling (exciting) and unifying positive, rather than just negative, source of power. Russ Ackoff gave us that possibility—Idealized Design.\nCAMPFIRE AND FIJIAN BURE\nThird and final example: Possibly the oldest hu- man scale enzyme-like human space is a fire at the mouth of a cave were our ancestors sat and talked and listened. These may have been the original spaces of social cohesion and social innovation.\nWhile sailing among the islands of Fiji I was privi- leged to sit each evening among small groups, always passing a half coconut shell of kava around the circle, each person randomly speaking to the center, to no one and to everyone, about nothing and everything. In these villages, over months, I never saw a crying child, I saw no conflict, I saw everyone lending a hand, I saw no overt governance. I saw smiles every- where. Something magical has been happening here for a long long time.\nAMERICAN CATALYTIC AGORA\nThese first two examples are presented because they have each been remarkably successful—where so many other efforts have failed. My criticism of Qul- turum and Highlander is only to anticipate a uniquely American agora, special communal places, which must be safe enough for voluntary participation, must not be built on antagonism and must not be ex- perienced as exclusive. They must produce their own trust. Importantly, they must provide and support critical enzyme-like mechanisms, which I detail in other essays.\nThesemethodsandtoolswhichcansupportcommunity-scale mechanisms include: Community Linkage Mappings, Ack- off’s Idealized Design, Beer’s Viable Systems Model, V ester’s SensitivityModel,andBeer’sSyntegration.Thereisalikely sequence—local creation of relevant Linkage Maps, Ideal-\nized Design for small projects, Syntegrtion for large projects. V iable S ystem M odel is used for diagnosis and healing of structural weaknesses. V ester’s Sysitivity Model is used to agree on sequence in large projects.\nI currently imagine the first agora as our schools— grade schools, middle schools, high schools, and com- munity colleges. These places already have local rele- vance, are generally non-threatening and they sup- port the development of our children the very people most dear to families and neighbors—our embodied future.\nSo we may bring to our school buildings the relevant methods and tools to support the aspirations of our- selves and our neighbors. Nothing heavy handed. Al- ways emergent, built upon passion, and trusting one another.\nFinal Note\nWhat has been presented here?\nCampfires and bonfires are different. Campfires do not scale up. Around campfires people have a pace and space for slow conversations and sharing subtle details. People can think and plan together around camp fires. Bonfires allow only short loud interrup- tions over the pervasive noise of the fire. The scale and the heat of bonfires separate people while hold- ing them within a harsh light. People can be moved to coarse actions by bonfires. All subtlety is lost.\nSUMMARY\nWhat was this piece about?\n5\n\nNext Step: Agora phase two: Op- erations Rooms for neighbor- hoods.\nAuthor: Marc Pierson, protected by Community Commons —Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n \n 6\n"

Af- fordability, practicality and efficiency should be de- fined and managed at the slow and local levels, pro- tected in our enzyme-like neighborhood places.\nPARTICIPATION\nParticipation, creative participation, among peo- ple is the antidote to the alienation which results from consuming things you have had no hand in mak- ing and listening to people you can never sit with and get to know.\nAffection (Aesthetics, Love) can lead to respect and curiosity, these three together can lead to amazing wellbeing and productivity (flourishing) that honors people and planet. We must create enzyme- like places in our neighborhoods and communities to keep affection, respect, and curiosity in play within an increasingly interconnected and complex world. In this way we maymaster complexity—we cancreate desirable lives and communities with- in this complex world.\nEXAMPLES\nI will offer three examples of successful enzyme-like local agora.\nQULTURUM\nFirst: There is an almost magical county in Sweden where an enzyme-like place was designed and built in 1998. The building is named, Qulturum. People meet there and learn how to learn. They “act into know- ing” according to Göran Henriks, the director of Qulturum since its inception. Their health system re- sults have become famous. Health care and govern- ment leaders make the pilgrimage from across the\nworld. Many try to imitate it. I have traveled there five times, a week at a time, to understand what the dynamics are around this place—Qulturum.\nAs successful as Jonkoping County Council and Qul- turum have been, they only attract the medical sector —they are indelibly labeled with their original mis- sion, to improve the medical system. The thirteen municipalities that have jurisdiction over schools, transport, eldercare, social services, and more, have not yet been attracted to the place or its methods. This problem with brands must be dealt with at the inception as it is very difficult to change people minds or adapt methods to different cultures when they feel left out.\nHIGHLANDER FOLK SCHOOL\nSecond: Miles Horton and his Highlander Folk School is the place from which both the unionization of the Southeastern US and the civil rights move- ments originated. There are documentaries and books that share the remarkable story. I highly rec- ommend that you look in to the history and the ef- fect that Highlander has had. It was a designed place, an enzyme-like place, where specific people were in- vited, placed in proximity, slowed down, held togeth- er, until something binding happened between them. From each other, these people learned how to learn. Then they went back to their places and continued learning how to learn by talking and taking action to- gether, again and again.\nHighlander Folk School has been renamed, High- lander Research and Education Center. It is twenty- three miles, a thirty minute drive, east of Knoxville, TN, near the town of New Market, TN.\nAs successful as Miles Horton was, his approach nev- er reached his highest hope. He was seeking some- thing more universal, even more effective. My con- clusion is, while Horton rejected the overt confronta- tional approach used by his friend, Saul Alinsky, Hor- ton none the less still relied on opposition and antag- onism, for fuel, for motivation. His approach could never become a universal approach because, lacking\n4\n\nan enemy whom you are willing to confront, there was no motive and no method.\nI think that what is needed is a emotionally com- pelling (exciting) and unifying positive, rather than just negative, source of power. Russ Ackoff gave us that possibility—Idealized Design.\nCAMPFIRE AND FIJIAN BURE\nThird and final example: Possibly the oldest hu- man scale enzyme-like human space is a fire at the mouth of a cave were our ancestors sat and talked and listened. These may have been the original spaces of social cohesion and social innovation.\nWhile sailing among the islands of Fiji I was privi- leged to sit each evening among small groups, always passing a half coconut shell of kava around the circle, each person randomly speaking to the center, to no one and to everyone, about nothing and everything. In these villages, over months, I never saw a crying child, I saw no conflict, I saw everyone lending a hand, I saw no overt governance. I saw smiles every- where. Something magical has been happening here for a long long time.\nAMERICAN CATALYTIC AGORA\nThese first two examples are presented because they have each been remarkably successful—where so many other efforts have failed. My criticism of Qul- turum and Highlander is only to anticipate a uniquely American agora, special communal places, which must be safe enough for voluntary participation, must not be built on antagonism and must not be ex- perienced as exclusive. They must produce their own trust. Importantly, they must provide and support critical enzyme-like mechanisms, which I detail in other essays.\nThesemethodsandtoolswhichcansupportcommunity-scale mechanisms include: Community Linkage Mappings, Ack- off’s Idealized Design, Beer’s Viable Systems Model, V ester’s SensitivityModel,andBeer’sSyntegration.Thereisalikely sequence—local creation of relevant Linkage Maps, Ideal-\nized Design for small projects, Syntegrtion for large projects. V iable S ystem M odel is used for diagnosis and healing of structural weaknesses. V ester’s Sysitivity Model is used to agree on sequence in large projects.\nI currently imagine the first agora as our schools— grade schools, middle schools, high schools, and com- munity colleges. These places already have local rele- vance, are generally non-threatening and they sup- port the development of our children the very people most dear to families and neighbors—our embodied future.\nSo we may bring to our school buildings the relevant methods and tools to support the aspirations of our- selves and our neighbors. Nothing heavy handed. Al- ways emergent, built upon passion, and trusting one another.\nFinal Note\nWhat has been presented here?\nCampfires and bonfires are different. Campfires do not scale up. Around campfires people have a pace and space for slow conversations and sharing subtle details. People can think and plan together around camp fires. Bonfires allow only short loud interrup- tions over the pervasive noise of the fire. The scale and the heat of bonfires separate people while hold- ing them within a harsh light. People can be moved to coarse actions by bonfires. All subtlety is lost.\nSUMMARY\nWhat was this piece about?\n5\n\nNext Step: Agora phase two: Op- erations Rooms for neighbor- hoods.\nAuthor: Marc Pierson, protected by Community Commons —Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n \n 6\n"

Aristotle and Ackoff both claim that every social system has four necessary and sufficient parts which interact to create the specific social system. These are four pretty high level pur- poses each of which is aided or degraded through in- teractions with each of the others. It is Aesthetics (Aristotle’s “Beauty”) that is most human, most fun- damental, primary, primordial, unexplainable, identi- fying, motivating, rationalizing, striving, self-justify- ing. The other three are derivative, or can be derived from Aesthetics. Aesthetics cannot be reliable de- rived from the others, only supported or degraded.\nAesthetics (Beauty) I believe that Aesthetics—hu- man passion for beauty—is the wellspring, the life giving motive force of humans being together. What do we care enough about to create it and sustain it? Beautiful places, beautiful food, beautiful minds, beautiful logic, beautiful artifacts, and beautiful ways of being together.\n"

These four—Aesthetics, Ethics, Science, and Production— are our social systems’ parts. Human purposes, social purposes and social actions must have a human pace, a rate, that is dependent on the human form--speech, conversation, understanding, agree- ments; movement of hands and feet, the speed of breathing and talking in sentences, thinking thoughts, waiting for associations and insights, find- ing likely partners, planning, navigating, checking, learning, back-tracking, celebrating, weeping. Hu- man emotions and moods have a cadence that runs in hours to days and sometimes months. Moods and emotions are slow biological systems. So we need enzyme-like settings that protect against inhuman speed, that remove distractions—the pushing and pulling of irrelevancies.\nTHREE COMPLEXITY FILTERS\n1. RELEVANCE\nIn managing human complexity, relevance is first and biggest filter to apply, the first step toward reduc- ing complexity--by focusing only on what is relevant, by omitting or positively excluding the irrelevant the largest set of interactions and distractions are re- moved.\n2. LOCALNESS\nFrom my point of view, most of the truly human forms of beauty are local and intimate, where we are in contact with—dirt, water, sunlight, paths, visible landscapes, fauna, friends and foes, hand tools, gath- erings, conversations, listening, understanding, mar- ket places, homes, work places. The creation of Aes- thetics (Beauty) needs agoras—places where we have conversations about what we care about, where we make shared commitments and take action to- gether, and where through trial and error we safely learn what we are capable of together.\n3. SLOWNESS\nSlowing down is essential wherever and whenever it makes sense to pursue more beautiful, just, true, and productive interactions with others in our neigh- borhoods. We must create and sustain our own en- zyme-like places to provide space, time, and attrac- tions for actors and actions, places and methods that ensure that the right people are sitting next to each other for long enough. With our neighborhoods, we must design enzyme-like locales for our human-scale and human-speed interactions, without ignoring the increasingly complex, interconnected, interacting, potentially overwhelming environment that includes every person and institution on earth.\nPLACES\nI imagine neighborhoods enabled with agora and mechanisms fit for local and slow. These neighbor- hoods will begin to design their relations with other neighborhoods, each supported by its own enzyme-\n3\n\nlike agora. The big idea here is catalytic spaces that protect and support the essential rate and nature for human beauty creation, where we gradually replace our ugly, top down approaches to managing complex- ity—often crudely done through amputations and blunt restrictions—propped up with misconceived claims of efficiency, practicality, and affordability. Af- fordability, practicality and efficiency should be de- fined and managed at the slow and local levels, pro- tected in our enzyme-like neighborhood places.\nPARTICIPATION\nParticipation, creative participation, among peo- ple is the antidote to the alienation which results from consuming things you have had no hand in mak- ing and listening to people you can never sit with and get to know.\nAffection (Aesthetics, Love) can lead to respect and curiosity, these three together can lead to amazing wellbeing and productivity (flourishing) that honors people and planet.

We must create and sustain our own en- zyme-like places to provide space, time, and attrac- tions for actors and actions, places and methods that ensure that the right people are sitting next to each other for long enough. With our neighborhoods, we must design enzyme-like locales for our human-scale and human-speed interactions, without ignoring the increasingly complex, interconnected, interacting, potentially overwhelming environment that includes every person and institution on earth.\nPLACES\nI imagine neighborhoods enabled with agora and mechanisms fit for local and slow. These neighbor- hoods will begin to design their relations with other neighborhoods, each supported by its own enzyme-\n3\n\nlike agora. The big idea here is catalytic spaces that protect and support the essential rate and nature for human beauty creation, where we gradually replace our ugly, top down approaches to managing complex- ity—often crudely done through amputations and blunt restrictions—propped up with misconceived claims of efficiency, practicality, and affordability. Af- fordability, practicality and efficiency should be de- fined and managed at the slow and local levels, pro- tected in our enzyme-like neighborhood places.\nPARTICIPATION\nParticipation, creative participation, among peo- ple is the antidote to the alienation which results from consuming things you have had no hand in mak- ing and listening to people you can never sit with and get to know.\nAffection (Aesthetics, Love) can lead to respect and curiosity, these three together can lead to amazing wellbeing and productivity (flourishing) that honors people and planet. We must create enzyme- like places in our neighborhoods and communities to keep affection, respect, and curiosity in play within an increasingly interconnected and complex world. In this way we maymaster complexity—we cancreate desirable lives and communities with- in this complex world.\nEXAMPLES\nI will offer three examples of successful enzyme-like local agora.\nQULTURUM\nFirst: There is an almost magical county in Sweden where an enzyme-like place was designed and built in 1998. The building is named, Qulturum. People meet there and learn how to learn. They “act into know- ing” according to Göran Henriks, the director of Qulturum since its inception. Their health system re- sults have become famous. Health care and govern- ment leaders make the pilgrimage from across the\nworld. Many try to imitate it. I have traveled there five times, a week at a time, to understand what the dynamics are around this place—Qulturum.\nAs successful as Jonkoping County Council and Qul- turum have been, they only attract the medical sector —they are indelibly labeled with their original mis- sion, to improve the medical system. The thirteen municipalities that have jurisdiction over schools, transport, eldercare, social services, and more, have not yet been attracted to the place or its methods. This problem with brands must be dealt with at the inception as it is very difficult to change people minds or adapt methods to different cultures when they feel left out.\nHIGHLANDER FOLK SCHOOL\nSecond: Miles Horton and his Highlander Folk School is the place from which both the unionization of the Southeastern US and the civil rights move- ments originated. There are documentaries and books that share the remarkable story. I highly rec- ommend that you look in to the history and the ef- fect that Highlander has had. It was a designed place, an enzyme-like place, where specific people were in- vited, placed in proximity, slowed down, held togeth- er, until something binding happened between them. From each other, these people learned how to learn. Then they went back to their places and continued learning how to learn by talking and taking action to- gether, again and again.\nHighlander Folk School has been renamed, High- lander Research and Education Center. It is twenty- three miles, a thirty minute drive, east of Knoxville, TN, near the town of New Market, TN.\nAs successful as Miles Horton was, his approach nev- er reached his highest hope. He was seeking some- thing more universal, even more effective. My con- clusion is, while Horton rejected the overt confronta- tional approach used by his friend, Saul Alinsky, Hor- ton none the less still relied on opposition and antag- onism, for fuel, for motivation. His approach could never become a universal approach because, lacking\n4\n\nan enemy whom you are willing to confront, there was no motive and no method.\nI think that what is needed is a emotionally com- pelling (exciting) and unifying positive, rather than just negative, source of power. Russ Ackoff gave us that possibility—Idealized Design.\nCAMPFIRE AND FIJIAN BURE\nThird and final example: Possibly the oldest hu- man scale enzyme-like human space is a fire at the mouth of a cave were our ancestors sat and talked and listened. These may have been the original spaces of social cohesion and social innovation.\nWhile sailing among the islands of Fiji I was privi- leged to sit each evening among small groups, always passing a half coconut shell of kava around the circle, each person randomly speaking to the center, to no one and to everyone, about nothing and everything. In these villages, over months, I never saw a crying child, I saw no conflict, I saw everyone lending a hand, I saw no overt governance. I saw smiles every- where. Something magical has been happening here for a long long time.\nAMERICAN CATALYTIC AGORA\nThese first two examples are presented because they have each been remarkably successful—where so many other efforts have failed. My criticism of Qul- turum and Highlander is only to anticipate a uniquely American agora, special communal places, which must be safe enough for voluntary participation, must not be built on antagonism and must not be ex- perienced as exclusive. They must produce their own trust. Importantly, they must provide and support critical enzyme-like mechanisms, which I detail in other essays.\nThesemethodsandtoolswhichcansupportcommunity-scale mechanisms include: Community Linkage Mappings, Ack- off’s Idealized Design, Beer’s Viable Systems Model, V ester’s SensitivityModel,andBeer’sSyntegration.Thereisalikely sequence—local creation of relevant Linkage Maps, Ideal-\nized Design for small projects, Syntegrtion for large projects. V iable S ystem M odel is used for diagnosis and healing of structural weaknesses. V ester’s Sysitivity Model is used to agree on sequence in large projects.\nI currently imagine the first agora as our schools— grade schools, middle schools, high schools, and com- munity colleges. These places already have local rele- vance, are generally non-threatening and they sup- port the development of our children the very people most dear to families and neighbors—our embodied future.\nSo we may bring to our school buildings the relevant methods and tools to support the aspirations of our- selves and our neighbors. Nothing heavy handed. Al- ways emergent, built upon passion, and trusting one another.\nFinal Note\nWhat has been presented here?\nCampfires and bonfires are different. Campfires do not scale up. Around campfires people have a pace and space for slow conversations and sharing subtle details. People can think and plan together around camp fires. Bonfires allow only short loud interrup- tions over the pervasive noise of the fire. The scale and the heat of bonfires separate people while hold- ing them within a harsh light. People can be moved to coarse actions by bonfires. All subtlety is lost.\nSUMMARY\nWhat was this piece about?\n5\n\nNext Step: Agora phase two: Op- erations Rooms for neighbor- hoods.\nAuthor: Marc Pierson, protected by Community Commons —Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n \n 6\n"

Around campfires people have a pace and space for slow conversations and sharing subtle details. People can think and plan together around camp fires. Bonfires allow only short loud interrup- tions over the pervasive noise of the fire. The scale and the heat of bonfires separate people while hold- ing them within a harsh light. People can be moved to coarse actions by bonfires. All subtlety is lost.\n\n"

His approach could never become a universal approach because, lacking an enemy whom you are willing to confront, there was no motive and no method.\n\n"

My belief is that institutions have a certain social and physical configuration which allows them to be catalytic. They can be thought of as sociopolitical enzymes. My intention is to produce faster and better enzyme-like configurations that work in voluntary situations, specifically neighborhoods, and out perform less adaptable settings, specifically top down hierarchical institutions.\n\n\n"

The numbers, the density, and the rapidity of communication between people, across cultures and continents begin to create patterns similar to those we have discovered in physics, chemistry, and biology.
