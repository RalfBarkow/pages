There is no global broadcast system, and the timing and order in which individuals receive information may also change the semantics of that information. The notion of necessary contradiction implies the need to understand better how people manage these contradictions in the workplace and how systems can be designed to provide frameworks for their negotiation. Frames of reference can be devised to run individual strategies along parallel tracks with no overlap – a version of \"separate but equal\" (or unequal as the case may be). In sociological terms, this is a mechanical division of labor. This solution is unstable, because as soon as cooperation is required, power struggles begin over the nature of shared language. Understanding negotiations at all levels is thus a key theme of social informatics."
