After seven sketches we read Leinster's Basic Category theory. This book is not applied and directed towards mathematicians. It is a very thorough introduction to the basic topics of category theory. After that, we read David Corfield's [[Modal Homotopy Type Theory]] highlighting the use of category theory in philosophy. Corfield is also a host of the n-Category Café.
