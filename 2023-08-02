      "text": "It is beyond the scope of this chapter [⇒ [[Interpenetration]]] to draw conclusions for a theory of mental systems. My guess, however, and this at least may be implied, is that some themes and even ambitions of the philosophy of consciousness will reappear in this context. We delete the assertion that consciousness is the subject. It is this only for itself. Nevertheless, it can be understood that autopoiesis in the medium of consciousness is closed and open at the same time. In every structure it adopts, adapts, changes or abandons, it is connected to social systems. This is true for \"[[Pattern Recognition]]\", for language and for everything else. Despite this coupling, it is genuinely autonomous, because only that can be structure which can guide the autopoiesis of consciousness and reproduce itself in it. Thus, one also finds access to the potential of consciousness transcending all social experience and to a typology of need for meaning that guarantees consciousness its own autopoiesis in the alternation of all specific structures of meaning. In the context of an investigation of \"interpretations of life\", Dieter Henrich has treated happiness and distress as such forms of meaning which permeate a whole consciousness without being tangible and correctable in specific forms of meaning."

If this is omitted, neoliberal individualism gains the upper hand, and with it the lie that everyone can and should be responsible only for themselves."

        "text": "It is beyond the scope of this chapter [⇒ [[Interpenetration]]] to draw conclusions for a theory of mental systems. My guess, however, and this at least may be implied, is that some themes and even ambitions of the philosophy of consciousness will reappear in this context. We delete the assertion that consciousness is the subject. It is this only for itself. Nevertheless, it can be understood that autopoiesis in the medium of consciousness is closed and open at the same time. In every structure it adopts, adapts, changes or abandons, it is connected to social systems. This is true for \"[[Pattern Recognition]]\", for language and for everything else. Despite this coupling, it is genuinely autonomous, because only that can be structure which can guide the autopoiesis of consciousness and reproduce itself in it. Thus, one also finds access to the potential of consciousness transcending all social experience and to a typology of need for meaning that guarantees consciousness its own autopoiesis in the alternation of all specific structures of meaning. In the context of an investigation of \"interpretations of life\", Dieter Henrich has treated happiness and distress as such forms of meaning which permeate a whole consciousness without being tangible and correctable in specific forms of meaning."
