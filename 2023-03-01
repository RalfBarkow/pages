However, Beer hinted at this level in Brain of the Firm with his description of the parasympathetic nervous system. The Viable System Model can be difficult to understand at first, especially in its biological form. Beer wrote a trilogy of books to explain the model: Brain of the Firm (1972), Heart of the Enterprise (1979), and Diagnosing the System for Organizations (1985). Readers who want to learn more about the Viable System Model should start with the third book, Diagnosing the System for Organizations (New York: J. Wiley, 1985). In my opinion, it offers the clearest and most concise description of the model in the context of organizational management."

Beer countered that analogy gave way to the scientific method when scientists moved from identifying conceptually similar behaviors in managerial and biological systems and toward the creation of a rigorous model of invariant behavior that could apply to both. He writes: “The generalized system that comes out of this process, which applies to all systems of a particular class, is a scientific model. . . . The generalization of some behavior invariably and invariantly exhibited by the system as interpreted through this systemic model we usually call law.” Beer conceded that this model could not be proved, it could only be falsified. However, it could be refined through its repeated application to new viable systems. Beer, “The Viable System Model,” 137."

Despite the model’s biological origins, Beer maintained that the abstraction of the structure could be applied in numerous contexts, including the firm, the body, and the state. In keeping with Beer’s emphasis on [[Performance]] rather than representation, it was not a model that accurately represented what these systems were; rather, it was a model that described how these systems behaved. The Viable System Model functioned recursively: the parts of a viable system were also viable, and their behavior could be described using the Viable System Model. Beer explains: “The whole is always encapsulated in each part. . . . This is a lesson learned from biology where we find the genetic blue-print of the whole organism in every cell.”83 Thus, Beer maintained that the state, the company, the worker, and the cell all exhibit the same series of structural relationships."

It offered a balance between centralized and decentralized control that prevented both the tyranny of authoritarianism and the chaos of total freedom. Beer considered viable systems to be largely self-organizing. Therefore, the model sought to maximize the autonomy of its component parts so that they could organize themselves as they saw fit. At the same time, it retained channels for vertical control to maintain the stability of the whole system. These aspects of the Viable System Model shaped the design of Project Cybersyn and provide another illustration of how Beer and Popular Unity were exploring similar approaches to the problem of control."

However, Beer hinted at this level in Brain of the Firm with his description of the parasympathetic nervous system. The Viable System Model can be difficult to understand at first, especially in its biological form. Beer wrote a trilogy of books to explain the model: Brain of the Firm (1972), Heart of the Enterprise (1979), and Diagnosing the System for Organizations (1985). Readers who want to learn more about the Viable System Model should start with the third book, Diagnosing the System for Organizations (New York: J. Wiley, 1985). In my opinion, it offers the clearest and most concise description of the model in the context of organizational management."

Vol. 22, no. 4, p. 223–233. [Accessed 1 March 2023]. DOI 10.1007/s11213-009-9126-z. Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model is the best known of the many cybernetic models he constructed over a career spanning more than 50 years. He explored the necessary conditions for viability in any complex system whether an organism, an organization or a country. Although the model was first applied in his work in the steel industry, many further applications were made during his later work as a consultant. The best known of these was when he was invited by President Salvadore Allende of Chile in 1970 to model the social economy of that country. That experiment was brutally cut short in 1973 by the CIA assisted coup during which Allende was killed and Pinochet’s dictatorship installed. The model itself draws on mathematics, psychology, biology, neurophysiology, communication theory, anthropology and philosophy. It was first expressed in mathematical terms in ‘The Cybernetic Factory’; next it was described in neurophysiological terms in Brain of the firm; and finally according to logic and graphic presentation in Heart of Enterprise and Diagnosing the System for Organizations. This last version is the one that is most accessible. It enables people to address organizational issues in a way that skirts the usual categories and organization charts and gets down to the actual necessary functions, no matter who is performing them. With this model people can get a boost as they diagnose or design an organizations. One aspect is to discover what the organization’s critical variables are and to find or install the homeostats that will show that they are maintaining equilibrium. Within that context, the model will help you ascertain that the principle functions and communications channels are in place and can function effectively. A crucial aspect of the VSM is that it is recursive; that is that the same relationships can be traced from the shop floor to the corporation or from the village to the country. Two examples will be discussed: a small business and the Chilean work from the 1970s. It is hoped that this will encourage people to imagine a world that works much better than it does now and where management is not defeated by complexity.\n"

At the same time, it retained channels for vertical control to maintain the stability of the whole system.

Vol. 22, no. 4, p. 223–233. [Accessed 1 March 2023]. DOI 10.1007/s11213-009-9126-z. Stafford Beer’s Viable System Model is the best known of the many cybernetic models he constructed over a career spanning more than 50 years. He explored the necessary conditions for viability in any complex system whether an organism, an organization or a country. Although the model was first applied in his work in the steel industry, many further applications were made during his later work as a consultant. The best known of these was when he was invited by President Salvadore Allende of Chile in 1970 to model the social economy of that country. That experiment was brutally cut short in 1973 by the CIA assisted coup during which Allende was killed and Pinochet’s dictatorship installed. The model itself draws on mathematics, psychology, biology, neurophysiology, communication theory, anthropology and philosophy. It was first expressed in mathematical terms in ‘The Cybernetic Factory’; next it was described in neurophysiological terms in Brain of the firm; and finally according to logic and graphic presentation in Heart of Enterprise and Diagnosing the System for Organizations. This last version is the one that is most accessible. It enables people to address organizational issues in a way that skirts the usual categories and organization charts and gets down to the actual necessary functions, no matter who is performing them. With this model people can get a boost as they diagnose or design an organizations. One aspect is to discover what the organization’s critical variables are and to find or install the homeostats that will show that they are maintaining equilibrium. Within that context, the model will help you ascertain that the principle functions and communications channels are in place and can function effectively. A crucial aspect of the VSM is that it is recursive; that is that the same relationships can be traced from the shop floor to the corporation or from the village to the country. Two examples will be discussed: a small business and the Chilean work from the 1970s. It is hoped that this will encourage people to imagine a world that works much better than it does now and where management is not defeated by complexity.\n"
