      "text": "Being a compliant learner refers to a style of learning where students tend to follow instructions and complete tasks without questioning or challenging the content or process. A compliant learner is typically seen as a passive recipient of knowledge who does not actively engage with the material or take an independent approach to learning. They are the ones who have mastered the rules of the [[Game of School]].\n\nCompliant learners tend to do well in traditional educational settings, as they are adept at following rules and procedures, and they are generally able to produce the desired results. However, this style of learning may limit their ability to develop critical thinking skills and to apply knowledge in real-world contexts.\n\nCompliance can be a useful skill in some situations, such as in certain types of jobs or roles that require strict adherence to rules and procedures. However, in a rapidly changing and complex world, the ability to think critically, problem-solve, and apply knowledge in new and innovative ways is becoming increasingly important.\n\nTherefore, it is important to encourage learners to develop a more active and independent approach to learning. This may involve providing opportunities for self-directed learning, critical thinking exercises, and project-based learning, as well as encouraging learners to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and develop a deeper understanding of the material. By doing so, students can develop the skills they need to succeed in a rapidly changing world, and become active, engaged, and independent learners."
