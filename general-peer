The popularity of a YouTube video or a Google Scholar profile is not, and cannot be, measured by the authenticity or sincerity of the individual responses to it but only by the aggregated number of clicks or the citation metrics it boasts. The statistical data generated by posts and profiles do not tell us what anyone in particular thinks or has thought. They are not, literally, “artificial intelligence” but rather, as [[Elena Esposito]] says, “[[Artificial Communication]].” They show what happens in society rather than in the mind. Similarly, the general peer is not constituted by individuals and their particular ideas or feelings; it is, instead, a collective communicative performance. It can be measured in data, but it does not reflect personal consciousness."

      "text": "If you have ever seen American Idol or a similar a talent show on TV, you watched the general peer in action—in the form of a jury of celebrities guiding and shaping public taste. Such jurors are “real”—after all, it’s a reality show—but they all participate in a staged public performance. Nothing about them is simply authentic or sincere. They act out their TV personas as a “front stage” theatric representation of the general peer, consisting of different genders, races, and temperaments. In this function they cooperate with the studio audience typically seen behind them. Together, the judges and the audience display approval and disapproval of the contestants. They symbolically manifest a wider and more dynamic dimension of the general peer. The judges in conjunction with the studio audience invite those who watch the show at home to join in with them. Via the staged judges and studio audience, TV viewers can enter the picture and unite with the general peer. A talent show is a public performance that enables anyone to align themselves with the general peer and engage in a staged form of mass profilicity. The general peer remains anonymous to the actual contestants, and the contestants present only a public profile of themselves while remaining personally unrelated to the general peer."

When judging musical performances on American Idol, the American Idol general peer has to be imagined. When reviewing a paper submission for an academic journal, one is asked to envision the academic general peer. In fact, journal editors often remind their reviewers of this. You should check your personal biases and instead adhere to the expected standards of your research community. These standards, however, are hardly ever concretely defined since the general peer, being an abstraction, defies concreteness. The Review of Contemporary Philosophy explicitly acknowledges the power of the abstract general academic peer by stipulating to potential contributors that it will accept only papers promising decent publication metrics: “This journal considers only manuscripts having a high integrative value in the current Scopus- and Web of Science-indexed literature.”"

They act out their TV personas as a “front stage” theatric representation of the general peer, consisting of different genders, races, and temperaments. In this function they cooperate with the studio audience typically seen behind them. Together, the judges and the audience display approval and disapproval of the contestants. They symbolically manifest a wider and more dynamic dimension of the general peer. The judges in conjunction with the studio audience invite those who watch the show at home to join in with them. Via the staged judges and studio audience, TV viewers can enter the picture and unite with the general peer. A talent show is a public performance that enables anyone to align themselves with the general peer and engage in a staged form of mass profilicity. The general peer remains anonymous to the actual contestants, and the contestants present only a public profile of themselves while remaining personally unrelated to the general peer."

When judging musical performances on American Idol, the American Idol general peer has to be imagined. When reviewing a paper submission for an academic journal, one is asked to envision the academic general peer. In fact, journal editors often remind their reviewers of this. You should check your personal biases and instead adhere to the expected standards of your research community. These standards, however, are hardly ever concretely defined since the general peer, being an abstraction, defies concreteness. The Review of Contemporary Philosophy explicitly acknowledges the power of the abstract general academic peer by stipulating to potential contributors that it will accept only papers promising decent publication metrics: “This journal considers only manuscripts having a high integrative value in the current Scopus- and Web of Science-indexed literature.”"
