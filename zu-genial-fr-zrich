Patient Dölf Bachmann, who is the same age, is lying on an X-ray table in front of the thirty-eight-year-old doctor – and Grüntzig inserts his invention into his heart, or more precisely into the delicate vessel that supplies the left part of the heart muscle with oxygen. It is a tiny balloon and marks the beginning of a medical revolution. At the same time, it escalates the conflict with his Swiss superiors, who do everything they can to keep Grüntzig down. The German doctor will not grow old, but his Swiss patient is still alive today."

He gets on his racing bike in Kreis 6 and gets off again a few minutes later at Haldenbachplatz. His face is a little red from the wind, who knows, maybe a little excited, because he is about to see for the first time what he has been researching for eleven years. Barton's main job is as a doctor and professor of cardiology at the University of Zurich. But he has spent most of his free time in recent years trying to create a memento of his German compatriot that does him justice."

But today, for the first time, Maria Schlumpf wants to bring the original catheters of yesteryear and the utensils used to make them. \"The balloons from back then are sacred to her,\" whispers Barton, an athletic man in his mid-fifties who exudes youthful enthusiasm. Then Maria Schlumpf stands in front of him, short white hair, silk top with a leopard print, a smart older lady who doesn't give away her age. They greet each other in a friendly manner."
