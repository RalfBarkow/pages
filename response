The simplest case of such a resonance relationship is in the exchange of a glance or in a dialogue in which the two speakers hear and respond to each other reciprocally. **Eyes are windows of resonance**; to look someone in the eye and feel their returning gaze is to enter into resonance with them – unless we block ourselves from doing so by repelling them with a hostile stare or ignoring them with a dull gaze. Then we are in a state of [[Alienation]], that is, in a relational mode of indifference or hostility."

Of course, we experience ourselves as self-effective and touched at the same time not only in interpersonal contact, but also, for example, when we learn to play a musical instrument, jump into the ocean and swim or bake a loaf of bread. In a more subtle sense, we can also speak of self-efficacy when we not only read a book, but begin to *process* it."
