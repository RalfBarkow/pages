More specifically, this notation is a [[Bipartite Graph]] – A bipartite graph has two disjoint sets of vertices, where every graph edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other. – G = (C, B, K) in which components C represent one graph vertex set (rectangles), event-based buses B represent the second graph vertex set (ovals), and connector graph edges"
