And this is not only a substitute for touching with the hands, it is also a protection against what touching could bring. If you think that all that you see there would really be felt by you, you would already be in jail. There is no stop, there is no stopping. And then you realize that you are not only changing space: you can go into the infinity of space with drawings, but also that you are changing time. Because you are only holding on to a moment, but it is not lost, it is now in the drawing. That is, time suddenly opens up as a process from which you can never get out. And every drawing holds stations in this process, and – and this is now the decisive thing, this is what your sentences have alluded to – it is the case that we cannot come to terms with what we know to be in us, and this not coming to terms with it always promotes the view of the drawing and also promotes the fact that the drawings run in series over decades. Again and again it is the – to take Sigmund Freud's term – unconscious, which draws along and which uses the drawing to become conscious to a certain extent. And that means at the same time, starting from there, also sowing a little bit of enlightenment, pursuing, so to speak, to recognize as that which gives us an identity in the first place and which is also able to give an identity to the species to which we belong, the species of the human being as a driving force. So, the small drawings on the back cover, for example, of a cardboard box that you fish out of your pocket: in them, you deal with the human species. You can start again and again, break off - it's the same. Your drawings belong in space and time, in fact, where you can change both. And that is the real impetus, which we may expect already in early childhood doodles, that we do not hop from one now to another now, and at each now we are practically out of the world, but we first open up the world.\n"
