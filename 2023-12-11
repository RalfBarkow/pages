Had he asked a single week before my brain would not have have had the capacity to ever consider it, but his timing was perfect and now we are focused on XR above other media, for the time being, with AI being a building block in that environment. Since he works at Apple on webXR for visionOS he as deep knowledge and our work further reliance. Thank you Brandel for adding this dimension to the work.\n\nAnd then there is everyone who is part of the future of text community to some capacity: THANK YOU!\n\nSo to accelerate, I thank you for being a part of this and ask you; how can we become an even more inclusive community? How can we take it further?\n\nWe have three goals this year:\n\nDialog: Symposium, Lab and Book\nXR Software: Read and interact with documents and Libraries in XR\nMetadata: Work on the best way to include, retain and use the metadata which makes the interactions possible\n\nPlease think of where you might want to make a contribution and who else you think we should invite in. Please note that the money is a good amount but very little is discretionary, what the grant allows us to do is to spend more money on everything we are doing (no longer out of pocket and Vint Cerf’s generous contributions!) and to invest in professional XR coding. What it primarily gives us as a community is some recognition which will make it easier to connect with more people and more kinds of people.\n\nI thank you again,\n\nFrode Alexander Hegland"
