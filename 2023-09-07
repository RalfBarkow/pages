Further, the OOP framework represents a human conception about the human conception of the world, and in that sense, it is the outcome of a recursive analysis that exemplifies first and second-order cybernetics and systems theory (Bateson G., 2002; Checkland P., 1999; Foerster von H., 1984; 2002; 2003; Heidegger M., 2006; Heylighen F., 2001; Maturana H.R., 2005). In fact, the only thing that OOP lacks compared to the human conception of reality is embodiment; but here too, if one considers software as residing in hardware (a legitimate conception in our opinion), the embodiment of software becomes a self-evident fact. It should be therefore of no surprise that we are proposing systems theory as a theoretical framework for software engineering in all of its aspects."

In: 2010 International Conference on Technology for Education. July 2010. p. 122–129. DOI 10.1109/T4E.2010.5550047. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5550047 page]  Making the experience of e-learning more effective requires interactive and collaborative systems to be adaptive and customizable. Specialized learning systems tend to be monolithic and difficult to extend. We present an alternative approach, where we synthesize a customizable learning environment from existing tools (Trac, SVN, reST, SQLite). The system presents the student not just with content, but an [[immersive]] experience that allows both individual and group annotations, versioning of the student’s work, custom querying, and a uniform markup language to store content. We report the motivation and design of such an environment. We demonstrate the use of this system and its ability to plug into other environments by showcasing a custom interactive workbook, built for teaching and learning the principles of programming."
