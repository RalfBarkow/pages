Further, the OOP framework represents a human conception about the human conception of the world, and in that sense, it is the outcome of a recursive analysis that exemplifies first and second-order cybernetics and systems theory (Bateson G., 2002; Checkland P., 1999; Foerster von H., 1984; 2002; 2003; Heidegger M., 2006; Heylighen F., 2001; Maturana H.R., 2005). In fact, the only thing that OOP lacks compared to the human conception of reality is embodiment; but here too, if one considers software as residing in hardware (a legitimate conception in our opinion), the embodiment of software becomes a self-evident fact. It should be therefore of no surprise that we are proposing systems theory as a theoretical framework for software engineering in all of its aspects."
