These are not at odds, but do call for recognition and mutuality; and systematically *generated* mutuality, intentional practices of mutualising, evolving into kin.\n"

But I’m in no doubt - given my differing, melancholic reality - that his sanguine optimism needs to be set alongside, and recognised and understood alongside, and mobilised alongside . . other temperaments, other formations of the heart-mind; under a regime of ‘practice-and-theory of mind’ that underpins the cultivating of skilful practices of *aware* intention, affiliation, perception, deep time.\n\n"

In the body: it could not possibly be *more* material - akin to the practice of an Olympic floor-exercise gymnast! \n"
