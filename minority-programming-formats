      "text": "The studies conducted by Haring (1975) and Rogers and Woodbury (1996) aimed to examine the level of radio format choices in local radio markets and the impact of an increase in the number of stations on programming diversity. Haring used Levin's index of diversity and found that a relatively large number of competing signals, about 20 or more, is required to generate minority programming formats in the advertiser-supported system. Rogers and Woodbury also supported this conclusion and found that a 10% increase in the number of stations would only result in a 2% increase in the number of formats. These findings confirmed the Steiner hypothesis, but it is important to note the differences in the market environment of the local radio industry."

This article addresses the issue of market structure in the top 50 radio markets and the different types of program diversity measures. The Study used a secondary analysis of ownership information, format information, and song information to analyze the research questions and hypotheses. Overall, the study confirmed previous research related to an increase in format diversity with an increase in the number of competitors. Likewise, the research related to an increase in [[Format Diversity]] with an increase in the number of competitors. Likewise the findings showed a negative relationship between ownership concentration and radio program diversity.\n"
