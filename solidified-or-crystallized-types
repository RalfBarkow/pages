In his opinion, it is not justified for sociology to categorically distinguish, for example, (a) a legal or moral norm and (b) the type of a dwelling – because in both cases it is a matter of typically solidified or crystallized types (*Arten*) of social action, from which the same determining, objectified constraints emanate on the shaping of individual life, against which a mere individual decision of will is practically powerless."
