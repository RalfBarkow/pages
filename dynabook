Of course, this is an early sketch from [[Alan Kay]], it has to provide resources for communication for collaboration and visualization. It should draw on the human senses for touching and seeing and hearing for input and output as forms of communications including or especially for self-reflection. Educationally it should support the learner's ability to create models working individually or collaboratively and those models should be about both the physical and social worlds, both real and imaginary to test the learners thinking about those worlds."

Keeping Software Development and Scientific Research as two separated activities limits the quality of the former and the applicability of the latter. We describe an approach to scientific research and software development that builds on the ideas and practices of Experimental Mathematics, and best practices in Software Development, and results in an integrated process and tools. The result is a body of knowledge that satisfies the requirements to be considered serious research, and provides useful building blocks for real world software applications."
