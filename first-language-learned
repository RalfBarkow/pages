It had some advanced commands to provide other ways to alter memory than singular POKEs and PEEKs, often eliminating the need for in-line machine language routines that did the same thing in more inefficient and obfuscated ways.

She had to pull out the language reference to look up some of the keywords I used. (Tell me, just WHAT is wrong with using DEFSTR?) And then, well, let's just say that technically I don't know Java. I've never studied it. AP exams got me out of taking Intro to Programming in college, and they taught Java in that class.

So I used CBM BASIC and 6502 assembly. I had to learn [[Pascal Language]] for Comp-Sci in High School. Going from free-form BASIC to structured Pascal was refreshing and freeing, as I could finally do some of the things I always wanted but never had the means to. At my first full-time software job, between stretching Lotus 1-2-3 macros and dBASE III scripts to their limits, I learned [[Cee Language]] - on the first Unix box I ever had access to - as well as a little shell programming. Unfortunately, I didn't get much of a chance to use it, but by that time, it was [[Just Another Programming Language]]. I went to school to learn EE -- they forced me to learn [[Fortran Language]] - and on my first co-op migrated to [[Embedded System]]s work using C and 6800 assembly. Somewhere in there I picked up a little [[Forth Language]] and [[Post Script]], though I never did any serious hacking with either. Learning [[Object Oriented]] principles was as freeing as learning [[Structured Programming]]. And so I learned [[Cee Plus Plus]], [[Perl Language]], [[Java Language]], and so forth. -- [[Tim King]]]",

It had some advanced commands to provide other ways to alter memory than singular POKEs and PEEKs, often eliminating the need for in-line machine language routines that did the same thing in more inefficient and obfuscated ways. It was also three times faster than Atari BASIC, and almost completely backwards-compatible. There was even a compiler to make programs even faster.

So he pulled out a 5.25\" floppy, formatted it, copied on PRODOS and BASIC.SYSTEM, and gave me the manuals. I twiddled with Pascal some (got started with that the same way -- asked my dad. It was TML Pascal, and I never did figure out how to use its much-touted graphics capabilities) but I never really learned enough to make use of the language. Lack of GOTO confused me at the time. QBasic on a 386 following that, then Visual Basic 2.0 on a 486 following that, upgrading to 3 and 6 in later years. Somewhere in there I learned some 6502/6510 assembler. C++ in high school, mIRC scripting (hey, that's some powerful stuff), TI-BASIC and Z80 assembler (for a TI-86) on my own after that, and last year I added Scheme to my list of languages. While we're sharing anecdotes, I've got a couple. I had to take a BASIC course in high school as a prerequisite to the C++ class. (They let me skip the Intro to BASIC class, but Structured Programming in BASIC was still required.) I went in knowing more about BASIC than my teacher did. She had to pull out the language reference to look up some of the keywords I used. (Tell me, just WHAT is wrong with using DEFSTR?) And then, well, let's just say that technically I don't know Java. I've never studied it. AP exams got me out of taking Intro to Programming in college, and they taught Java in that class.

The game used a sort of stack machine assembler, like Forth without any introspection, and as a leveling mechanism each robot only could execute a fixed number of opcodes per time step. There was an annual [[Robo War]] tournament, all entries to be included in the next release of [[Robo War]] so people could see how the winners ticked and evolve their strategy. One of my Hypercard creations was a utility to translate infix math formulas into postfix, to help me write Robocode. I think it actually was trying to be a recursive-descent parser, though I didn't know that at the time.",
