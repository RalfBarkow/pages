The articles focus on different subprocesses in academic self-regulation such as those involved in the self-system, metacognitive functioning, self-verbalization, instructional context management, and socialization of children. Basic research and theory on each process is considered, and a field study indicating a strong relationship between student use of self-regulated learning strategies and their academic achievement is briefly described. It is concluded that self-regulated learning theories have much potential for guiding research on student study patterns and for assisting students to become more self-reliant and effective a learners.

      "text": "In a recent interview study (Zimmerman & Pons. in press), it was found that high school students’ use of 14 categories of self-regulated learning strategies during class and study was highly related to their academic achievement. These strategies included self-evaluation, organizing and transforming, subgoal setting and planning, seeking information, keeping records and self-monitoring, environmental structuring, self-consequences, rehearsing and memorizing, seeking peer, teacher, or adult assistance, reviewing notes, tests, or text books. Eighty students were asked to describe the methods they used in six learning contexts and to rate their consistency in using each method. Reported use of these strategies proved to be highly correlated with academic achievement: Students’ placement in advanced versus other achievement tracks in their school was predicted with 93% accuracy. Students in the two achievement groups differed significantly in their mention of nearly all categories of self-regulation. These results indicated clearly that high school students’ use of metacognitive strategies were highly related to their achievement level. "

The global self-structure is postulated to serve as both a filter through which all information is introduced and also as an executive planner of such subordinate processes as self-awareness and self-evaluation. In turn, these processes are theorized to affect students’ percepts of self-competence ranging from global to specific. This causal model appears best suited for explaining such general measures of student functioning as their attitudes and achievement in school. **An attractive feature of the McCombs model is that it links previous research on general notions of self as an *agent* and as an *object*** and more contextually relative notions of self-functioning such as self-efficacy, self-monitoring, and self-evaluation within a single overarching framework. \n\nCorno (1986) focuses her paper on two of the most fascinating topics in self-regulation: the role of attention and volition. These processes are fascinating because we know accomplished people can perform tasks with little attention to the motoric details that befuddle the rest of us, allowing them to focus their energies instead on the more strategic dimensions. Corno’s paper is helpful because it identifies some of the specific conditions that can interfere with students’ volitional control during learning, such as competing action tendencies, peer pressures, and degree of “state” (versus action) orientation as defined by Kuhl (1983).\n"

He discusses the Soviet theoretical basis for the hypothesis that private speech improves ones self-control (Vygotsky, 1962). Research on overt verbalization, or “self-instruction” as it is often called, has blossomed from initial interest in the role of children’s general verbalizations to an interest in their qualitative form. Schunk’s recommendation that the effects of overt verbalization on such specific subprocesses as attention, retention, positive task outlook, and self-efficacy be examined seems not only theoretically useful but also heuristically important. \n"

      "text": "He cautions us that the influence of verbalization are far more complex than the Soviets originally theorized. For example, verbalization can interfere with as well as enhance learning (Denny, 197.5;Zimmerman & Bell, 1972). Indeed, there have been many failures by Western psychologists to replicate the verbal enhancement results initially reported by the Soviets (Roberts & Dick, 1982). However, these replication efforts have often altered the timing of verbalization during training: Western researchers have typically prompted their subjects to verbalize before or during motoric acquisition, whereas, the Soviets prompted verbalization after motoric facility was acquired. There is some evidence that when verbalization is delayed until after motoric acquisition, it facilitates learning, but if verbalization is required during motoric acquisition, learning is impeded (Higa, Tharp, & Caukins, 1978). These data imply that verbalization might facilitate performance if it serves a cuing function rather than a storage function (Roberts & Dick, 1982).\n"

      "text": "According to Schunk’s suggested framework, verbalization may facilitate students’ use of attention processes more than, perhaps, retention processes. At the present, it seems most appropriate to conclude that verbalization and such other psychological subprocesses as attention and motoric performance function as separate “streams” that can mutually influence each other under certain conditions (Roberts, 1979). Schunk’s proposed analysis would appear to be particularly well-suited for sorting out these issues."

This model has the advantage of explaining what learners *do* as well as what they *bring* personally to the classroom setting. The model directs researchers’ attention to the very important issue of how classroom environments sponsor or impede self-regulated learning by students, and it identifies the teacher, the instructional program, and the setting as relevant variables for researchers’ consideration. Furthermore, the model seeks to explain the influence of such individual characteristics of learners as their prior achievement, temperament, demographic status, as well as their domain-general and domain-specific subject matter knowledge on their ability to be self-instuctive. \n"

To test their self-regulation model. Wang and Peverly have undertaken an ambitious program of research using teachers and students in a substantial number of experimental classrooms. Most research on self-regulated learning has been conducted with children who have been removed from their classrooms to participate in what Bronfrenbrenner (1979) might call unusual tasks in an unnatural settings with strangers. Many of the complex interactions postulated by self-regulation theorists may be observable only in ecologically complex environments such as experimental classrooms. The Wang and Peverly model is designed specifically to explore the role of classroom context on student self-regulated learning.\n"

The Soviet view of childrens’ self-regulation posits a central role for socialization processes using such constructs as “scaffolding” and “zone of proximal development.” Self-regulation in the form of instructions and motoric strategies are transferred from the parent to the child during dyadic encounters using such instructional techniques as modeling, guided practice, and verbal instruction. The adult gradually withdraws support as the child internalizes the self-regulatory functions.\n"

Implicit in this account are assumptions about the importance of the relationship between children and their socializing agent (and analogously between students and their teachers). […]"

The global self-structure is postulated to serve as both a filter through which all information is introduced and also as an executive planner of such subordinate processes as self-awareness and self-evaluation. In turn, these processes are theorized to affect students’ percepts of self-competence ranging from global to specific. This causal model appears best suited for explaining such general measures of student functioning as their attitudes and achievement in school. **An attractive feature of the McCombs model is that it links previous research on general notions of self as an *agent* and as an *object*** and more contextually relative notions of self-functioning such as self-efficacy, self-monitoring, and self-evaluation within a single overarching framework. \n\nCorno (1986) focuses her paper on two of the most fascinating topics in self-regulation: the role of attention and volition. These processes are fascinating because we know accomplished people can perform tasks with little attention to the motoric details that befuddle the rest of us, allowing them to focus their energies instead on the more strategic dimensions. Corno’s paper is helpful because it identifies some of the specific conditions that can interfere with students’ volitional control during learning, such as competing action tendencies, peer pressures, and degree of “state” (versus action) orientation as defined by Kuhl (1983).\n"

For example, verbalization can interfere with as well as enhance learning (Denny, 197.5;Zimmerman & Bell, 1972). Indeed, there have been many failures by Western psychologists to replicate the verbal enhancement results initially reported by the Soviets (Roberts & Dick, 1982). However, these replication efforts have often altered the timing of verbalization during training: Western researchers have typically prompted their subjects to verbalize before or during motoric acquisition, whereas, the Soviets prompted verbalization after motoric facility was acquired. There is some evidence that when verbalization is delayed until after motoric acquisition, it facilitates learning, but if verbalization is required during motoric acquisition, learning is impeded (Higa, Tharp, & Caukins, 1978). These data imply that verbalization might facilitate performance if it serves a cuing function rather than a storage function (Roberts & Dick, 1982)."

        "text": "According to Schunk’s suggested framework, verbalization may facilitate students’ use of attention processes more than, perhaps, retention processes. At the present, it seems most appropriate to conclude that verbalization and such other psychological subprocesses as attention and motoric performance function as separate “streams” that can mutually influence each other under certain conditions (Roberts, 1979). Schunk’s proposed analysis would appear to be particularly well-suited for sorting out these issues."
