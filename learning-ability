One can do something with the positive value (for example truth), but also with the negative value (for example untruth). Indeed, only the positive value is connectable in the system, but the negative value can specify under which conditions (here: theories) this is the case. Binary coded systems are therefore always self-dynamic, autopoietic systems, which can never bring about their own end with their own operations. Since this condition is not given for educators, they tend to think teleologically â€“ be it that they reach their goals, be it that they have to weaken them or even give them up as unattainable in individual cases. In any case, educational efforts eventually come to an end."

In addition, organization ensures that they will be enrolled in school and show up on time for classes. There is no doubt that a new class for school beginners can be set up next year, and organization can also be used to adjust to demographic fluctuations. The fact that children are born at all is assumed to be so certain that the educational system does not have to adjust to the loss of complete birth cohorts and thus does not have to describe itself as environmentally determined.

It is true that this dependence on organization under the name of \"bureaucracy\" is an ongoing annoyance for educators interested in children (and not only in their \"places\"); but these are then, as it were, the costs of the structurally enforced renunciation of binary coding. While other functional systems differentiate themselves via binary coding and have to introduce organization (for instance in the form of production companies, state administrations, sports clubs, courts, museums, etc.) only at a systematically later point, only as a condition for sufficient complexity (and then admittedly also become dependent on it), in the case of the educational system the differentiation itself is dependent on organization."

Also missing is any parallel to those highly developed forms of economic rationality which result from the reduction to the decision about payments or their omission at given prices. The rationality defect, which is conspicuous in comparison with the money medium, is then all too quickly compensated for by emphasis, exuberance and disappointment. Above all, this difference explains the high interaction intensity of education, compared to the extremely reduced forms of interaction that the money economy needs at best. Seen in this comparison, the media defects of education must be compensated by interaction among those present; and by interaction because this is the only appropriate form of dealing with \"children\"."

It seems that for such an evolution the development of specific communication media is an indispensable condition, because how else could system-specific form differences arise and be assigned to the respective functions? In all these cases, the differentiation typology of modern society is realized; and only the way in which this is made possible varies from functional system to functional system."

One can do something with the positive value (for example truth), but also with the negative value (for example untruth). Indeed, only the positive value is connectable in the system, but the negative value can specify under which conditions (here: theories) this is the case. Binary coded systems are therefore always self-dynamic, autopoietic systems, which can never bring about their own end with their own operations. Since this condition is not given for educators, they tend to think teleologically - be it that they reach their goals, be it that they have to weaken them or even give them up as unattainable in individual cases. In any case, educational efforts eventually come to an end."
