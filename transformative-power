He collaborates in the ideas phase, often needing to voice his ideas and share his grand plans before diving into ‘the zone’ and tinkering in isolation. His deep curiosity drives his speed; he’s hungry to solve, to create, to innovate and there’s no stopping him once he gets started. He learns in an innate way. "

He was likely [[The Curious Child]] who poked and prodded in the times when you were supposed to be silent and compliant. After school, he followed the expected path and got a job but it wasn’t until his early 30s that he left the mundane behind and started his first business employing his innovative mind. "

He is what I aspire to reveal in learners, that authentic thirst and hidden voice. Through reflecting on myself and my dad as learners, I have come to appreciate more deeply how valuable being seen is. There's such power in being seen and heard, for it is then that we might be transformed.  It is then that we might begin to tell ourselves a different story about ourselves; a new [[Narrative Identity]] might begin to emerge."

        "text": "When I was at university and then when teaching in the classroom, I often thought of my dad and his learning. The way it ignites his soul. I still do. He is what I aspire to reveal in learners, that authentic thirst and hidden voice. Through reflecting on myself and my dad as learners, I have come to appreciate more deeply how valuable being seen is. There's such power in being seen and heard, for it is then that we might be transformed.  It is then that we might begin to tell ourselves a different story about ourselves; a new [[Narrative Identity]] emerges."

        "text": "My dad attended the local boys grammar school at a time when a new narrative wasn’t even a blip on the horizon. He tells me he ‘did okay’ at school but didn’t really enjoy it. He was likely [[The Curious Child]] who poked and prodded in the times when you were supposed to be silent and compliant. After school, he followed the expected path and got a job but it wasn’t until his early 30s that he left the mundane behind and started his first business employing his innovative mind. "
