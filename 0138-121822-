Ward was demonstrating a query-wiki mechanism for pages of interest, with a couple of focused collaboration cases\nfirst one was collaboration over a locality based storytelling with images; second driving case was collaboration over the Supercollaborator for drawing maps of connected systems\nThere was also a sidebar about generated text and images as plausibly familiar but not adding any meaning\nbut useful as a creative producer's assistant, useful for plausible content embedded in games, maybe handy for freelance writers writing to \"x words on topic y\"\na personal health record for collaboration among other patients with common interests / with ground-level practitioners? [though this is three-dynamite-sticks danger for legal liability]\noh I should have captured a screenshot maybe of the indexing to purpose demo?\n\"who owns the problem?\" (my continuing toothache at my Microsoft job)\n(Marc and Ward discuss collaborating over connected data)\nFrom Paul Rodwell to Everyone:1:47 PM\nflat file database, with JSON files - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat-file_database\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:1:49 PM\nMarc: \"a realtime instance of a property graph database that you essentially start from scratch every day\"\nWard: \"on a page, we might have a dozen or two dozen relationships, that's a diagram we could draw and examine. Bigger than that, you have to add some technology. If you're willing to wait seconds, you could pull in tens of thousands of relationships.\"\nAt New Relic, there were half a million relationships, and that was not enough to even bother with adding an index to the property graph database.\nFrom Robert Best to Everyone:1:49 PM\nif I wanted to compute the betweenness metric for all nodes inna wiki graph... better to do something like that in a wiki script from scratch, or at some point it makes sense to shift larger data into something like neo4j for that?\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:1:50 PM\nRobert: yes, that's the interesting question; most wikis are small enough that \"cache a map or a query result, update it in bits\" is a plausible approach\nHappy birthday Marc!\nFrom Peter Dimitrios... to Everyone:1:51 PM\nðŸŽ‚\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:1:51 PM\nplusieurs joyeuses retours de l'anniversÃ©e!\nFrom Me to Everyone:1:52 PM\ncan you zoom in?\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:1:53 PM\nSeeing Like An International Aid Organization (to Marc's graph)\nlike \"The Careless Society\" -- when does \"helping\" hurt?\nFrom Paul Rodwell to Everyone:1:53 PM\njustifying their existence by making reliant on their service\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:1:55 PM\nright -- there are no lines between aid and grift once there exists a driving organization or a pipeline of multiple handoffs from here to there\n(nod, nod, nod) - to Ward's point about \"if I understand how to administer capital, I can see where I'd put it\"\nversus \"if I was the person experiencing limits and trouble, what things are important to me?\" (with a focus of increasing power of choice, of autonomy)\nFrom Me to Everyone:1:56 PM\nwho famously said \"there is no baby\"\nbecause whenever you think of a baby there's other people involved\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:1:56 PM\nI don't recall who said that. I'm trying to recall who was it had the Twitter banner, \"Autonomy is my drug of choice\".\nwhenever you think of a baby there is a set of caring and supply relationships\nFrom Me to Everyone:1:57 PM\nok but imagine a teen mom saying that\nshe'd be a terrorist!\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:1:58 PM\nhmm the teen mom would look at where the pain points were\nand would maybe like to be less arm-wrestling with the folks directly in her environment\nand have some breathing space to think about options\nso \"respite care\" ends up important for caregivers, for giving them space for being a person in context\nFrom Me to Everyone:1:58 PM\ni think a lot of teen moms are really celebrated and it's what happens later that is harder\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:1:58 PM\nother than the person attached to the baby\noh right, say four years on, six years on, etc etc\nFrom Me to Everyone:1:58 PM\nyou get seen for the first time-- by the state, by your family, you're way more important than at your shitty job, even god likes you\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:1:59 PM\noh right oh right it's a pattern, \"at least THIS matters\"\nand then eight years later it's just a struggle, unless your circumstances have changed a lot\nFrom Me to Everyone:2:00 PM\nbut i think it's an antipattern to associate female sexuality with pain, unable to imagine without consequences. it doesn't seem fair.\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:2:01 PM\nremembering some examples of teen moms who adopted out\nJoni Mitchell\nYes, it is absolutely unfair.\nand we're stuck in some of those unfairnesses due to policy priorities\nFrom Me to Everyone:2:02 PM\nhahaha an amazing euphemism for patriarchy\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:2:02 PM\nalso teen moms who didn't adopt out. I think Quinn Norton had enough family support to make a go with her daughter in changing circumstances\nwell yeah but not limited to patriarchy, also a punishment and compliance based morality, looking for blame rather than looking for harm reduction\nFrom Me to Everyone:2:03 PM\nthat doesn't come from girls, we're evil in kind of boring ways\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:2:03 PM\nNils, Elikn, Thor, Sten, Linda (the researchers, students, publications graph)\ncompliance based morality is absolutely a girl thing in ingroups / outgroups -- you can't be friends with her\nFrom Me to Everyone:2:04 PM\nthat's a way of being friends\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:2:04 PM\nthough maybe it's not the same structure;\nFrom Jeff Miller to Me: (Direct Message)2:04 PM\nsidebar away from general chat\nFrom Me to Jeff Miller: (Direct Message)2:05 PM\noh i liked that feminist takeover heh heh\nFrom Jeff Miller to Me: (Direct Message)2:05 PM\nlike the Commander's Wife in the patriarchal dystopia\n:)\nFrom Me to Jeff Miller: (Direct Message)2:05 PM\nshe was just relating to men though\nFrom Jeff Miller to Me: (Direct Message)2:05 PM\nit's so obvious as an ongoing trouble generator\nFrom Me to Jeff Miller: (Direct Message)2:05 PM\nusing other women to negotiate with ment\nFrom Jeff Miller to Me: (Direct Message)2:05 PM\nyes, and she ends up in a gilded cage\nFrom Me to Jeff Miller: (Direct Message)2:06 PM\ndid you read the book or see the show?\nFrom Jeff Miller to Me: (Direct Message)2:06 PM\nI didn't, only getting little bits second hand.\nbut just before you arrived I was thinking \"bunch of old men\"\nFrom Me to Jeff Miller: (Direct Message)2:06 PM\npeople don't think of it as sci-fi but it's excellent sci fi\nFrom Jeff Miller to Me: (Direct Message)2:06 PM\nexcept Kerri connected through Marc\nFrom Me to Jeff Miller: (Direct Message)2:07 PM\nand karen in background\nFrom Jeff Miller to Me: (Direct Message)2:07 PM\noh absolutely in the social SF sense\nFrom Me to Jeff Miller: (Direct Message)2:07 PM\nthe book has a twist at the end\nFrom Jeff Miller to Me: (Direct Message)2:07 PM\nright the aunties as enforcement\nKerri is constantly mentioned as having strengths in asking generative questions\nFrom Me to Jeff Miller: (Direct Message)2:08 PM\nkerri turner?\nFrom Jeff Miller to Me: (Direct Message)2:08 PM\nwhen trying to understand a system that has trouble points for improvement\nFrom Me to Jeff Miller: (Direct Message)2:08 PM\ni want to learn how to do this\nFrom Jeff Miller to Me: (Direct Message)2:08 PM\nI misremember\nKerry -- there on the screen\nFrom John T. to Everyone:2:08 PM\nI am going to have to go right now but since Marc asked and wanted to catch up I'll type really quick that Chris has set me up with some one who is teaching me how to build a website or playground where we are going to work on a few projects. I am going to be learning and gaining more skills so that I may be more useful and knowledgeable in coding\nFrom Jeff Miller to Me: (Direct Message)2:08 PM\nmaybe ask Marc straight out about Kerry\nyour prompt!\nFrom Me to Jeff Miller: (Direct Message)2:09 PM\nwhich one?\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:2:09 PM\n(long sidebar with Victoria about dysfunctional systems; Victoria was curious about Kerry and her work)\nFrom Me to Everyone:2:09 PM\naccurate\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:2:10 PM\nJohn: thanks for showing up!\nthis is not John Waters the Baltimore director I presume\nFrom Paul Rodwell to Everyone:2:10 PM\nno UK John Waters\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:2:22 PM\n(check!) John Waters, UK\nUrbit leaderboard. :)\nhttp://click.viki.wiki\nleaderboard into a page graph\nmodeling how people behave online\nThe lineup diagram did a credible job of drawing the leaderboard, using the Method plugin.\nVictoria says: I understood the predator-prey graph. I wanted to use something trivial [so I could understand how to model simple data in FedWiki - ?]. The Urbit leaderboard looked like an interesting way to model how people interact where there's nothing at state.\n\"how far up from the bottom do you have to go to summarize the number of clicks at a particular order / [percentile rank]\"\nUrbit will produce planets with two syllables, then moons, then ... so the very long name is probably a comment.\nFederated wiki is the best way to model this dataset\nThis reminds me of the Penumbra Primes competition.\nsyllabic generation of usernames in Urbit\n(I did a Markov chain syllable generator as my first Google App Engine app)\nWard; \"How much of the long tail do we have to add together to match the fat front?\" (%ile ranking?)\nwhere is the median?\nthat's an answer that touches the numbers\nor \"how many of the folks off the bottom do we need to match person X higher up in the leaderboard?\"\nhttp://click.viki.wiki/\n(using a Code paragraph to keep the leaderboard formatted a line at a time)\nFrom Paul Rodwell to Everyone:2:22 PM\nbeen some years since these plugins were looked at.\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:2:28 PM\nthe Method plugin worked well enough to do a demo. Michael M. ran forward for a while\nthe median is one way to look at that summary statistic\n\"half of the total below the line, half above\"\nbut Ward posed the question of \"for a given person in the lineup, how many people off the bottom add up to that person's number\" ?\nsome of the numbers are also quality-based, interestingly\nas base-10 representations\n(now I need to look up \"what is Urbit\")\ngeometric mean (ish)\n\"how much click power at the bottom does it take to get to the top?\"\nInteresting patterns of behavior and motions; interesting narrative in the ledger; significance of numbers; watching the count and going for the number\n\"an even number in log based 2; or a power of 2\"\nRamanujan world!\nhttps://numberproperties.com/562018\n(Macy's advertisement and cookie statement popup for me)\nFrom Robert Best to Everyone:2:28 PM\n720720\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:2:29 PM\nhttp://click.viki.wiki\nrecherche exotica\narcanum\n(raises hand)\nFrom Robert Best to Everyone:2:30 PM\nC S Peirce too\nFrom Jeff Miller to Everyone:2:39 PM\nnumerology; kabbalah;\noh, C S Peirce liked numbers with implicit meaning connections?\nThompson Morrison - wiki haiku three links etc.\ntaking advantage of the hypertext nature\nhere's a paragraph with one carriage return, oops that makes it from six into seven, Markdown sometimes does that\n\"how do you delete a paragraph you can't see? you move a real paragraph underneath it...\"\n\"you can split and join paragraphs\"\n\"Is there a way to work with the [page] JSON directly?\"\nyellow halo\n(unreliable old plugin for JSON)\nimport JSON output into wiki as a collection of pages\nthe slug for the page is the key, the page is a structure of keyvalue pairs\n'jq' can generate JSON, or just a text editor...\n\"test-page\": { \"title\": \"Test Page\", \"story\": [{\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"text\": \"Hello World\"}]}\nomitting the journal, but it should still work\n\"test-page\": { \"title\": \"Test Page\", \"story\": [{\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"text\": \"Hello World\"}]} \"test-page2\": { \"title\": \"Test Page2\", \"story\": [{\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"text\": \"Hello World\"}]}\n[ \"test-page\": { \"title\": \"Test Page\", \"story\": [{\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"text\": \"Hello World\"}]}, \"test-page2\": { \"title\": \"Test Page2\", \"story\": [{\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"text\": \"Hello World\"}]} ]"
