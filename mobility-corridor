One strategy to minimize this cost is a “balanced cut and fill” grade change, rising gently in the urban fabric to the edge of the mobility corridor, and then cut more deeply to accommodate travel lanes at a lower grade. A related strategy is to utilize existing natural watershed grade changes, taking care to avoid water pollution from vehicle emissions and other toxic runoff. Because of the cost of excavation, many cities in recent decades have chosen the easier alternative, which is to raise highways and heavy transport tracks above the pedestrian urban fabric. But the evidence shows that there is a profoundly negative impact of such solutions on the urban life underneath them.²",
