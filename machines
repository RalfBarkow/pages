      "text": "For the first time, machines are participating in communication among humans. Communication has always meant an erratic shift, sometimes a gentle glide (\"glissement\"), between the different perspectives from which the various participants engaged in communication. But now it can no longer be overlooked that the [[Meaning]] of communication is not only processed but also produced by talking, writing, printing, sending and posting people, but also by registering, logging, linking and calculating machines."
