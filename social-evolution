This offered the opportunity for a light-touch theorizing that grounded the assertion of one aspect on the critique of the absoluteness of the other. The intention of the following three parts is to overcome such contrasts. In this respect they form a unity. And they try not only to assert the unity of these contrasts abstractly, but to work them out in theory itself."
