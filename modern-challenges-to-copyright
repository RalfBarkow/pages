      "text": "Copyright concepts are under challenge in the modern era, primarily from the increasing use of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]]. Major copyright holders, such as the major [[record labels]] and the [[major film studios]], blame the ease of copying for their decreasing profits. Alternative explanations have been put forward, such as poor product content and excessive license charges- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_copyright#Modern_challenges_to_copyright wikipedia]"

      "text": "In the United States [[public interest]] groups, major corporations and the like, are entering the public education system to teach the curriculum from their perspectives. The lobbying group for the [[MPAA]] provide a curriculum entitled ''What's the Diff?'' taught by a group of volunteers called Junior Achievement. The [[Business Software Alliance]] also has their own curriculum program called ''Play it Cybersafe'', which is distributed to school children through a magazine called ''[[The Weekly Reader]]''. The American Librarian Association released their own curriculum for librarians that was distributed in the winter of 2004."
