      "text": "## Make Process Policies Explicit\nUntil the mechanism of software development or IT operations process is made explicit it is often hard or impossible to hold a discussion about improving it. Without an explicit understanding of how things work and how work is actually done, any discussion of problems tends to be emotional, anecdotal and subjective. With an explicit understanding it is possible to move to a more rational, empirical, objective discussion of issues. This is more likely to facilitate [[consensus]] around improvement suggestions.
