This kind of environment will help students construct knowledge by doing, in line with the constructivism philosophy of education.\n\n"

That we find our way outside the latter with the same self-evidence as within it: we succeed better and better by letting others perform our own orientation services. \"Where am I?\" - We let others tell us and show us. \"How do I get to my destination?\" - We let others find the way and lead us there. We delegate self-localization and destination finding, not to other people, although of course there is that too, but to technical devices: to the *Global Positioning System* and to individual navigation systems that record its performance and convert it into leadership knowledge.\n\nThrough the navigation devices in the various vehicles with which we move, we tie this knowledge back to our familiar living environment. Because of its individuality, the car plays a prominent role in this process: it is itself part of my living environment, a mobile piece of it; in this, it is quite similar to myself. Automobile navigation thus means: Connection of a system that guides us, as if everywhere were our lifeworld, to this lifeworld itself. - This is the theme that I will unfold in the following five chapters."
