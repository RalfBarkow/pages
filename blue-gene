The project will focus on modeling the folding process of a protein of average size: about 300 amino acids. The number of possible three-dimensional shapes for a protein is greater than the number of atoms in the universe, and the folding model will encompass more than a billion forces acting over a trillion different time steps. Blue Gene will be 500 times faster than the fastest supercomputer today, but it is still expected to take around one year of continuous, around-the-clock processing to solve the folding problem. ",
