[[Counting]] does involve a starting number and if Philoponus is right about the nature of time, it is hard to see how we can avoid the conclusion that time must have had a starting unit. In that case, the units would be countable from the first unit onwards, as Philoponus says. Sorabji’s conceptual claim about traversal misses the fact that Philoponus relies on a theory about the nature of time. It is thus irrelevant to Philoponus’ argument."
