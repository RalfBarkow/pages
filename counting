      "text": "Kronecker made his famous quote “God made the integers, all else is the work of man.” at a meeting in 1886 (from his obituary, 1823-1891, in Mathematische Annalen 43:1-25). It was recently publicized as the title of a book by Stephen Hawking, God Created the Integers: The mathematical breakthroughs that changed history (2007). The quote is associated with Kronecker’s belief that mathematics should address finite numbers and should avoid the irrational numbers, a position similar to that taken here with regard to real numbers. But there is no need to interject metaphysics, man created the rationals as well as the irrationals. Brian Smith (On the Origin of Objects, 1996, p.355) comments that Kronecker got it backwards. Metaphysics arises out of indefiniteness, the absence of boundaries, from which we then carve out the discrete numbers. Irving Stein (The Concept of Object as the Foundation of Physics, 1996, abstract) points to the first distinction: “Objects arise from restrictions on nonspace.”"

We look at a forest and see individual trees, unable to comprehend that 2/3 of each tree is below ground. It is the dense interweaving of roots that is the forest’s cognitive network. In essence, counting destroys the richness of reality."

The uncountable constructions of our minds illustrate clearly the limitations of arithmetic. We cannot count thoughts, feelings, beliefs, the wind, a river, sunshine, frost, the internet, a conversation or the web of life. We can count peaks but not mountains, snowflakes but not snow, branches but not roots, heartbeats but not metabolism, airplanes but not clouds, notes but not music, words but not ideas. We cannot count things that change faster than our ability to assign numbers to them. We cannot count the discrete packets of data distributed over the internet because there are too many and they change too quickly. If we were to freeze the internet, or any physiological process, or any natural process, we might be able to count the static pieces that break off but we would be counting only the fragments of a dead thing, the living thing would have moved on to be something different. We cannot accurately say out loud the national debt (even if we could count the dollars) because by the time it was out of our mouths, the debt would have changed by a personal fortune."

Facets of that replica fit categories we have established from prior experience. We have in mind one replica of our personal category rabbit. Now we might look closer and see three rabbits. The cardinality of that ensemble can be assigned a number, the number of rabbits. However, if we introduce a different (imposed) perceptual category, say age, we cease to have three rabbits and may have instead one parent and two children. Cardinality depends upon not only a cognitive category but also the ability to hold that category consistent in a dynamically changing perceptual environment."

This viewpoint is virtually opposite to the idea that mathematical operations are independent of application. The sum of the concept 2 and the concept 3 is a symbolic definition, not an operation in the sense of put together. Technically, the set of two {o1,o2} put together with the set of three {o3,o4,o5} is a new set with two members, {{o1,o2},{o3,o4,o5}}. In order to get to five, the two sets need to be joined by Union; addition over sets, not addition over elements. To apply the Union operation, members need to be indexed so that they can be uniquely identified, since Union does not support duplicates. Addition as fusion avoids these issues."

We do not add 1 to the object itself, we add it to the running tally. Any difference will do for indexing, numbers are only a convenience. The running sequence too has nothing to do with a tally, it is yet another cognitive scheme to keep track of thoughts. We do not assign n + 1 to a particular object, any one that remains unindexed will do."

It was recently publicized as the title of a book by Stephen Hawking, God Created the Integers: The mathematical breakthroughs that changed history (2007). The quote is associated with Kronecker’s belief that mathematics should address finite numbers and should avoid the irrational numbers, a position similar to that taken here with regard to real numbers. But there is no need to interject metaphysics, man created the rationals as well as the irrationals. Brian Smith (On the Origin of Objects, 1996, p.355) comments that Kronecker got it backwards. Metaphysics arises out of indefiniteness, the absence of boundaries, from which we then carve out the discrete numbers. Irving Stein (The Concept of Object as the Foundation of Physics, 1996, abstract) points to the first distinction: “Objects arise from restrictions on nonspace.”"

Uniqueness is a consequence of participation in a contextual web of interrelations. Counting then is a process of successively making and dissolving distinctions, with the goal of removing all uniqueness and discernibility from an interaction with physical reality."

This viewpoint is virtually opposite to the idea that mathematical operations are independent of application. The sum of the concept 2 and the concept 3 is a symbolic definition, not an operation in the sense of put together. Technically, the set of two {o1,o2} put together with the set of three {o3,o4,o5} is a new set with two members, {{o1,o2},{o3,o4,o5}}. In order to get to five, the two sets need to be joined by Union; addition over sets, not addition over elements. To apply the Union operation, members need to be indexed so that they can be uniquely identified, since Union does not support duplicates. Addition as fusion avoids these issues."

While being constructed, tally marks are indices. A sign is arbitrary, with no connection to what it represents other than convention. Words are signs."
