Doing this involves more than persua­sion; it requires the ability to inspire. Unlike persuasion, inspiration evokes a willingness to make sacrifices in the pursuit of long-run objectives or ideals.

Leadership requires the ability to implement pursuit of the vision. Inspiration without implementation is provoca­tion, not leadership. Implementation without inspiration is management or administration, not leadership. Therefore, leaders must be both creative—in order to inspire—and courageous—in order to induce implementation.

Positive images incorporate something that we do not have but want, for example, law and order, a clean, healthy envi­ronment, and peace. Negative images incorporate some­ thing that we have but do not want, for example, crime, poverty, and disease. Negative images are much easier to formulate and to mobilize people around. However, action against negative images often results in outcomes that are less desirable than the original problem. For example, when the United States tried to get rid of alcoholism by prohibition, it got rid of neither alcoholism nor alcohol, and got organized crime. We try to get rid of crime by incarcerating criminals, despite the fact that those who have been released from prison have a higher probability of committing another, more serious crime than the one that put them in prison."
