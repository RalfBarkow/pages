      "text": "⇒ [[Bamboo Bay]]: There is a small, almost hidden beach in Macau called Cheoc Wan or “Bamboo Bay.” Despite its immediate proximity to one of the most densely populated and heavily touristed areas in the world—the casinos drawing tens of millions of visitors each year merely five miles away—Bamboo Bay is a quiet place. Some older locals come daily to swim in the muddy, trash-filled ocean water. On weekends a few families, mostly PortugueseMacanese, spend some time here, children playing in the sand as their parents may have done in their own youth, in the old country. The few tourists who do make their way to Bamboo Bay tend to be mainland Chinese or other East Asians. But they do not come to swim or sunbathe. They come to take picturespictures of themselves posing in front of the shallow waves coming in, sitting on a rock, or walking along the beach with long hair photogenically blowing in the breeze. These beachgoers do not stay long. They might stop to have a snack at the little café, but then they quickly move on to other attractions."
