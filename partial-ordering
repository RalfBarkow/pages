Consider contains to be parent-of. You cannot be your own parent (irreflexive), and you can’t be your parent’s parent (antisymmetric). As well, your parents are not the parent-of your children (intransitive). Technically then containment is not a partial ordering because it is not transitive. There is a transitive concept that we might call contained-at-any-depth. In our example it would be the ancestor relation. But the deeper point is that using conventional abstractions based on sets does not particularly help us to think differently about the formal structure of distinction."
