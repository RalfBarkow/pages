Increased accuracy in withheld taxes would probably be judged as lower quality if it lead to wider variation in the amounts on pay checks.

Variation, however, is usually not accepted. Depending upon the system, one usually expects a consistent total amount from period to period or expects a consistent pay rate from period to period. Increased accuracy in withheld taxes would probably be judged as lower quality if it lead to wider variation in the amounts on pay checks.

Yes, it is easy to see in hindsight what might have been a better way, but that does not mean it would have been obvious at the time. At the time of installation, it appears no-one considered access to either the garbage disposal or the water purifier system mounting bolts. The problem is not the definition of \"the simplest thing\" but rather \"could possibly work\". The definition of \"could possibly work\" has changed since the installation. For a mechanical change like this, it might have been cost-effective to plan for more eventualities; however, for software systems, there are really no analogies to \"blocked access\" or \"odd angles\". The cost and effort to change things in software is very low and (arguably) it is lower than the cost of planning, and the changes rarely lead to scraped knuckles.</i>",
