The war is perceived by the Western public as an epochal change, as the beginning of a new era of renewed bloc confrontation between bourgeois democracies and authoritarian regimes.

The war thus represents the transformation of quantity into quality: Contradictions that previously manifested themselves in developments that were steadily growing in intensity are now escalating."

The current conflict can possibly be summed up in the concept of crisis imperialism: While imperialism had entered a phase of global expansion of capital valorization in the second half of the 20th century, the current confrontation between rotten state apparatuses is taking place in a phase of contraction of the valorization process, which lacks the perspective of a new accumulation regime (as was last the case under Fordism) because of the global level of productivity. It is like a battle on the \"Titanic\" in which the economically inferior state monsters permanently descend socio-economically or even threaten to turn into failed states in the long run. The notion of a new Cold War with its clear bloc confrontation is deceptive, since crisis-induced competition continues to operate within the West as well: between the U.S. and Germany, for example, or within the EU between France and Germany, whose arms program the government in Paris could perceive as a threat to its military superiority within the framework of the European Union. France had already turned its back on NATO once - in the middle of the Cold War."

Russia, which is falling further and further behind the West in economic terms, is endeavoring to maintain its status as a great power through the sheer use of military force after Russia was unable to reverse the 2014 Western-backed overthrow in Ukraine through similar methods of indirect intervention. Russia, with its economy built primarily on [[commodity]] exports, is steadily losing influence in the post-Soviet space, while Putin's imperial conception of building a fossil commodity empire threatens to become obsolete as the West seeks to transform its energy system. The Hydrogen Office, opened by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock (Greens) during a visit to Kiev in January to help Ukraine become a supplier of \"green\" hydrogen to the EU, virtually symbolized Russian fears of crisis-induced decline. The Russian leadership apparently considered the costs of further erosion of its own sphere of influence in the post-Soviet space to be higher than the costs (which it seems to have criminally underestimated) of the war now being waged."
