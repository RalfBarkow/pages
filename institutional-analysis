      "text": "The purpose of this paper is to clarify what it means to \"do\" institutional analysis. Institutional analysis can be broadly defined as the examination of how rules, goods and production technologies, and communities of understanding jointly affect the structure of situations in which individuals face incentives, adopt strategies of actions, and produce outcomes for themselves and others. The first section of the paper is devoted to an examination of the need for a conceptual framework for doing institutional analysis. Then, I turn to an explication of the elements of analysis used at both the focal and the contextural levels of analysis. The last section addresses the application of institutional analysis to problems of development."

      "text": "The parable of the blind men trying to identify an elephant can be applied to describe the current state of the social sciences. Each discipline focuses on a particular part of a large, complex whole and defines the whole largely with the characteristics found in \"its\" relevant neighborhood. Economists tend to focus exclusively on behavior in market structures and to dismiss the essential role of political structure in establishing and maintaining these same market structures. Political scientists frequently presume that \"the policy process\" is contained almost exclusively inside the voting booth and the halls of legislative bodies. Rarely do political scientists examine the effects of laws on individual decision making within firms and across markets."

      "text": "Specialization is useful when analysts address questions about well-specified and isolable settings. Micro-economists are able to answer many important questions about the effects of various changes in exogenous factors -- such as major upward or downward shifts in factor availability --on outcomes such as the price and quantity of goods exchanged in highly developed competitive markets. Political scientists are able to answer many questions about how changes in committee structure in a legislative body may affect the type of legislation passed. Economists, political scientists, and other social scientists do not, however, have a general method for addressing such questions as how to help underdeveloped countries, lacking either well-developed markets or political structures, enhance general productivity and democratic institutions. Aspects of a general method are contained in all of the social sciences."

At the focal level of analysis, one addresses how the [[Structure]] of a situation and the assumptions made about individual actors, affect the incentives facing individuals, the types of strategies individuals adopt, and the consequences produced. At the contextural level of analysis, one addresses how rules, goods and technology, and the attributes of community understanding produce particular action arenas (and, thus, the resulting patterns of outcomes generated at the focal level of analysis). Recent developments in the social sciences have concentrated primarily on the focal level of analysis. The addition of a systematic, self-conscious method to conduct analysis of the contextural level, building on work already conducted at the focal level, is an important addition in our approach."

(This is the rule that the military uses to assign uniforms to recruits!) Changes in boundary and position rules affect the number of participants who enter and exit. This, in-turn, affects whether the resulting market is competitive, oligopolistic, or monopolistic. Market performance is dramatically affected by these structural attributes."

Each discipline focuses on a particular part of a large, complex whole and defines the whole largely with the characteristics found in \"its\" relevant neighborhood. Economists tend to focus exclusively on behavior in market structures and to dismiss the essential role of political structure in establishing and maintaining these same market structures. Political scientists frequently presume that \"the policy process\" is contained almost exclusively inside the voting booth and the halls of legislative bodies. Rarely do political scientists examine the effects of laws on individual decision making within firms and across markets."

Micro-economists are able to answer many important questions about the effects of various changes in exogenous factors -- such as major upward or downward shifts in factor availability --on outcomes such as the price and quantity of goods exchanged in highly developed competitive markets. Political scientists are able to answer many questions about how changes in committee structure in a legislative body may affect the type of legislation passed. Economists, political scientists, and other social scientists do not, however, have a general method for addressing such questions as how to help underdeveloped countries, lacking either well-developed markets or political structures, enhance general productivity and democratic institutions. Aspects of a general method are contained in all of the social sciences."

A \"model of the individual\" includes assumptions about four clusters of variables: the way that individuals acquire, process, retain, and use information, the way individuals assign values to actions and outcomes, the way individuals select particular courses of action, and the resources that individuals bring to a situation. Using the set of assumptions made about the situation and about individuals, the institutional analyst derives inferences about the types of actions that will be selected by participants and how these are likely to cumulate into results."
