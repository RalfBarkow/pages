In our shipping scenario, for example, Cyc does not know about the concept of “latest pick up time to be considered for next day delivery” and its ramifications. Therefore, we defined a new binary relation latestTimeTypeForPickUp to express this characteristic of a shipping company and wrote deductive rules to express its consequences. The key thing to note, however, is that we build on an already existing vast common sense [[knowledge base]], and basic things need not be explained. Let us expand on this a bit."
