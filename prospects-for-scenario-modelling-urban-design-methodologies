Whether these variables of urban morphology can be managed to reduce GHGs with significant efficacy will clearly depend upon whether new strategies can identify the role of such factors and guide effective morphological changes. We present an assessment of the opportunities for such reductions using a new generation of scenario-modelling urban design tools.\n"
