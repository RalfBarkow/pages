It is shown that the second law of thermodynamics, when generalized to include information, sets absolute limits to the minimum amount of dissipation required by open-loop control. In addition, an information-theoretic analysis of closed-loop control shows feedback control to be essentially a zero sum game: each bit of information gathered directly from a dynamical systems by a control device can serve to decrease the entropy of that system by at most one bit additional to the reduction of entropy attainable without such information (open-loop control). Consequences for the control of discrete binary systems and chaotic systems are discussed."

      "text": "Information and uncertainty represent complementary aspects of control. Open-loop control methods attempt to reduce our uncertainty about system variables such as position or velocity, thereby increasing our information about the actual values of those variables. Closed-loop methods obtain information about system variables, and use that information to decrease our uncertainty about the values of those variables. Although the literature in control theory implicitly recognizes the importance of information in the control process, information is rarely regarded as the central quantity of interest [1]. In this Letter we address explicitely the role of information and uncertainty in control processes by presenting a novel formalism for analyzing these quantities using techniques of statistical mechanics and information theory. Specifically, based on a recent proposal by Lloyd and Slotine [2], we formulate a general model of control and investigate it using entropy-like quantities. This allows us to make mathematically precise each part of the intuitive statement that in a control process, information must constantly be acquired, processed and used to constrain or maintain the trajectory of a system. Along this line, we prove several limiting results relating the ability of a control device to reduce the entropy of an arbitrary system in the cases where (i) such a controller acts independently of the state of the system (open-loop control), and (ii) the control action is influenced by some information gathered from the system (closed-loop control). The results are applied both to the stochastic example of coupled Markovian processes and to the deterministic example of chaotic maps. These results not only combine concepts of dynamical entropy and information in a unified picture, but also prove to be fundamental in that they represent the ultimate physical limitations faced by any control systems."
