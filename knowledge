This way of looking at knowledge breaks with a long-standing tradition that sees it as a mainly anthropomorphic, subjective concept. According to this tradition, knowledge presupposes that there is a sentient being, such as a human being. Knowledge, in other words, would only exist in minds. According to this idea, knowledge seems to be subjective. \n"
