[https://homepages.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/Peirce.pdf pdf]\n> This essay explores the Mathematics of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. We concentrate on his notational approaches to basic logic and his general ideas about Sign, Symbol and diagrammatic thought. In the course of this paper we discuss two notations of Peirce, one of Nicod and one of Spencer-Brown. Needless to say, a notation connotes an entire language and these contexts are elaborated herein. The first Peirce notation is the portmanteau (see below) Sign of illation. The second Peirce notation is the form of implication in the existential graphs (see below). The Nicod notation is a portmanteau of the Sheffer stroke and an (overbar) negation sign. The Spencer-Brown notation is in line with the Peirce Sign of illation. It remained for Spencer-Brown (some fifty years after Peirce and Nicod) to see the relevance of an arithmetic of forms underlying his notation and thus putting the final touch on a development that, from a broad perspective, looks like the world mind doing its best to remember the significant patterns that join logic, speech and mathematics. The movement downward to the Form ('we take the form of distinction for the form.’[9, Chapter 1, page 1]) through the joining together of words into archetypal portmanteau Signs can be no accident in this process of return to the beginning.\n\n\n"

He discovered a\nhost of iconic notations for the connectives and a way to map them and their\nsymmetries to the vertices of a four dimensional cube and to a three dimensional\nprojection of that cube in the form of a rhombic dodecahedron. Symmetries of the\nconnectives become, for Zellweger, mirror symmetries in planes perpendicular to\nthe axes of the rhombic dodecahedron. See Figure 2. Zellweger uses his own\niconic notations for the connectives to label the rhombic dodecahedron, which he\ncalls the “Logical Garnet”."

It is a\nsignificant linkage of domains. On the one hand, we have logic embedded in\neveryday speech. One does not expect to find direct connections of the structure of\nlogical speech with the symmetries of Euclidean Geometry. It is the surprise of\nthis connection that appeals to the intuition. Logic and reasoning are properties of\nlanguage/mind in action. Geometry and symmetry are part of the mindset that\nwould discover eternal forms and grasp the world as a whole. To find, by going to\nthe source of logic, that we build simultaneously a world of reason and a world of\ngeometry incites a vision of the full combination of the temporal and the eternal, a\nunification of action and contemplation. The relationship of logic and geometry\ndemands a deep investigation. This investigation is in its infancy."

Note the big dichotomies\nacross the opposite vertices. These are the oppositions between Marked and\nUnmarked states, the opposition between A and not A, and the opposition between\nB and not B. If you draw a straight line through any pair of these oppositions and\nconsider the reflection in the plane perpendicular to this straight line, you will see\none of the three basic symmetries of the connectives. Along the A/not A axis the\nlabels and their reflections change by a cross around the letter A. Along the B/not\nB axis, the labels change by a cross around the letter B. These reflections\ncorrespond to negating A or B respectively. Along the Marked/Unmarked axis, the\nsymmetry is a bit more subtle. You will note the corresponding formulas differ by\na cross around the whole formula and that both variables have been negated\n(crossed). Each mirror plane performs the corresponding symmetry through\nreflection. In the very center of the Garnet is a double labeled cube, labeled with\nthe symbols “A S B” and “A Z B”. These stand for “Exclusive Or” and its\nnegation. We shall see why S and Z have a special combined symmetry under these operations. The rest of this section provides the extra details of the\ndiscussion."

Reflection in a horizontal plane has the effect of changing B to its crossed form in all expressions. Reflection in a vertical plane that is transverse to projection plane of the drawing, interchanges A and its crossed form. Finally, reflection in a plane parallel to the projection plane of the drawing interchanges marks with unmarks. We call this the Marked/Unmarked symmetry. (p. 95)"

        "text": "In a previous post I’ve been discussing the beautiful materializations of the logical notation by Shea Zellweger. I was very much surprised to see him discussed by Louis Kauffman at the end of his book [http://www.math.uic.edu/~kauffman/Laws.pdf pdf] about ‘Laws of Form’ which I mentioned in the previous post. Kauffman even made a version of Zellweger’s ‘logical garnet’ based on Spencer-Brown’s symbols !"

He discovered a\nhost of iconic notations for the connectives and a way to map them and their\nsymmetries to the vertices of a four dimensional cube and to a three dimensional\nprojection of that cube in the form of a rhombic dodecahedron. Symmetries of the\nconnectives become, for Zellweger, mirror symmetries in planes perpendicular to\nthe axes of the rhombic dodecahedron. See Figure 2. Zellweger uses his own\niconic notations for the connectives to label the rhombic dodecahedron, which he\ncalls the “Logical Garnet”."

        "text": "This is a remarkable connection of polyhedral geometry with basic logic. The\nmeaning and application of this connection is yet to be fully appreciated. It is a\nsignificant linkage of domains. On the one hand, we have logic embedded in\neveryday speech. One does not expect to find direct connections of the structure of\nlogical speech with the symmetries of Euclidean Geometry. It is the surprise of\nthis connection that appeals to the intuition. Logic and reasoning are properties of\nlanguage/mind in action. Geometry and symmetry are part of the mindset that\nwould discover eternal forms and grasp the world as a whole. To find, by going to\nthe source of logic, that we build simultaneously a world of reason and a world of\ngeometry incites a vision of the full combination of the temporal and the eternal, a\nunification of action and contemplation. The relationship of logic and geometry\ndemands a deep investigation. This investigation is in its infancy."
