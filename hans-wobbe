I suspect that this is hard to understand without an illustration so I will try to cobble something together, but unfortunately won't be able to do so much before the weekend of the 20th. So far, in designing a mock up of a PIM for an associate, the design limitation of the logical table structures, the screen space, and the way Eddies' tables are implemented has kept me from getting into trouble with this relatively unorthodox, but really beneficial (if you hate typing) approach. -- hwo",

I suspect that this is hard to understand without an illustration so I will try to cobble something together, but unfortunately won't be able to do so much before the weekend of the 20th. So far, in designing a mock up of a PIM for an associate, the design limitation of the logical table structures, the screen space, and the way Eddies' tables are implemented has kept me from getting into trouble with this relatively unorthodox, but really beneficial (if you hate typing) approach. -- hwo",
