A bunch of wikis do that, [[Wiki Story]] ([http://www.wikistory.com/wiki/WikiStory_Home www.wikistory.com]) is the first that comes to mind.  People can still be annonymous, since choosing a username does not reduce anonymity.  There would be less editing with this solution, because people might not want to register, for whatever reason, and I haven't visited C2.com before but the wiki appears to not incorporate a user system.  So there are downsides to this approach and instances where it may not be applicable.",
