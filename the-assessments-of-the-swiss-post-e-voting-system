Not only did they whitewash findings by outside experts that the system was insecure, but on election day the system simply didn't work: the Electoral Commission estimated that 20,000 people registered to use iVote but did not receive a voting credential in time to vote; as a consequence, the Supreme Court of NSW voided the results in three local elections. The NSW government has been careless about driver's license security, health data privacy, and covid-tracing records, too: there's a pattern."
