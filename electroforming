Technically, it is a process of synthesizing a metal object by controlling the electrodeposition of metal passing through an electrolytic solution onto a metal or metallized form. More simply, a metal skin is built up on a metal surface, or any surface that has been rendered electro conductive through the application of a paint that contains metal particles. Essentially, a metal part is fabricated from the plating itself. [https://rotoplas.net/electroforming/ page], [https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA018874.pdf pdf]\n\n "
