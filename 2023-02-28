One can only bring oneself into a form which meets certain requirements in social intercourse, fulfills certain preconditions or can also trigger certain reaction modes, for example of a negative kind. I believe that only in this way - and not via the transmission thesis - one can explain the enormous diversity of individuals. If one assumes that consciousness is a kind of blank slate, and disregards the fact that it has at most certain minimal biological pre-programming, be it Chomsky's innate language skills, be it biologically based instincts, consciousness is enormously capable of being shaped. If, in contrast, culture and its offerings are seen as relatively uniform, one must explain how the high degree of individuality we observe comes about."

We all know about it, but the intention of cybernetics is to try to make such vaguely understood tricks perfectly explicit and clear, so that we really know how to use them. In Chapter Five the simple algedonode is used as a building block to construct a larger system. And the object of understanding that systemn is to discover the meaning of hierarchy in organizations. Hierarchies are needed for fundamental reasons given in logic when big systems are becoming organized. When they are translated into human terms, they seem to be all about power and prestige — with the result that people lose sight of their real nature and meaning in the system.

        "text": "Wir müssen an diesem Begriff der strukturellen Kopplung noch etwas arbeiten, und zwar vor allem in der Hinsicht, dass eine Kopplung, wie es uns der Formbegriff nahe legt, eine Zweiseitenform ist. Sie bezieht sich nicht auf die gesamte Umwelt, denn nicht alles, was es überhaupt gibt, ist mit dem System strukturell gekoppelt. Vielmehr sind die Kopplungen hochselektiv. Etwas ist eingeschlossen, und etwas anderes ist ausgeschlossen. Das Ausgeschlossene kann durchaus das System kausal betreffen, aber dann nur destruktiv. Im Bereich der strukturellen Kopplung hingegen sind Möglichkeiten gespeichert, die das System verwenden kann, die es in Informationen transformieren kann. Unter diesem Gesichtspunkt könnte man sagen, dass strukturelle Kopplung einerseits einen Ausschließungseffekt hat - in diesem Bereich ist das System indifferent - und andererseits eine Kanalisierung von Kausalitäten bewirkt, die das System verwenden kann. Dabei bleibt das Merkmal des Begriffs erhalten, dass die strukturelle Kopplung immer mit der Autopoiesis kompatibel ist; ebendeshalb gibt es Möglichkeiten, das System zu beeinflussen, soweit die Autopoiesis nicht zerstört wird. Man kann dieses vielleicht reformulieren, indem man sagt, dass die Spaltung der Umwelt durch die strukturelle Kopplung in Ausgeschlossenes und Eingeschlossenes dazu tendiert, die relevanten Beziehungen zwischen Umwelt und System zu reduzieren und auf einen schmalen Bereich von Einfluss zuzuschneiden, und dass nur dann ein System etwas mit Irritationen und Kausalitäten anfangen kann. Nur wenn nicht alles gleichzeitig auf das System einwirkt, sondern hochselektive patterns bereitliegen, kann das System auf Irritationen und „Perturbationen\" (Maturana) reagieren, das heißt sie als Information verstehen und die Strukturen entsprechend anpassen oder Operationen entsprechend einsetzen, um die Strukturen zu transformieren."

One can only bring oneself into a form which meets certain requirements in social intercourse, fulfills certain preconditions or can also trigger certain reaction modes, for example of a negative kind. I believe that only in this way - and not via the transmission thesis - one can explain the enormous diversity of individuals. If one assumes that consciousness is a kind of blank slate, and disregards the fact that it has at most certain minimal biological pre-programming, be it Chomsky's innate language skills, be it biologically based instincts, consciousness is enormously capable of being shaped. If, in contrast, culture and its offerings are seen as relatively uniform, one must explain how the high degree of individuality we observe comes about."
