Perhaps in a wiki :) Usenet would probably be a better medium in the sense that anything there is wide open to all kinds of critique and peer review from knowledgeable people and the threshold to sending a reply is very small. Most groups get more or less permanently archived. I haven't gathered the momentum or nerve to start posting random ideas, though. Writing with a pseudonym should not be too scary after all.",

This made providing inputs on his accomplishments for annual performance reports a snap, as he could provide both what he did as well as it's impact on the operational mission (we are military folks). I started doing the same thing, just a tiny notebook I could cram into a corner, and it worked pretty well. In my new job though, I turned this into an Access database, just to have something on my computer to track my accomplishments throughout the day. As I work trouble tickets, create new system functionality, attend meetings and come up with ideas to solve pressing problems, etc. I log it in under whichever category it applies (maintenance, project management, development, etc) and include the impact as a separate field to show the immediate and projected impact on the system or unit. Now I can spit out one or more reports on-demand to see my accomplishments to-date. Helps me see what I've done so far this year, areas I need to spend more time on (community service always comes up short for me), etc. I know this isn't a paper notebook, but so far it works for me. I just hope the hard drive doesn't fail... :) -- [[Dave Cantrell]]",
