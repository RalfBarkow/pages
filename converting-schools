The new genre of software we have in mind is a set of open, reconfigurable, repurposeable tools for student tasks, tasks that are more like design and student research than conventional activities such as exercises and short problem solving. Such a shift in student activity is consistent with much that is recommended in many current educational reform documents. Nevertheless, we believe those reform efforts could be immensely aided with suitable material support, a point that is almost never taken to heart. Reform needs implements, not just implementation plans."
