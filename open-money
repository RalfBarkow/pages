Whereas technological constraints tended to lead to the implementation of unmanageably large pools of users sharing little in terms of need or purpose, and offered no choice of the <em>currency</em> to use, these days higher-[[variety]] solutions are practicable. For example, a user might choose to make use of several such <em>open money</em> pools. Some might use human time (hours) as a unit of account. Others might use kWh - perhaps to record production, consumption and storage in a neighbourhood microgrid, and yet others might record something more abstract such as reputation or confidence. However, the most typical usage might be to record commitments made which could otherwise be settled using [[legal tender]]. Any number of such <em>open money</em> instances might be set up within any community, and at any scale. The point of intersection is overlap in the communities using each of these, and the total <em>[[commitment]]</em> recorded for any individual (or business, or other organization) will be the sum of the <em>commitment</em>s made by that <em>user</em> across all of the <em>open money</em> pools of which he, she or it is a member.</p>"

Larger sized pools would almost certainly require the assistance of more sophisticated technology, but in general the smaller the size the more manageable the set. Size is not the only factor, or even the most important. Some commonality of purpose, geographical proximity or other <em>common bond</em> helps to constrain the complexity. For that reason any approach supporting the management of multiple <em>open money</em> pools needs to minimize the risk of [[name collisions]] and other [[variety]] challenges generally. Therefore (most particularly within software implementations) the names of <em>entities</em> (such as <em>users</em>, <em>currencies</em> and <em>accounts</em>) are contained within <em>namespaces</em> although that is not essential in isolated instances.</p>"
