Example: ADD\n\n- [[CATALYZING]]: FOR DAVID - PLS EDIT THIS SHORT DESCRIPTION AND LET ME KNOW IF YOU AGREE WITH ADDING THIS FUNCTION: one thing is to protect, ensure and nourish, but yet a different one is functioning as 2Catalysator\" - kind of adding a substance/ an ingredient/ a logic that unleashes the expansion; self-replication of the commons and commoning, example [[Local Provisioning]]\n\nDB:  I think we either disaggregate the ENSURING category above into many narrower categories, or leave ENSURING as the general, catch-all category.  CATALYZING is one aspect of ENSURING.\n\n- [[STEWARDING]]: intersectoral & intergenerational stewardship to deal with the limits of commoning.  State action may be required to manage large-scale CPRs, assure basic standards such human rights and due process, or intervene to prevent collective action from degenerating in mafias or maras. Examples:  large tracts of public lands with minerals or forests; the Italian mafia or organized crime exploiting public-trust access to wild berries in Sweden. (A problem: how to reconcile indigenous or commons notions of justice and due process with those of the state.) \n\n- [[PROPAGATING]]: supporting the propagation of ecosystems of commoning. Example: ADD\n(This category seems very similar to NOURISHING and CATALYZING.  Delete?)\n\n- [[PROTECTING]]: providing legal recognition & protection for commoning, especially against enclosure.  Decentralize authority (subsidiarity) & transcend the limits of representative democracy and bureaucracy. Example: coastal fisheries as commons; local, small-scale harvest of farm animals; neighborhood commoning.  (BUT: How to draw lines between representative democracy and bureaucracy on the one hand, and the appropriate scope of commons authority?) \n\n- [[GUARANTEEING]]: state powers have a role to play for assuring commons and commoning principles are performed and respect standards as Human Rights, accountability and transparency. \n(Already mentioned in PROTECTING above.) \nExample: ADD\n\n"

Just as the state typically has agencies with the official mission of promoting markets, so the state can be vehicles or clearinghouses through which commoners can share technical, legal and financial assistance and guidance on the social practices and cultural aspects of commoning.\n\nb) Build infrastructures, design protocols and open spaces that make it easier and cheaper for commoners to instigate self-organized commoning.  Smart energy grids, TCP/IP technical protocols for the Internet, Wi-Fi protocols, public squares and meeting spaces, and free server space for websites, email and data (e.g., Open Commons Linz) are prime examples.\n\nc) Create new types of finance for the commons.  The state could provide essential support for commons to start up and expand by establishing finance systems and currencies that go beyond private banking and finance markets.  Examples include cooperative finance, social and ethical banking, alternative currencies, a Commons Development Fund, and securities laws to allow crowdfunding of commons projects.  \n\nd) Social support for commoning, especially UBI.  By reducing people’s dependency on the market sector, the state can open up time and social space for people to participate in commoning.  (BUT:  Given the hostility of capital-driven markets towards commons and their influence over the state, how would it be politically possible for the state to provide this social support?

The seventh principle is key in understanding the relationship between commoners and state powers. It claims the need for minimal state recognition of commoners' rights to self-organize and govern themselves. The right of the users (or \"appropriators,\" in Ostrom's language) of common resources to devise and control their own institutions must not be challenged by external governmental authorities. This is our starting point. We could call it the \"Do not harm the commons\" principle. \nBut this is not enough. The state must also ensure basic conditions for creating and maintaining commons.  This has four primary dimensions: authorizing commons under law; nourishing their development in non-intrusive ways; catalyzing and propagating commons; and overseeing macro-concerns beyond the capacities of individual commons, such as mediating and resolving conflict within and among commons.  \n\nIt is evident that these kinds of support for commons governance transcend representative democracy and bureaucracy because they entail distributed, [[polycentric governance]] based on the principle of [[subsidiarity]].\n"

Yes, it would be great for states to encourage basic standards of human rights, transparency, etc., but in practice I worry that this role could become very legalistic, bureaucratic and political -- i.e., an opening for state power to intrude upon commons and dictate what is acceptable. A difficult issue. Should a new or  ancient commons have to meet the legal metrics that a (perhaps hostile) state demands?"

        "text": "- a) I would like to leave it with verbs, i.e. active formulation; therefor I was trying to look for \"couples of verbs\" based on what we've discussed so far: See result above. \nDB: Okay to verbs, but I find that a mechanical use of \"paired verbs\" a bit distracting and artificial. The point is not always so clear and easily grasped.\n- b) \"Protect and guarantee\" is official wording for  state functions in the context of human rights  and is less \"authoritative\" than \"authorizing\"; so, I would suggest do use this wording\nDB:  But \"protect & guarantee\" is a phrasing intended to validate the state's supreme role in recognizing & enforcing rights -- which I'm not sure we wish to reinforce.  My work with Burns sensitized me to the distinct limits of the market/state in respecting human rights.  \"Legally authorize\" would be the better term, I think. \n- c). loved the \"overseeing macro-concerns, and this means concretely f.il \"mediating and conflict resolving, right?   DB: Yes.  But \"conciliating\" is not a word, or at least not the right word.  \"Overseeing macro-concerns....\" may be a more useful term because it is more comprehensive than conflict-resolution.\n\n- d) I added a fourth one - because I still think that we might need the \"Nourish & Steward)  DB: I agree with the idea, but I think \"Steward\" is not a proper state function; it is a commoner function.  (States think about power logics and control, but not in the manner of stewards, who care about intrinsic value and relationships.)\n\n- e) might state powers also be responsible for setting some standards for principled action like accountability (Rechenschaftspflicht) openness and transparency of structures and processes\n\nDB: Yes, I think this would be appropriate.  However, there are so few working examples to build upon.\nSH: but we can claim for it - using one or two examples would be enough; my point is: The state sets the norm of say \"most-favorite-nation-principle\" in the WTO context, and this rules it all; everything else derives from this kind of ideas. So, even if there are no examples - we can claim, that this must be done. \nDB:  Hmm.  I am now ambivalent on this question.  Yes, it would be great for states to encourage basic standards of human rights, transparency, etc., but in practice I worry that this role could become very legalistic, bureaucratic and political -- i.e., an opening for state power to intrude upon commons and dictate what is acceptable. A difficult issue. Should a new or  ancient commons have to meet the legal metrics that a (perhaps hostile) state demands?"
