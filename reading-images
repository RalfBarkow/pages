Visualization helps us make sense of the processes of computers and use them to get new information—even and especially when the materials they deal with are not images. This is shown by the field explicitly dedicated to the study of texts: literary analysis. The most recent and innovative research does not use “literary” tools. Instead of reading texts, literary scholars visualize them, utilizing images rather than language."
