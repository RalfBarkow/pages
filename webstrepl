We have a working solution that involves a [[PharoJS]]-based client talking to a Pharo server. The code is available at https://github.com/PharoJS/WebStREPL. We hope this might help people exploring client-server apps with PharoJS. Your comments are welcome.\n@NorbertHartl Tell us if this helps you with your investigations"
