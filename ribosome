        "text": "The mechanical computer is similar to the [[ribosome]] in several other respects. Both operate on two polymers simultaneously, and their basic cycle consists of processing an incoming molecule that matches the currently held molecules on the first polymer, elongating the second polymer and moving sideways. Like the ribosome in the living cell, the computer requires supporting devices similar in function to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to load bare transition molecules with correct alphabet monomers, and a device similar in function to proteases to decompose the trace polymer and make its components available for reuse. However, unlike the ribosome, which only ‘reads’ the messenger RNA in one direction, the computer edits the tape polymer and may move in either direction. (p. 500)"
