The burden of justification is considerable, especially since only recently a status nascendi at best has been diagnosed for this field.

The underlying assumption is that the system of society, by switching from a stratified order to functional differentiation, has to reorganize the problem of inclusion/exclusion of persons (Fuchs 1997a). If all social functions, which have been served in the strata so far, are delegated to autonomously operating functional systems (such as economy, law, politics, education, art, science, etc.), then it follows that inclusion (participation) of all persons in all functional systems has to be guaranteed (Fuchs 1996). There is therefore an equality enforced by the form of differentiation itself, which is the equality of an opportunity (not of a reality), the equality of a knowledge. And what becomes problematic then is not the case that there is inequality (it is foreseen and must be tolerated in the core area of functional differentiation) (Fuchs 1999c), but only that the opportunity for equality of inclusion is not guaranteed. The stimulability of inequality in modern society thus does not refer to factual inequalities, but to a disbalancing of opportunities, which then makes it possible to sue for re-balancing in the form of claims and claim filiations, so to speak."

This happens when (due to whatever causalities) exclusions affect a majority of functional systems, when, for example, a disability minimizes inclusion in the economy, largely excludes chances of participation in the intimate system, delays school careers or makes them impossible, in short, when a social address arises that is defective or damaged in this sense, which in more and more respects no longer benefits from general inclusion or is decisively threatened not to be able to benefit in the future."

In this sense it is diabolical. Built into the form itself is the inevitability of producing damaged addresses and the inevitability of having to avoid just such addresses. Or in other words: Modern society has to do at this point with a principled (argen) indeterminacy, with a paradox of: It cannot be, what cannot be!, but it is, what cannot be. \n\nSince paradoxes typically paralyze only observers (only for them there are paradoxes), it is to be expected that evolution (which does not know indeterminacies, it is not an observer) generates forms at this problem, which an observer can call a instead, and the assumption is that the differentiation of a system of social work realizes exactly this instead, i.e. performs the function of staging chances of re-inclusion for damaged addresses."

Such a system cannot enforce the chance of general inclusion for society, because it is itself only a subsystem among other subsystems, and it cannot include for the functional systems, let alone: force them to inclusion in any form. Its function would be precisely located at the generation or re-generation of the chance of inclusion, and even more precisely: at the generation of the condition of the possibility of this chance. This is, as will quickly be seen, a double modalization: the generation of the possibility for a possibility."

Re-inclusion (in the sense of this double modalization) then refers to what one could loosely call the tuning of social addresses, as a dressing that makes the chance for chance more probable or sometimes (as in the case of the severely disabled) opens it up in the first place. Social work is accordingly, and strictly speaking, work on social addresses and not: work on people, as formulations suggest that speak of people-processing systems. It is not about changing individuals. It is, one would think, excluded not only from logical but also from ethical considerations. Instead, the system reorganizes addressability."

It is the level of the basal self-instruction of the system by a binary code, by a strictly two-valued distinction, which is in a certain sense nihilistic, insofar as it is an in-itself distinction, a (in Spencer-Brown's terminology) continented distinction, in which every reference to one side negates the other side, but, as one might say with Hegel, in the form of a certain negation, thus not in the form of an erasure. In this way, a smooth switching back and forth between the code sides is possible, and: the exclusion of world ballast, that is, that which otherwise occurs in the world that endures the incision of the code, for example: morality. The code is extremely poor in the world, it does not offer 'rich' directives. But it is precisely this ruthlessness that gives rise to its power. Well-known examples are right/wrong (law), have/have-not (economy), immanence/transcendence (religion), true/not true (science)."

Only what can be called a case is connectable in the system and processable on the level of programs, and this also means that the decisive operation of the system is the case declaration. In the center stands the construction of faIlform world occurrences and the thereby spanned horizon of the non-faIlformity of aIthing else that happens. According to the considerations presented above, the marking case designates the defective address, i.e. a communicative structure, which is formed in the system and leads to the production of clients."

The concept of complexity thus formulates first of all the intention to see manifoldness from the point of view of its unity. The complex object must be manifold and unity at the same time.\nWe now have experience with this problem, and we can make use of it. Already on the basis of the conceptual history of *complexum*, *complexio* one can see that this problem has forced modalizations and thus simultaneous presentation on several levels. In the tradition, these were partly possibility-theoretical (*complexio contingens!*), partly epistemological (*complexe significabile!*) modalizations."

Depending on the modal-theoretical frame of reference, this reference to unity appears partly as a concomitant necessity in the contingently composed, partly as a question of securing the categorial correspondence of being and cognition when accessing the totality of content. (Today's ideas would rather correspond to a majority of \"levels of language\".) It always seems to have been an undiscussed prerequisite of the problem that it was about the unity of the complex itself. Exactly in this the perfection specific to the object was seen, that it brought multiplicity and distinctness (*multitudo et distinctio*) to an ordered unity – by the will of the creator or by the function of the imagination of the transcendental subject. And at the same time the unity of the complex subject was a guarantee for the decidability of the question whether statements contradict each other, i.e. precondition of the principle of non-contradiction. Finally, it offered to the older doctrine the starting point for cosmological explanations, about whose bases science cannot fully dispose."

But they should also not hastily stimulate an epistemological, analytic, model-theoretical, constructivist relativism, which leads into well-known dead ends and either has to assume minimal a priori or completely renounce to account for the sense in which cognition relates to reality. Instead, in the following we want to strive for a factual concept that takes up the indicated problems and at the same time clarifies those theoretical decisions by which the concept of complexity becomes relevant for other theoretical complexes."

So schreibt Niklas Luhmann mit Blick auf die Soziale Arbeit1, daß die „Ressourcenabhängigkeit dieser Bemühungen … so stark [ist], daß man zweifeln kann, ob sich ein gesellschaftliches Subsystem schon gebildet hat oder ob es sich um weit verstreute Bemühungen auf der Ebene von Interaktionen und Organisationen handelt. Deutlich erkennbar ist, daß es nicht mehr um Caritas oder um Armenpflege im Sinne der Tradition geht, sondern um Bemühungen um strukturelle Veränderungen (Stichwort: Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe). Vielleicht können wir hier ein Funktionssystem im Entstehen betrachten“ (Luhmann 1997a, 632f.). Mit dieser Form der Thematisierung wird also nicht die empirische Evidenz des Phänomens Soziale Arbeit in Frage gestellt, soweit es sich um die Ebenen Interaktion und Organisation handelt. Umstritten bleibt allein der Anspruch auf der Gesellschaftsebene. Und damit ist die Höhenlage der hier zu leistenden Analyse vorgezeichnet; sie muß auf der Ebene einer entwickelten Gesellschaftstheorie angesiedelt werden. Zu diesem Zweck soll hier auf die Systemtheorie zurückgegriffen werden, die ein begriffliches Instrumentarium bereitstellt, um die gestellte Aufgabe einer konstruktiven Lösung zuzuführen.\n"

There is therefore an equality enforced by the form of differentiation itself, which is the equality of an opportunity (not of a reality), the equality of a knowledge. And what becomes problematic then is not the case that there is inequality (it is foreseen and must be tolerated in the core area of functional differentiation) (Fuchs 1999c), but only that the opportunity for equality of 1nclusion is not guaranteed. The stimulability of inequality in modern society thus does not refer to factual inequalities, but to a disbalancing of opportunities, which then makes it possible to sue for re-balancing in the form of claims and claim filiations, so to speak."

Or in other words: Modern society has to do at this point with a principled (argen) indeterminacy, with a paradox of: It cannot be, what cannot be!, but it is, what cannot be. \n\nSince paradoxes typically paralyze only observers (only for them there are paradoxes), it is to be expected that evolution (which does not know indeterminacies, it is not an observer) generates forms at this problem, which an observer can call a instead, and the assumption is that the differentiation of a system of social work realizes exactly this instead, i.e. performs the function of staging chances of re-inclusion for damaged addresses."

Social work is accordingly, and strictly speaking, work on social addresses and not: work on people, as formulations suggest that speak of people-processing systems.

In this way, a smooth switching back and forth between the code sides is possible, and: the exclusion of world ballast, that is, that which otherwise occurs in the world that endures the incision of the code, for example: morality. The code is extremely poor in the world, it does not offer 'rich' directives. But it is precisely this ruthlessness that gives rise to its power.

The complex object must be manifold and unity at the same time.\nWe now have experience with this problem, and we can make use of it. Already on the basis of the conceptual history of *complexum*, *complexio* one can see that this problem has forced modalizations and thus simultaneous presentation on several levels.

        "text": "If one wants to bring all this to an overarching central idea, the classical problem of the unity of the manifold remains in the last stage of generalization. \"Complexity is only of importance if in a certain respect there is a high degree of complexity and in another respect there is unity.\" After all, a unified concept is only meaningful if the manifold can be treated as a unity from some point of view. The concept of complexity thus formulates first of all the intention to see manifoldness from the point of view of its unity. The complex object must be manifold and unity at the same time.\nWe now have experience with this problem, and we can make use of it. Already on the basis of the conceptual history of *complexum*, *complexio* one can see that this problem has forced modalizations and thus simultaneous presentation on several levels. In the tradition, these were partly possibility-theoretical (*complexio contingens!*), partly epistemological (*complexe significabile!*) modalizations."
