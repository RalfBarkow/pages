This basic principle means that the products and the processes of the Schillinger system tend to remain within the boundaries set by the listener’s normal cognitive capacity. I use the term cognitive capacity here to describe the whole process of listening to and understanding music. The general model of cognition and perception suggests that we listen and respond to music through instantaneous assessments of musical style, making rapid predictions as to the probability of different modes of continuation. Meyer and others suggest that the emotional response to music lies in our ability to predict the completion of a musical tendency, or to comprehend the significance of a deviation, such as the interrupted cadence (Meyer, 1994, p. 10). Drawing on information theory, which deals mathematically with the communication of information, it can be inferred that if music exceeds the listener’s cognitive thresholds, then there can be no experience based on an assessment of probability; this may explain the very limited popularity of certain styles."
