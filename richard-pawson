The new house is of brick construction, approximately 3000 square feet, and its external styling Victorian (50 degree roof pitches, gables, subdivided casement windows) and very much in keeping with the style adopted in the Southern Chiltern hills during that period.  So the predominantly red brickwork has some blue-glazed header bricks forming diamond patterns in the gables.  Internally it is built to very high modern standards including concrete floors upstairs and down, underfloor heating ('radiant heat') and, of course CAT-5 cabling throughout.  I have no training in architecture, but plenty of personal interest.  I used a building technologist to advise on building regulations.",

There's no such thing as greenfield building sites in this part of the world so we looked for a house to knock down.  We knew that the new house would have to broadly adopt the footprint of the existing house, with some scope for extension.  The house we chose had a 2x1 rectangular footprint with the major axis aligned E-W.  The plot is also long and thin, but along the road rather than perpendicular to it.  The rear of the house and plot face open fields (very close the house) and are also south facing.  This combination of features more-or-less gave us:  'south facing outdoors', 'long thin house' (sort of), 'half-hidden garden'.  The front of the house is close to the road (a country lane) separated by a waist high wall and, miraculously, the ground level is 50cm above the street.  This gives us the effect of 'private terrace on the street' and I often lean on that wall and chat with neighbours walking past. (My study also overlooks the street, which was partly to get it north-facing but also so that I can chat to passing neighbours through the open window.)",

For us this had to be the kitchen/dining room, which is the social centre of the house.  This holds the central position, with great views over the fields.  It is very much a 'farmhouse kitchen', complete with an Aga.  Off the working side of the kitchen are a laundry room and separate pantry.  Off the dining side of the kitchen are a family room, and more formal living room.  (The latter is an unusual choice  -  most people would put it off the hall.  But the reality is that arriving guests do not want to be channeled off into a room  -  they want to go into the kitchen.  Maybe later you can get them into the living room.  This arrangement helps with the 'gradient of intimacy' pattern  -  which is reinforced by deliberate changes in 'floor surface', from polished Tuscan limestone in the central areas to a similar coloured carpet in the more intimate rooms.  I also tried to use 'variable ceiling heights', though not as much as I would have liked  -  they vary from 2.4m to 2.6m, although the kitchen/dining also has an unusual light-well extending to the upstairs.

There are french doors onto a small wrought-iron balcony, which violates 'six foot balcony'.

Stain glass windows on either side of the porch provide 'filtered light'.  The porch leads through 'solid doors with glass' into a hallway, with the 'staircase as a stage' entering into it also.  But the point is that a staight line leads from the road, through the gate, porch, hall, centre of the kitchen/dining and out through the french doors to the patio and fields.  That line (which is not very long) passes through several levels of floor and ceiling, as well as multiple shades of light.  That line is the central symmetry axis of the house and it draws you straight into the heart of the house.  So many visitors have commented on this.

He would like to see it more organic, literally unfolding over many years with extensions and modifications.  However, he doesn't have to deal with the planners at South Oxfordshire District Council (known as the SODC or \"sods\", locally) -  who are amongst the most inflexible in the country.
