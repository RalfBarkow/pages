      "text": "A transgender man (i.e., someone who was born female and subsequently transitioned gender) was registered with his medical practice and the UK National Health Service as male. Having a vagina and cervix, he arranged a cervical screening test (US: Pap test).  When the test results came back suggesting abnormalities, the hospital follow up checks were significantly delayed by confusion over why a man needed cervical cancer checks."

NHS England policy for cervical screening is that those between 25 and 64 registered with a GP as female will be routinely invited for cervical screening, those registered as male won&apos;t. Transgender men can contact their GP to arrange to book a screening. Transgender men are not routinely invited to cervical screening checks and might not arrange their own.  To be clear about terminology, according to the World Health Organisation, `gender&apos; is used to describe the characteristics of women and men that are socially constructed, while `sex&apos; refers to those that are biologically determined. People are born female or male, but learn to be girls and boys who grow into women and men. This learned behaviour makes up gender identity and determines gender roles."
