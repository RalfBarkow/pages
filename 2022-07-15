        "text": "> A few years ago, I developed some ideas that would lay the foundations of a new theoretical approach to agnostically quantify the amount of historical information or pathway assembly information contained within an object. I reasoned this could be achieved by considering how the object can be deconstructed into its irreducible parts, and then evaluating the minimum number of steps necessary to reconstruct the object along any pathway. As a chemist, I naively thought about taking a molecule and cutting it up into pieces such that I could easily use the shortest route to reassemble the molecule. In thinking about this approach, I realized the analysis of pathway assembly is done by the recursive deconstruction of a given object using shortest paths, and this can be used to evaluate the effective pathway assembly index for that object [19]. To take this forward I developed [[Assembly Theory]] within my team and collaborators [20]. In developing pathway assembly, I was motivated to create an intrinsic measure of an object forming through random processes, where the only knowledge required of the system is the basic building blocks and the permitted ways of joining structures together."
