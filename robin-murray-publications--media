[https://cloud.owncube.com/s/MwKKQ2ndZfLirqH pdf]\n>Of the immediate political issues now before us, there is one group that involves branches of production unified by a common dependence on land and natural resources. I am  thinking of the international oil price rise . .  exploitation of the North Sea . . housing crisis and urban property speculation . . rise in food prices in this country, co-existing with agricultural surpluses, and famine in underdeveloped countries. The productive sectors concerned are agriculture, urban property, and mineral production . . . It is striking . . that these sectors often appear at the centre of the crisis. Some liberal theorists even locate the crisis in the control of these sectors by landlords: the property speculators in the British crisis, the Arab sheiks in the general rate of inflation and the declining rate of profit, the latifundistas in the crises of inflation and poverty in Latin America . Other liberals - particularly social democrats - see the control of landed property as a way out of crisis . . . \"solutions\" have been contested by the labour movement in many immediate ways: in tenants' struggles, in campaigns for price freezes, in demands for the nationalisation of . . . land . . . Unfortunately our general theory of the relation of landed property to capitalist development has not been developed in tandem . . . We need a general theory of modern landed property, and its concomitant, a theory of rent.\n\n\n"

[https://cloud.owncube.com/s/ockj5wxW4SaNtCA pdf]\n> In the first part of this essay I approached the relation of capital to the land principally through a discussion of the form taken by this relation in the value sphere - namely rent. I suggested that we could only understand this form - its origins. its limits and tendencies - if we analysed it in terms of a) the law of value in the capitalist economy as a whole, and b) the contradiction between use value and exchange value in the landed branches of production. The second of these requires clarification.\n> There are two characteristics which distinguish land as a· use value in the agricultural labour process. First it is possible for labour to produce its own means of subsistence on the land with few if any means of production. This poses an immediate challenge to a society that demands that labour be separated from its means of subsistence so that it is forced to sell itself as labour power on the market.\n> Second, from the point of view of capitalist agriculture, land as a use value {and its twin partners, climate and present barriers to the increase in output per acre. This holds for all parts of the production process. Agriculture is a transforming industry.\n\n"

When local councils imposed financial cuts from 1980 onwards, they argued that the cuts were necessary because of overspending. This text takes the view that monetarist policies are implicated in the decline in public services and critically evaluates the effects of monetarism on working people’s lives, organisations and throughout the welfare state. It poses the question as to whether a different kind of economics was needed that was geared to need rather than to monetarist philosophy?\n\n\n"

[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1759-5436.1985.mp16001008.x/abstract webpage]\n>Summary: London — still one of the world's major imperial capitals — is facing a severe economic crisis, with 400,000 people unemployed, mass poverty, and large scale de-industrialisation. This is partly the result of London's changing place in the international division of labour, particularly within the EEC. Equally important is the widespread restructuring of its service and industrial base induced by the international crisis of profitability, and deepened by British monetarism. The metropolitan council of London, the GLC, has been implementing an economic strategy which counters market restructuring with what it calls ‘restructuring for labour’.\n\n\n"

These methods come from many fields – public policy, design, technology, business, community organising, the professions and social entrepreneurship.Some are used consciously as distinct methods, but many are not. Indeed, our research suggests that relatively few people working in the field have had the chance to reflect on the methods that they already use, and that even fewer are aware of the other methods in neighbouring fields which they could be using. As a whole, the field is less self‐aware than business, medicine or science. This is in part a symptom of relative newness. But one of the premises of this project is that greater awareness of methods will improve the practice, and success, of social innovation in fields as diverse as ageing, the environment, mental health, education and welfare.\n\n\n"

Sometimes referred to as the Third Sector, they in fact operate across sectors, in parts of the state, the grant economy, the collaborative household economy and in the market as social enterprises. While there is a long-standing economic and managerial literature on the market economy, and methods of operating within it, as well as a complementary body of work on public finance and public sector management, there is remarkably little on the distinctive character of social ventures and the social economy. Yet this economy and its ventures are set to play a critical role in addressing many of the most urgent contemporary problems, from climate change to chronic disease, and from social welfare to new forms of consumption. This volume focuses on how to establish and grow a social venture. The authors have done a remarkable job in scouring the landscape of entrepreneurs and campaigners, organisations and movements – in the UK and internationally – to present a rich set of accounts of how social innovation actually happens.. More than an inspiring set of stories, it is a guide.\n\n\n"

[https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/co-operation_in_the_age_of_google.pdf pdf]\n>What is the way forward for the co-operative sector? Commissioned by Co-operatives UK, Robin Murray – a co-operative innovator and key thinker behind Fairtrade, Twin Trading and much more besides – has produced a radical vision of the how the co-operative sector can expand in the 21st Century. Co-operation in the age of Google shows that we are living at a time of profound transformation. The information and communication revolution, widespread concerns about private sector greed, public sector finances and impending climate chaos present a wide range of possibilities for co-operative expansion. But Robin says the co-operative sector is not yet in a position to make the most of these opportunities. It needs to be more innovative, more integrated, more internationalist, to get better infrastructure and to find ‘the idea’ that can mobilise support for co-operation. The review proposes a series of practical initiatives for 2011 and 2012 to strengthen the co-operative sector.\n\n\n"

[https://www.lwbooks.co.uk/sites/default/files/nf8485_11murray_gilbert_goffey.pdf pdf]\n>*Abstract - One of the UK’s leading radical economists discusses the history of post-Fordism as both a concept and a set of economic practices, with specific reference to his role as an innovative municipal policy-maker at the GLC in the 1980s and subsequently. The interview explores the ways in which post-Fordism has mutated since the 1980s, before moving on to discuss the attention economy and the death of the brand. It then looks at the future of co-operatives and ideas of co-operation in the age of social media, before investigating in more detail the politics of platforms and the democratic possibilities opened up by peer-to-peer technologies. Murray makes a convincing case that we have now entered the epoch of ‘post-post-Fordism’: the era of platforms. The discussion is framed with reference to Deleuze’s ‘control societies’ hypothesis, which is the subject of the themed journal issue in which the interview appears. *\n\n\n"

This is partly the result of London's changing place in the international division of labour, particularly within the EEC. Equally important is the widespread restructuring of its service and industrial base induced by the international crisis of profitability, and deepened by British monetarism. The metropolitan council of London, the GLC, has been implementing an economic strategy which counters market restructuring with what it calls ‘restructuring for labour’.\n\nRobin Murray (1985), Introduction, The London industrial strategy, London: Greater London Council, 1-64.

These methods come from many fields – public policy, design, technology, business, community organising, the professions and social entrepreneurship.Some are used consciously as distinct methods, but many are not. Indeed, our research suggests that relatively few people working in the field have had the chance to reflect on the methods that they already use, and that even fewer are aware of the other methods in neighbouring fields which they could be using. As a whole, the field is less self‐aware than business, medicine or science. This is in part a symptom of relative newness. But one of the premises of this project is that greater awareness of methods will improve the practice, and success, of social innovation in fields as diverse as ageing, the environment, mental health, education and welfare.\n\nRobin Murray (2009), Danger and opportunity - Crisis and the new social economy, NESTA/Young Foundation. https://youngfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Danger-and-Opportunity-September-2009.pdf\n\n>This pamphlet argues that the early years of the 21st century are witnessing the emergence of a new kind of economy that has profound implications for the future of public services as well as for the daily life of citizens. This emerging economy can be seen in many fields, including the environment, care, education, welfare, food and energy. It combines some old elements and many new ones. I describe it as a ‘social economy’ because it melds features which are very different from economies based on the production and consumption of commodities.\n\nRobin Murray, Julie Caulier-Grice & Geoff Mulgan (2009), Social venturing, NESTA/Young Foundation https://youngfoundation.org/publications/social-venturing/\n\n>The past thirty years have seen a remarkable growth of social ventures in both the developed and developing worlds. Sometimes referred to as the Third Sector, they in fact operate across sectors, in parts of the state, the grant economy, the collaborative household economy and in the market as social enterprises. While there is a long-standing economic and managerial literature on the market economy, and methods of operating within it, as well as a complementary body of work on public finance and public sector management, there is remarkably little on the distinctive character of social ventures and the social economy. Yet this economy and its ventures are set to play a critical role in addressing many of the most urgent contemporary problems, from climate change to chronic disease, and from social welfare to new forms of consumption. This volume focuses on how to establish and grow a social venture. The authors have done a remarkable job in scouring the landscape of entrepreneurs and campaigners, organisations and movements – in the UK and internationally – to present a rich set of accounts of how social innovation actually happens.. More than an inspiring set of stories, it is a guide.\n\nRobin Murray, Julie Caulier-Grice & Geoff Mulgan (2010), The open book of social innovation, NESTA/Young Foundation. https://youngfoundation.org/publications/the-open-book-of-social-innovation/\n\nRobin Murray (2010), Cooperation in the age of Google - A review for Co-operatives UK - draft for comments, London: Cooperatives UK. https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/co-operation_in_the_age_of_google.pdf\n\n>What is the way forward for the co-operative sector? Commissioned by Co-operatives UK, Robin Murray – a co-operative innovator and key thinker behind Fairtrade, Twin Trading and much more besides – has produced a radical vision of the how the co-operative sector can expand in the 21st Century. Co-operation in the age of Google shows that we are living at a time of profound transformation. The information and communication revolution, widespread concerns about private sector greed, public sector finances and impending climate chaos present a wide range of possibilities for co-operative expansion. But Robin says the co-operative sector is not yet in a position to make the most of these opportunities. It needs to be more innovative, more integrated, more internationalist, to get better infrastructure and to find ‘the idea’ that can mobilise support for co-operation. The review proposes a series of practical initiatives for 2011 and 2012 to strengthen the co-operative sector.\n\nRobin Murray (2011), [The next ten years], a talk at Co-op Congress.

They ask of any project, or pilot, will it scale? Within civil economy movements, similar questions arise – and there are a number which have split on the subject, one group going for scale (because of its ‘greater impact’) even if it means reducing the qualitative difference of the alternative, another resisting the dilution of the idea that inspires the project.\n\n>Without going into these particular arguments - and it may be a question of both/and rather than either/or – I have felt uneasy with the notion of scale. It reflects the era of mass production which was dominated by the concept of scale. It implies replication, standardization, and power. It is a linear, mechanical concept.\n\nRobin Murray, Jeremy Gilbert & Andrew Goffey (2014), Post-post-Fordism in the era of platforms.

The interview explores the ways in which post-Fordism has mutated since the 1980s, before moving on to discuss the attention economy and the death of the brand. It then looks at the future of co-operatives and ideas of co-operation in the age of social media, before investigating in more detail the politics of platforms and the democratic possibilities opened up by peer-to-peer technologies. Murray makes a convincing case that we have now entered the epoch of ‘post-post-Fordism’: the era of platforms. The discussion is framed with reference to Deleuze’s ‘control societies’ hypothesis, which is the subject of the themed journal issue in which the interview appears. *\n\nRobin Murray (2015), 'Comments of Pat (Conaty) and David (Bollier) Open Cooperativism report' (Commons Strategies Group, 2014).

When local councils imposed financial cuts from 1980 onwards, they argued that the cuts were necessary because of overspending. This text takes the view that monetarist policies are implicated in the decline in public services and critically evaluates the effects of monetarism on working people’s lives, organisations and throughout the welfare state. It poses the question as to whether a different kind of economics was needed that was geared to need rather than to monetarist philosophy?\n\n\n"

This is partly the result of London's changing place in the international division of labour, particularly within the EEC. Equally important is the widespread restructuring of its service and industrial base induced by the international crisis of profitability, and deepened by British monetarism. The metropolitan council of London, the GLC, has been implementing an economic strategy which counters market restructuring with what it calls ‘restructuring for labour’.\n\n\n"

These methods come from many fields – public policy, design, technology, business, community organising, the professions and social entrepreneurship.Some are used consciously as distinct methods, but many are not. Indeed, our research suggests that relatively few people working in the field have had the chance to reflect on the methods that they already use, and that even fewer are aware of the other methods in neighbouring fields which they could be using. As a whole, the field is less self‐aware than business, medicine or science. This is in part a symptom of relative newness. But one of the premises of this project is that greater awareness of methods will improve the practice, and success, of social innovation in fields as diverse as ageing, the environment, mental health, education and welfare.\n\nRobin Murray (2009), Danger and opportunity - Crisis and the new social economy, NESTA/Young Foundation. https://youngfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Danger-and-Opportunity-September-2009.pdf\n\n>This pamphlet argues that the early years of the 21st century are witnessing the emergence of a new kind of economy that has profound implications for the future of public services as well as for the daily life of citizens. This emerging economy can be seen in many fields, including the environment, care, education, welfare, food and energy. It combines some old elements and many new ones. I describe it as a ‘social economy’ because it melds features which are very different from economies based on the production and consumption of commodities.\n\nRobin Murray, Julie Caulier-Grice & Geoff Mulgan (2009), Social venturing, NESTA/Young Foundation https://youngfoundation.org/publications/social-venturing/\n\n>The past thirty years have seen a remarkable growth of social ventures in both the developed and developing worlds. Sometimes referred to as the Third Sector, they in fact operate across sectors, in parts of the state, the grant economy, the collaborative household economy and in the market as social enterprises. While there is a long-standing economic and managerial literature on the market economy, and methods of operating within it, as well as a complementary body of work on public finance and public sector management, there is remarkably little on the distinctive character of social ventures and the social economy. Yet this economy and its ventures are set to play a critical role in addressing many of the most urgent contemporary problems, from climate change to chronic disease, and from social welfare to new forms of consumption. This volume focuses on how to establish and grow a social venture. The authors have done a remarkable job in scouring the landscape of entrepreneurs and campaigners, organisations and movements – in the UK and internationally – to present a rich set of accounts of how social innovation actually happens.. More than an inspiring set of stories, it is a guide.\n\nRobin Murray, Julie Caulier-Grice & Geoff Mulgan (2010), The open book of social innovation, NESTA/Young Foundation. https://youngfoundation.org/publications/the-open-book-of-social-innovation/\n\nRobin Murray (2010), Cooperation in the age of Google - A review for Co-operatives UK - draft for comments, London: Cooperatives UK. https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/co-operation_in_the_age_of_google.pdf\n\n>What is the way forward for the co-operative sector? Commissioned by Co-operatives UK, Robin Murray – a co-operative innovator and key thinker behind Fairtrade, Twin Trading and much more besides – has produced a radical vision of the how the co-operative sector can expand in the 21st Century. Co-operation in the age of Google shows that we are living at a time of profound transformation. The information and communication revolution, widespread concerns about private sector greed, public sector finances and impending climate chaos present a wide range of possibilities for co-operative expansion. But Robin says the co-operative sector is not yet in a position to make the most of these opportunities. It needs to be more innovative, more integrated, more internationalist, to get better infrastructure and to find ‘the idea’ that can mobilise support for co-operation.

This emerging economy can be seen in many fields, including the environment, care, education, welfare, food and energy. It combines some old elements and many new ones.

Sometimes referred to as the Third Sector, they in fact operate across sectors, in parts of the state, the grant economy, the collaborative household economy and in the market as social enterprises. While there is a long-standing economic and managerial literature on the market economy, and methods of operating within it, as well as a complementary body of work on public finance and public sector management, there is remarkably little on the distinctive character of social ventures and the social economy. Yet this economy and its ventures are set to play a critical role in addressing many of the most urgent contemporary problems, from climate change to chronic disease, and from social welfare to new forms of consumption. This volume focuses on how to establish and grow a social venture.

Commissioned by Co-operatives UK, Robin Murray – a co-operative innovator and key thinker behind Fairtrade, Twin Trading and much more besides – has produced a radical vision of the how the co-operative sector can expand in the 21st Century. Co-operation in the age of Google shows that we are living at a time of profound transformation. The information and communication revolution, widespread concerns about private sector greed, public sector finances and impending climate chaos present a wide range of possibilities for co-operative expansion. But Robin says the co-operative sector is not yet in a position to make the most of these opportunities. It needs to be more innovative, more integrated, more internationalist, to get better infrastructure and to find ‘the idea’ that can mobilise support for co-operation. The review proposes a series of practical initiatives for 2011 and 2012 to strengthen the co-operative sector.\n\nRobin Murray (2011), [The next ten years], a talk at Co-op Congress.

They ask of any project, or pilot, will it scale?

The interview explores the ways in which post-Fordism has mutated since the 1980s, before moving on to discuss the attention economy and the death of the brand. It then looks at the future of co-operatives and ideas of co-operation in the age of social media, before investigating in more detail the politics of platforms and the democratic possibilities opened up by peer-to-peer technologies. Murray makes a convincing case that we have now entered the epoch of ‘post-post-Fordism’: the era of platforms. The discussion is framed with reference to Deleuze’s ‘control societies’ hypothesis, which is the subject of the themed journal issue in which the interview appears. *\n\nRobin Murray (2015), 'Comments of Pat (Conaty) and David (Bollier) Open Cooperativism report' (Commons Strategies Group, 2014).

The Dutch social enterprise, Buurtzorg has developed a striking fourth model, that now employs 9,000 care workers, and according to Ernst & Young has cut the cost of care to the Dutch healthcare system by 40%. Its key feature is the self management of care by teams of 10-12 staff . .

The interview explores the ways in which post-Fordism has mutated since the 1980s, before moving on to discuss the attention economy and the death of the brand. It then looks at the future of co-operatives and ideas of co-operation in the age of social media, before investigating in more detail the politics of platforms and the democratic possibilities opened up by peer-to-peer technologies. Murray makes a convincing case that we have now entered the epoch of ‘post-post-Fordism’: the era of platforms. The discussion is framed with reference to Deleuze’s ‘control societies’ hypothesis, which is the subject of the themed journal issue in which the interview appears. *\n\n\n"

The Dutch social enterprise, Buurtzorg has developed a striking fourth model, that now employs 9,000 care workers, and according to Ernst & Young has cut the cost of care to the Dutch healthcare system by 40%.

First it is possible for labour to produce its own means of subsistence on the land with few if any means of production. This poses an immediate challenge to a society that demands that labour be separated from its means of subsistence so that it is forced to sell itself as labour power on the market.\n> Second, from the point of view of capitalist agriculture, land as a use value {and its twin partners, climate and present barriers to the increase in output per acre.

[https://cloud.owncube.com/s/MwKKQ2ndZfLirqH pdf]\n>Of the immediate political issues now before us, there is one group that involves branches of production unified by a common dependence on land and natural resources. I am  thinking of the international oil price rise . .  exploitation of the North Sea . . housing crisis and urban property speculation . . rise in food prices in this country, co-existing with agricultural surpluses, and famine in underdeveloped countries. The productive sectors concerned are agriculture, urban property, and mineral production . . . It is striking . . that these sectors often appear at the centre of the crisis. Some liberal theorists even locate the crisis in the control of these sectors by landlords: the property speculators in the British crisis, the Arab sheiks in the general rate of inflation and the declining rate of profit, the latifundistas in the crises of inflation and poverty in Latin America . Other liberals - particularly social democrats - see the control of landed property as a way out of crisis . . . \"solutions\" have been contested by the labour movement in many immediate ways: in tenants' struggles, in campaigns for price freezes, in demands for the nationalisation of . . . land . . . Unfortunately our general theory of the relation of landed property to capitalist development has not been developed in tandem . . . We need a general theory of modern landed property, and its concomitant, a theory of rent.\n\n\n"

These methods come from many fields – public policy, design, technology, business, community organising, the professions and social entrepreneurship.Some are used consciously as distinct methods, but many are not. Indeed, our research suggests that relatively few people working in the field have had the chance to reflect on the methods that they already use, and that even fewer are aware of the other methods in neighbouring fields which they could be using. As a whole, the field is less self‐aware than business, medicine or science. This is in part a symptom of relative newness. But one of the premises of this project is that greater awareness of methods will improve the practice, and success, of social innovation in fields as diverse as ageing, the environment, mental health, education and welfare.\n\n\n"

Sometimes referred to as the Third Sector, they in fact operate across sectors, in parts of the state, the grant economy, the collaborative household economy and in the market as social enterprises. While there is a long-standing economic and managerial literature on the market economy, and methods of operating within it, as well as a complementary body of work on public finance and public sector management, there is remarkably little on the distinctive character of social ventures and the social economy. Yet this economy and its ventures are set to play a critical role in addressing many of the most urgent contemporary problems, from climate change to chronic disease, and from social welfare to new forms of consumption. This volume focuses on how to establish and grow a social venture. The authors have done a remarkable job in scouring the landscape of entrepreneurs and campaigners, organisations and movements – in the UK and internationally – to present a rich set of accounts of how social innovation actually happens.. More than an inspiring set of stories, it is a guide.\n\n\n"

[https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/co-operation_in_the_age_of_google.pdf pdf]\n>What is the way forward for the co-operative sector? Commissioned by Co-operatives UK, Robin Murray – a co-operative innovator and key thinker behind Fairtrade, Twin Trading and much more besides – has produced a radical vision of the how the co-operative sector can expand in the 21st Century. Co-operation in the age of Google shows that we are living at a time of profound transformation. The information and communication revolution, widespread concerns about private sector greed, public sector finances and impending climate chaos present a wide range of possibilities for co-operative expansion. But Robin says the co-operative sector is not yet in a position to make the most of these opportunities. It needs to be more innovative, more integrated, more internationalist, to get better infrastructure and to find ‘the idea’ that can mobilise support for co-operation. The review proposes a series of practical initiatives for 2011 and 2012 to strengthen the co-operative sector.\n\n\n"

BALTA webinar, March 18th 2013, RM edited version, 16th April 2013.\n*Robin’s original document was difficult to read - very long line length. This version has been reformatted, Mike Hales 25 October 2018. But no edits. Original file received from Tim Crabtree, October 2018, original filename: BALTA - Robin Murray's Webinar Talk on evolutionary growth 16.4.13.pdf.* [https://cloud.owncube.com/s/Yp6zDKtXLXXLFRb pdf]\n>Sometimes – particularly among policy makers – this process is described as scaling. They ask of any project, or pilot, will it scale? Within civil economy movements, similar questions arise – and there are a number which have split on the subject, one group going for scale (because of its ‘greater impact’) even if it means reducing the qualitative difference of the alternative, another resisting the dilution of the idea that inspires the project.\n>Without going into these particular arguments - and it may be a question of both/and rather than either/or – I have felt uneasy with the notion of scale. It reflects the era of mass production which was dominated by the concept of scale. It implies replication, standardization, and power. It is a linear, mechanical concept.\n\n\n"

The issue has been not the model of care, but its economics . . The Dutch social enterprise, Buurtzorg has developed a striking fourth model, that now employs 9,000 care workers, and according to Ernst & Young has cut the cost of care to the Dutch healthcare system by 40%. Its key feature is the self management of care by teams of 10-12 staff . . There are three key concepts that lie at the heart of the Buurtzorg model: distributed systems, platform, support\n\n\n"

When local councils imposed financial cuts from 1980 onwards, they argued that the cuts were necessary because of overspending. This text takes the view that monetarist policies are implicated in the decline in public services and critically evaluates the effects of monetarism on working people’s lives, organisations and throughout the welfare state. It poses the question as to whether a different kind of economics was needed that was geared to need rather than to monetarist philosophy?\n\n\n"
