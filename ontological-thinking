Where my observations conflicted they were either associated as essentially meaningless differences (some birds are black, some are brown, and some are multi-coloured. Whatever), or ignored (all birds go \"tweet tweet\", so they don't go \"quack quack\"). All the time I thought like this I really knew very little about birds. At some point in my youth, however, someone named some types of bird for me. This is a robin, that is a blackbird, over there is a duck.  Suddenly I was able to associate my observations on a much finer grained level. A robin has a red front, a blackbird is black, a duck goes \"quack quack\", but they are all also birds.

Only once someone knows that such a concept as a \"list\" or \"hash table\" exists, can they start associating observed behaviour, needs and products with it.  The alternative is to associate all observations with just \"software\". 'Software is infinitely flexible; in this case we need some \"software\" which does...'

When I was little and saw something hopping about in the garden or flying in the sky it was just a \"bird\", so anything I learned from watching these strange creatures was just associated with \"bird\". Where my observations conflicted they were either associated as essentially meaningless differences (some birds are black, some are brown, and some are multi-coloured. Whatever), or ignored (all birds go \"tweet tweet\", so they don't go \"quack quack\"). All the time I thought like this I really knew very little about birds. At some point in my youth, however, someone named some types of bird for me. This is a robin, that is a blackbird, over there is a duck.  Suddenly I was able to associate my observations on a much finer grained level. A robin has a red front, a blackbird is black, a duck goes \"quack quack\", but they are all also birds.

The alternative is to associate all observations with just \"software\". 'Software is infinitely flexible; in this case we need some \"software\" which does...'
