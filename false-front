Men all over the world are reacting with the greatest aggression to the shaking of this binary and here archic gender order by the feminist movements and the economic structural change in the last decades. What is at stake here is the innermost core of their sense of self, which is fiercely defended, as is abundantly clear from the frightening increase in sexualized violence around the world.
