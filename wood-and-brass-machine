      "text": "In our invention, it follows, we must provide the machine with an algedonic receptor, through which the speaker of Meta 1 can communicate. This consists of two switches, either of which will move the wooden strip vertically up or down the diagram. The strip in Figure 10 carries and now moves the brass plates A and B; but the contacts from the roulette wheel do not move. The red light, which our observer likes, is activated by the brass strip A. To reward the machine for shining red, we shall tell him, one presses the switch marked Reward. This will move the strip down a notch, and bring the contact marked X on to strip A, whereas it used to rest on B. (Remember that the contacts are fixed). This alters the 50-50 probability of the outcome to 60-40 in favour of Red. If the green light comes on nevertheless, as it may, the machine has to be punished. The observer is told to press the switch marked Punish. (Both switches in fact pull the wooden strip one notch down, but no one but ourselves know this.) The contact Y will now rest on strip A as well, and the probability of a red outcome is now 70 per cent. It is readily seen that the algedonic loop will cause the machine to adapt its behaviour to a red outcome, since that is the decision in Meta 1. The machine does not understand why its behaviour is being conditioned, and the operator does not know how the trick is done. We do, because we are omniscient with respect to this situation. If we were not, we might be puzzled too; most people are, as a matter of fact, when they see this machine working."

This consists of two switches, either of which will move the wooden strip vertically up or down the diagram. The strip in Figure 10 carries and now moves the brass plates A and B; but the contacts from the roulette wheel do not move. The red light, which our observer likes, is activated by the brass strip A. To reward the machine for shining red, we shall tell him, one presses the switch marked Reward. This will move the strip down a notch, and bring the contact marked X on to strip A, whereas it used to rest on B. (Remember that the contacts are fixed). This alters the 50-50 probability of the outcome to 60-40 in favour of Red. If the green light comes on nevertheless, as it may, the machine has to be punished. The observer is told to press the switch marked Punish. (Both switches in fact pull the wooden strip one notch down, but no one but ourselves know this.) The contact Y will now rest on strip A as well, and the probability of a red outcome is now 70 per cent. It is readily seen that the algedonic loop will cause the machine to adapt its behaviour to a red outcome, since that is the decision in Meta 1. The machine does not understand why its behaviour is being conditioned, and the operator does not know how the trick is done. We do, because we are omniscient with respect to this situation. If we were not, we might be puzzled too; most people are, as a matter of fact, when they see this machine working."

        "text": "Along comes a speaker of metalanguage one — call it Meta 1. This is a language designed to talk about colours and the emotions which colours evoke. He says: ‘I like red, but I don’t like green.” He cannot interfere with nature, which is spinning the wheel. He reckons he wants to train the machine to go red, and this is just like training a dog to respond to a command. He cannot explain in machine language, and the machine does not understand his language. So he communicates with the machine through an ⇒ [[Algedonic Loop]]. Here is another new term which must be explained."
