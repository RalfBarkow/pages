At an average age of 50 and 30 years, respectively, the state's coal and gas plants are reaching the end of their useful lives."

Then, when energy demand goes through the roof during a heat wave or cold snap, the state will have more energy flowing through its grid and the option to redirect power as a last resort."

Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston, claims the battery analogy is &quot;nonsense&quot; because miners don't store and release energy, but rather only promise to stop consuming when it's urgently needed elsewhere. And he disputes the idea that crypto mining will bring additional energy generation to the grid, which he describes as misdirection designed to distract from the price increases people will incur due to an overall rise in energy demand."

Miners in the state are currently using around 2 gigawatts (GW) of energy, with peak capacity for the state topping out at 80 GW. By 2026 it's estimated that Texas bitcoin miners will draw as much as 29 GWfour times as much as the whole of New York City."
