Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an [[umbrella term]] for the [[science]] of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory wikipedia]"

Von Neumann's original proof used the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] on continuous mappings into compact [[convex set]]s, which became a standard method in game theory and [[mathematical economics]]. \n"

The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty."
