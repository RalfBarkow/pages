Identifying two additions does not necessarily imply two simplification steps. It does imply two structural distinctions, otherwise the parentheses are not needed. Without an ability to count, we cannot identify two steps; both must occur outside of time and outside of structure. [[Structural Changes]] are usually identified as steps counted using ordinal numbers (first and second) which do not require the inductive whole number sequence.
