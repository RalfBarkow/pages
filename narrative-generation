HEFTI uses genetic algorithms at its core to [[recombine]] and evaluate story components generated from a set of story templates. The system allows authors to rely on HEFTI to perform recombination, mutation and selection operations that generate logically congruent variants of the original story via traversal, generation and deletion of (links in) the story elements."
