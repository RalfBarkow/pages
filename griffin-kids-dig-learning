Guided by our intention, 'to awaken wonder and harness the dominant themes', our teachers employed their own creative genius to weave in elements of the DiG that they thought they could manage or wanted to tinker with first. They were united in their desire to embrace the Designed InGenuity Learning Framework in their classrooms yet experimented differently. "

Time each week intentionally dedicated to sharing of ideas, experiments, voicing vulnerability and delighting in surprises as our teachers experimented. Upon reflection, we now understand that this is crucial construct in cultivating thriving innovation. "

As they researched together, learners were encouraged to boldly shared their deep interests when their curiosity was piqued. They then dug deeper in a guided way in order to unearth delights to share. During their journey, the Year Four teachers consciously sought to embed the dominant themes of the DiG experience that they had identified. They allowed time for their learners to share their authentic voice, they built deeper personal connections through vulnerability, they shifted mindsets as they learned in pods and the trust within the learning community flourished.

Some created homework DiGs, others linked their base word to their curriculum, some used a DiG to explore the transition to high school, others harnessed the power of the dominant themes in their classrooms. Each DiG revealed remarkable stories about learners and their learning and we started to get a real sense of how Designed InGenuity might assist us to reimagine learning. "

A large proportion of our teaching staff have now experienced a DiG for themselves and are finding the courage to experiment. As a Leadership Team, we’re not orchestrating the implementation, many are propelling their own bold experiments. We’re simply helping to support courageous teacher exploration through time to share authentic voice, vulnerability, creative genius and joy. We’re giving the teachers ‘airtime’, deeply listening as they share their journey and clarify their own thinking, much in the same way as learning happens in a DiG. We are curating a culture for innovation."

Are we harnessing the dominant themes?’ These are our signposts of success. Using the three [[Learning Questions]], we’re in a constant cycle of research and reflection, digging into how DiGs might translate into the classroom and power-up inquiry pedagogy. There’s a sense of a collective emergence of a different kind of learning, a reimagining of what school could look like and a deeper understanding of what learning in powerful ways can do for learners.

A large proportion of our teaching staff have now experienced a DiG for themselves and are finding the courage to experiment. As a Leadership Team, we’re not orchestrating the implementation, many are propelling their own bold experiments. We’re simply helping to support courageous teacher exploration through time to share authentic voice, vulnerability, creative genius and joy. We’re giving the teachers ‘airtime’, deeply listening as they share their journey and clarify their own thinking, much in the same way as learning happens in a DiG. We are curating a culture for innovation."

As they researched together, learners were encouraged to boldly shared their deep interests when their curiosity was piqued. They then dug deeper in a guided way in order to unearth delights to share. During their journey, the Year Four teachers consciously sought to embed the dominant themes of the DiG experience that they had identified. They allowed time for their learners to share their authentic voice, they built deeper personal connections through vulnerability, they shifted mindsets as they learned in pods and the trust within the learning community flourished.

Each DiG revealed remarkable stories about learners and their learning and we started to get a real sense of how Designed InGenuity might assist us to reimagine learning. "
