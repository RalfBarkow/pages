        "text": "In these situations, it is good to review the language that is used to talk about distinctions. Let’s see… “distinctions separate a space into two disjoint pieces”, “distinctions are the boundaries between such pieces”, “distinction is perfect continence”. It seems like there is a theme of enclosure, or even containment. The selector `contents` suggests itself. However, it is not clear that it is a good choice. This is because the contents of a distinction can only be accessed by crossing the distinction. As such, `contents` is intention obscuring because it seems to indicate it is fine to know about the contents of a distinction without crossing it — `contents` does not have strong encapsulation connotations. But not all is lost since we did mention the act of crossing distinctions. Thus, we will choose the verb instead of the noun, and send the message `[[cross]]` instead. If we let it be an accessor, then we will have an intention revealing instance name too."
