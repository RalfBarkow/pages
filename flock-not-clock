In Chapter 2, you’ll learn that defining your vision—your desired future state—is precise, demanding, and ultimately rewarding work. We will show you how to align all aspects of your organization to bring about this future, so your vision needs to be motivating, simple, and measurable.\nMission (M): The actions you take, repeatedly, to bring about your vision. In Chapter 3, we’ll make sure you are not putting together a hackneyed hodgepodge of biz speak. Your mission statements will be clear, concise, and measurable.\nCapacity (C): The systems that provide readiness to execute mission. We will examine how to measure the organizational capacity required to execute your vision day in and day out.\nLearning (L): Continuous modification of mental models based on feedback from the external environment."
