This virtual environment was developed from 3D models, later exported to the Unity 3D video game engine, in this interface the functions are programmed that allow the user to interact with the robot according to the movements and trajectories performed by the user in the work environment. A MYO Armband sensor is used to operate the position and orientation of the end effector of the robot within the environment and the Oculus Riff DK2 virtual reality glasses are used to visualize the entire space, with a first-person perspective. As a result, a computational tool is obtained that allows generating trajectories, recording them, simulating them and generating the script or programming code to be implement in the robotic manipulator controller.\n"
