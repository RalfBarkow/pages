      "text": "Another fortuitous meeting for me emerged in April 2019 in Dayton, Oregon. I had organised QASSP's third study tour to the USA to investigate the impact of technology on education. The tour saw the group visit Apple Park, the AltSchool, Stanford University, the University of Oregon,  Microsoft and Amazon. "

      "text": "The opportunity to meet Thompson Morrison came via an internet search that presented an organisiation by the name of Innovate Oregon. My email request for assistance for a school visit in Portland presented a chance to experience Dayton Junior and High School. (I've since learned that the answer is always 'yes'). It was an overcast morning in April as the coach pulled up at a school in a small rural town after a drive of about 45 minutes from Portland. "

      "text": "While I was in conversation with Thompson as the students shared their work with the study tour group in an [[In and Out]], further curiosity was sparked. Why was this tech guy so invested in learning in this small rural high school? And I sensed it was not to 'make a dollar' like the group had learned at the AltSchool in San Francisco. That startup had reportedly raised $175 million in venture capital. Dayton was a public school... in rural Oregon! The school didn't have impressive amounts of venture capital attached to it. I treasure that initial meeting and conversation."

      "text": "What really stood out was the level of engagement of teachers and students who were equally thrilled for the opportunity to tell their story. Student agency was palpable. There was that feeling in the school that learning was [[Coming Alive]], and not dulled by test scores. The teachers leaned into their work in a way I'd only occasionally experienced. Researchers might recognize it as [[Collective Teacher Efficacy]]."

      "text": "Also leaving a lasting impression on me was the principal of the school, Jami Fluke. Jami spoke with passion and shed a tear when she recognised that having an international group visiting the school was part of the audacious aspiration she and Thompson had for the school. She remembered she wanted the work being undertaken in Dayton to be of international significance. That day she was talking to a group of Australians! "

I was curious and had a sense I needed to be [[Leaning into Meaning]]. This visit was rated the most important of the study tour by those learning together and the catalyst for implementing Designed Ingenuity in Australia."
