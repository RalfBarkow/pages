We are now at a constitutional moment—a time when we can all demand better from the companies that govern our lives. This book provides a guide to a new constitutionalism: real limits on power that protect human rights in a decentralized environment. Ultimately, it provides a comprehensive argument about how we should expect the governance of online social spaces to be more legitimate – and particularly, how we might develop new forms of due process for the algorithmic and human decision making systems that rule our digital lives.
