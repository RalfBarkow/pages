This term has been used in a preliminary, very fuzzy form that relies on intuitive understanding, but in such generality it cannot push the analysis further. The question of what 'world' means in the context of and in contact with the material we encounter as the semantic sediment of apotaxis can be answered relatively easily: the world one flees is the world of people. The 'flee the people!' is the central determinant of apotaxis (Heussi 1936: 244ff). It also unmistakably characterizes the approach to the New Testament foundation documents, in which the call to leave the world is understood, for the sake of imitatio, as a call to detachment from all human bonds."

We can apply these considerations to the question of the system reference in which the argument is made. Apotaxis appears from the observer's perspective as flight from society, with which the observer assumes his world as the only real and relevant one; from the perspective of the observed system (if we consult its self-description), the anachoret, the monk, the religious conquers the actual world, and thus the inversion occurs: that the world-fugitive assumes the world-man to be world-fugitive, and that means: flight from God. Rituals of the complete renunciation of the world (Moorhouse 1969: 294) are then also, as one could show, rituals of the complete absorption into the real and actual, into the world actually intended by the metaphysical instance."

The ascetics, who as psychic systems keep the initial situation of religion virulent, so to speak, and continuously feed it into the communication of the community system, constantly living the relatedness to transcendence against fixed system structures, differentiate themselves against the community, also move locally to its periphery (Bergmann 1985: 33), and more or less loosely unite."

Ein kurzer Rückblick auf frühere Versuche zeigt die Notwendigkeit einer breiteren theoretischen Orientierung. Apotaxis (= Weltflucht) wird beschrieben als Effekt einer Paradoxie, die durch den Code des Religionssystemes (Immanenz/Transzendenz) entsteht. Die zentrale These ist, daß die religiöse Weltflucht der frühen Christenheit Systeme (Orden) produziert, die in der Kirche die Funktion des Latenzschutzes erfüllen können. Schweigen wird begriffen als Verstärkung von Apotaxis. Die Struktur des Kartäuserordens wird skizziert als Beispiel für ein System, dessen Funktion es ist, die Reinheit von Kirche und Orden trotz deren Weltlichkeit zu garantieren.\n"

We can apply these considerations to the question of the system reference in which the argument is made. Apotaxis appears from the observer's perspective as flight from society, with which the observer assumes his world as the only real and relevant one; from the perspective of the observed system (if we consult its self-description), the anachoret, the monk, the religious conquers the actual world, and thus the inversion occurs: that the world-fugitive assumes the world-man to be world-fugitive, and that means: flight from God. Rituals of the complete renunciation of the world (Moorhouse 1969: 294) are then also, as one could show, rituals of the complete absorption into the real and actual, into the world actually intended by the metaphysical instance."

The ascetics, who as psychic systems keep the initial situation of religion virulent, so to speak, and continuously feed it into the communication of the community system, constantly living the relatedness to transcendence against fixed system structures, differentiate themselves against the community, also move locally to its periphery (Bergmann 1985: 33), and more or less loosely unite."
