You can select files in finder and get it loaded in LB6, and you can operate on them. There is clipboard manager, that allows quick pasting as well. It also learns your shortcuts, so if you want to type browser and see firefox as first result, you can make it happen easily. [https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html site]"
