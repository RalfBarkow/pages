      "text": "Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and the College of William &amp; Mary have developed a tool to optimize supercomputing time. Their MemHC framework structures the memory of a graphics processing unit (GPU) to accelerate the calculation of many-body correlation functions. The researchers created three memory management methods that reduce redundant memory operations and expedite calculation of tensor contractions 10-fold. They coded MemHC to enable memories to persist on the GPU in a manner more appropriate for calculations, reducing the GPU's input and output tasks to concentrate on communication between the GPU and its host central processing unit."
