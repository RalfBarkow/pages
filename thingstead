In Marauders of Gor, we see an example of a Thing-fair which was the largest of the Things held, occurring Yearly around May, or Camerius by the reckoning of Ar.\n\nBased on Norse culture, there would have been other Things held locally or regionally at other times and more often.\n\nA thingstead is rarely considered holy ground, unless a sim has combined a permnent thingstead with a stone circle or other sacred space. Therefore, when a Thing is not being held, the thingstead may often be used as an arena or other gathering spot.",

It was held in the hands of the high rune-priest of the thing. Svein Blue Tooth grasped it in both hands. \"I swear upon you the peace of the thing,\" said he, \"and I make this oath of peace, for the time of the thing, mine own as well.\"\n\nQuote: In the crowd, too, much in evidence, were brazen bond-maids; they had been brought to the thing, generally, by captains and Jarls; it is not unusual for men to bring such slaves with them, though they are not permitted near the law courts or the assemblies of deliberation; the voyages to the thing were not, after all, ventures of raiding; they were not enterprises of warfare; there were three reasons for bringing such girls; they were for the pleasure of men; they served, as display objects, to indicate the wealth of their masters; and they could be bought and sold.
