This, as long as there is no logic that can digest paradoxes, is not objectionable. The shift of problems from logic to ideology is a possibility of deparadoxification of distinction, which has to be accepted, if the digestion system of logic itself cannot do this, but remains dependent on prior deparadoxification, for instance in the manner of [[Type Theory]]. It is only to be demanded that this procedure is practiced with more prudence and more transparency."
