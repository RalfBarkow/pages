      "text": "Learning Generosity is a disposition to facilitate, or support, a colleagues' professional curiosity and growth. It goes beyond saying ‘yes’ to a request for particular information, or to simply share something 'known'. To do this may massage the ego and can be satisfying in the short term. However, Learning Generosity requires going beyond, to become somewhat vulnerable, but in doing so more substantial breakthroughs can occur. Making a commitment  that doesn't have a defined outcome, or set timelines, presents uncertainty, something we generally don't like. Doing this, and especially for an 'outsider', has the potential for critique, evaluation and perhaps even judgement, so it can be safer to not take the risk."

It was a 'yes' to an email request to an organisation named Innovate Oregon because of a gap in a study tour itinerary during a planned few days in Portland. On a tour that took participants to some of the world's most innovative technology organisations and schools, the resulting short visit to Dayton Junior and High School turned out to be the most important of the tour."

It is not the Intellectual Property held by an individual or organisation, but what you are prepared to share, to give away.

These acts provide an opportunity to open windows to potential new wisdom, facilitate [[Colliding Ideas]] and build high levels of relational trust. "

Doing this takes courage, especially for 'outsiders', as it has the potential for critique, evaluation and perhaps even judgement. Likewise, a project that doesn't have a defined outcome, or set timelines, presents uncertainty, something we generally don't like."
