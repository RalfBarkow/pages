      "text": "Learning Generosity is the willingness to facilitate, or support, a colleagues' professional curiosity and growth. It can be easy to say ‘yes’ to a request for particular information, that requires a short time commitment, or to share an opinion. These things also massage the ego. However, it occasionally requires taking a risk, to be vulnerable, for more substantial breakthroughs to occur. Doing this takes courage, especially for 'outsiders', as it has the potential for critique, evaluation and perhaps even judgement. Likewise, a project that doesn't have a defined outcome, or set timelines, presents uncertainty, something we generally don't like."

It was a 'yes' to an email request to an organisation named Innovate Oregon because of a gap in a study tour itinerary during a planned few days in Portland. On a tour that took participants to some of the world's most innovative organisations and schools, the resulting short visit to Dayton Junior and High School turned out to be the most important of the tour."

It is not the Intellectual Property held by an individual or organisation, but what you are prepared to share, to give away.

These acts provide an opportunity to open windows to potential new wisdom, facilitate [[Colliding Ideas]] and build high levels of relational trust. "
