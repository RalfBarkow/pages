Adapting to these requires remembering some communication basics and implementing these in new and creative ways to create linkages and build networks. In the second of the two-part session offered through MEOPAR's 2021 Annual Training Meeting: Building Future Skills to Address Canada's Marine Challenges with Robyn Roscoe, you’ll:  \n- Define communication essentials and examine them for application in virtual settings.  \n- Implement new and apply existing tools to navigate relationships and collaborations.  \n- Create linkages and build purposeful networks through virtual and social media tools.   \n\n\n"
