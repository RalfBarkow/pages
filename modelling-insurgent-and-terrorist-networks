In the context of this paper, of course, we are using G as a mathematical model of the agents and communication links that make up a hypothetical TNet. Furthermore, we assume that this network is not isolated, either in space or in time, and that it exists within a more general environment ( ＝ EG), which surrounds, interpenetrates and interacts with G. (EG may consist, in part, of other, interrelated, networks). We assume that G performs some function (or, more generally, a set of functions), labelled, generically, by the symbol F. In SOTCAC, F includes the various recruiting, training, weapon acquisition, resource gathering and allocation and cell-coordination tasks needed for a TNet to attain a ‘mission ready’ state."

Implicit in G’s membership in VG is that some subset of VG best performs F, where ‘best’ is understood to be modulo some efficiency measure – labelled eG ＝ eG(EG,F) in Figure 1 – of how well a given graph performs F in the context of environment EG. For example, we expect a minimally efficient G to be one with very few (individually efficient) nodes and few links (or none at all). A highly efficient G might contain a moderate number of ‘just the right kinds of’ nodes with ‘just the right kind and numbers of’ links among them necessary to perform a given function. The fundamental problem, of course, is to make precise the otherwise vague phrase, ‘just the right kind of ...’"

Conceptually, at least, part of SOTCAC’s charter is to allow analysts to explore the veracity of alternative ‘feature sets’ and metrics that describe dynamic networks."

E 0 ¼ EG þ S. The presence and impact of S are modelled as a set of interventions (or actions), {ai}, that S implements on G.
