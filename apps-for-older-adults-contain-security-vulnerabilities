      "text": "Researchers at Canada's Concordia University found security bugs in 95 of 146 popular Android applications designed for older adults. The researchers discovered that many apps failed to properly authenticate server application programming interface endpoints, which attackers could exploit to access sensitive personal data. Other apps had easily penetrable accounts, with some sending unencrypted information to either client-side servers or third-party domains. The researchers found multiple other flaws in dozens of other apps. Only seven of the 35 app developers the team contacted about the bugs responded, while Concordia's Pranay Kapoor said the vulnerabilities could be remedied by following best practices for basic security."
