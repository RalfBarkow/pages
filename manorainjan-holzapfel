A hard ban is a severe form of punishment, which typically means that the user is permanently banned from the site and cannot return under any circumstances. In this case, it seems that the user's actions were in violation of community guidelines and they were not willing to comply with requests to stop. The ban was sustained due to persistent behavior. It is important to follow community guidelines when participating in a collaborative website like a wiki, as it helps to maintain a positive and productive environment for all users."
