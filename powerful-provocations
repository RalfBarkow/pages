It is said that undesirable behaviours can be prevented by deeper levels of engagement, that learner participation and cooperation with educators and co-learners is enhanced and that, most importantly, students are more motivated and likely to learn new skills and understandings when engaged. The ways in which we authentically ‘hook’ learners into learning new content and exploring it more deeply is therefore a critical consideration. "

In order to ‘powerfully provoke’, teachers must firstly have a deep understanding of content, understandings and skills. They can then contemplate how they might pique the curiosity of their learners, sparking questions, igniting investigations and illuminating inquiry pathways. "

We began exploring how curating intriguing investigations could help our learners be authentic mathematics users. From here, planning provocations flowed into other learning areas and began to have real influence on our Tuning In pedagogy. Utilising provocations is not only giving us a greater insight into learner interest and voice, but it is also revealing learner prior knowledge at deeper levels. "
