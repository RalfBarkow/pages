(For some reason, I was always the one that wrote that document.) This document then served as a contract between them and me: they knew what they had to build and I knew what I could build upon. And about a year later, we would be both ready: they had built their machine and I had all the basic software finished. (Not tested, of course, but that turned always out to be superfluous. At the time I did not realize how valuable this training was of programming for a machine that did not exist yet; now I know.) -- [https://web.archive.org/web/20061214070511/http://www.cs.utexas.edu:80/users/almstrum/cs373/general/EWD1166.html archive]"
