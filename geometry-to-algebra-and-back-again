      "text": "and we'll start with geometry which is in my opinion the basis for everything else we have Okay so from this little guy here uh upper right quadrant for you uh we have a half billion year old bug likee Cambrian swimmer and then we have bug eating early mammals and then we have a buge eating prian I mean giving our family tree it's no surprise that our software is full of bugs but we have something else in common which is that we all Survive by moving through 3D space and to move through space you need to be able to plan based on what you're sensing which requires you to emulate the world to make predictions about future States so this is Simone biles one of the greatest gymnasts ever to compete she's showing truly Elite human spatial and thus geometric ability and my contention is that everything we do in technical mathematics the kind we use in engineering and most physics comes from the same evolved capacities allow her to plan and execute that elaborate series of translations and rotations and our ability to turn those physical gifts inward is what has given us sculpture and perspective drawing as well as mathematical geometry and our ability to reason about objects in space LED naturally to our number sense now many animals have been shown to count objects and work with sequences and there seems to be a natural development of pattern matching and interacting with objects in the world most of you know that pigeons and rats can learn to press a lever a certain number of times to get a treat what you might be more surprised to learn is that red Forest ants can count to around 20 and communicate those quantities to other ants and some animals can apply short-term memory to sequences better than most humans this chimp is memorizing these numerical sequences and tapping them out after they're uded this is something at which the average chimp outperforms the average human this brings us to algebra so while numb exists in some extent to in most animals in geometric sense probably exists in all complex life forms algebra is more specifically human it has biological roots in language and deliberation so this is the first paper I'll recommend today even though it has nothing to do with computer science or mathematics it's an especially good followup to the research on bias that you might have seen from kotan and tki and things like thinking fast and slow their claim and I I think they're right is that as a group living species our reason abilities Rose in the context of deliberation which gave rise to persuasion and the skeptical evaluation of claims and this arms race between these facilities reified cause and effect reasoning into a conscious reflective and linguistic process formal logic and symbolic fluencies seem to be Downstream of this and once we translated the ability to communicate via streams of words and symbols that is to say into art and writing we were able to develop notation at which point we move from biology to culture in our story here today and one of the most successful cultural artifacts of all time is math notation so we might ask what's it for it's both for communication and for thinking you know the Simplicity and Clarity of a good notation not only allows us to serialize our understanding and transmit it to other human beings it also becomes an engine for our own thinking in the context of physics and Engineering we really want that notation to speak as directly as possible to our inner gymnast so that we can bring our deepest evolved powers to bear on whatever problem we're solving as Bertrand Russell puts it here a good notation can be a teacher unto itself you bounce your ideas off of formalism that guide you to a deeper understanding that said if he were alive today I think he'd go further in Champion Machine readable notation that is to say programming language anybody here who has both worked with an Al through an algebraic problem on paper and also used an interactive programming system like for example Mathematica will be able to attest the power of the ladder for improving understanding so I'm going to look at mathematics uh mathematical dotation through a programming language lens throughout the day and this is an eccentric way of doing this and I'm going to anachronistically project back ideas that didn't exist at the Times these things were invented uh and I I'm doing this both because this is a an audience of mostly programmers with varying levels of mathematical ability but also so because I think we do need to apply what we've learned from programming languages in the 20th century so this notation is really it's it's one of our best tools for thought and I don't have time to make the full argument for this and for the need to move to machine readable uh notations here today but I will recommend strongly this paper by susman and wisdom which discusses the work they did creating a scheme based curriculum for classical mechanics if You' prefer it in talk Mo uh talk form check out susman's programming for the expression of ideas and Sam Richie talks about Emy a closure report of susman system which I I hope you all saw at his talk earlier today at this conference so what do we really want for this kind of notation well we want a small number of orthal Primitives it's going to be purely functional because mathematics is it'll have recursive definitions and it'll be lightly objectoriented and I mean that in the sense that it will have generic dispatch of some set of operations over a family of mathematical objects so let's build a protocol for arithmetic in the same order our cultural ancestors did starting with the natural numbers the non- negative integers now I say non- negative but a fun fact about the natural numbers that there's still to this day no agreement as to whether they include zero these are the numbers we use in informal or folk mathematics the ones we share with those Forest ANS we saw earlier they're very tangible and intuitive you can do the first three operations on this slide with any kind of object in the in the natural world division is a bit weird right you either have to accept that the operation returns a tuple of quotient and remainder which initially feels like a type error or you need to invent fractions at which point you have rational numbers but only the positive ones so this would be whole numbers and vulgar fractions right now these are usually uh presented after the integers for set theoretical reasons but we're working today in the order in which these are normally discovered rather than the order in which they're taught so then we have a protocol that looks like this right we've got these four operations we've got these types now the first people we see using this protocol are in ancient Mesopotamia these objects you see here are almost 6,000 years old the thing on the top is called a bulla which is a kind of spherical clay envelope and the smaller things below are stylized representations of trade goods let's say the middle row are Quant tokens yeah so I might put three of them in a bullet and then seal it with a amazing cryptographically secure cylinder seal of people walking to the left as you see here and then later you could drop by my bakery and collect your pastries so this is tangible Computing in an extreme sense right so over time they switched using tokens to make impressions in clay tablets so you could just push the goat token down five times and say well that's five goats and then they move to drawing you know directly on the clay and making tally marks which gets a little better better fun things to note about this piece of History sculpture preceded writing our first forms of writing were about numbers and accounting and credit long precede the invention of money anyway these were very intelligent people so they quickly invented a more abstract numerical notation that looked like this now it's base 60 unlike our base 10 numbers but they had a true place value system like we do not like Roman numerals and 60 is actually a boss way to do this because it has all these factors so if you're living in a world where you're doing everything with fractions as they were it's amazing to be able to factor all of your numbers they even did their uh their division by multiplication of fractions so instead of dividing something by two they would multiply it by 1/2 or as as we put it these days multiplication by reciprocals and to make that fast they had big pre-computed tablets of reciprocals squares cubes uh roots and everything else which we see Engineers doing in our culture as late as the 20th century right up until there were computers so you might ask what did they get up to with all these numbers so I call this tablet a paper I love but it's actually a 4,000 year old old homework assignment right so what's this person doing this young scribe they're solving a problem of area using using Pythagoras Theorem which you'll note is named after someone born 1500 years later and the uniform writing in the middle shows the square root of two to six decimal places they were iteratively approximating irrational numbers in Babylon which is why God struck them down actually so so what were they doing like they developed these tools for surveying initially because they were calculating the areas of parcels and fields which as as an agrarian people you'd expect and they were doing a lot of astronomy because they had a moon-based calendar the way everybody does a lunar calendar and they needed to square it with the solar on so they knew when to plant for the seasons and all that but they went way past what was reasonable for this purpose everything was Surplus to requirements it's pretty clear to me reading these old tablets that the scribal class was composed of the same kind of curious weirdos who invent everything everywhere in every culture they solved quadratic and cubic equations they worked worked with exponential growth and interest rates they even came up with a fourar analysis to compute the ephemeris so they could pick out where the plans would be in the future this is approximately on par with European mathematics 3500 years later so you might wonder why weren't we on the Moon by like a thousand BCE right you know they were prosperous and they were so close to inventing modern technical mathematics to put in perspective we're only about 600 years after European mathematics reached the same point and the answer as it so often is yeah so their agric cultural technology that allowed them to feed their big cities and develop their sophisticated culture was unsustainable the soil grew depleted and salty over time reducing crop yields and then there was an interval of rapid and severe climate change that led to famine and War any resemblance to the current ERA is I'm sure entirely coincidental and no cause for alarm anyway after around 1550 BC there's a dramatic fallof of mathematical tablets all you get are things like this King telling that King that he's going to go kill him if he doesn't give him enough whatever and we don't see very much mathematical progress for about a thousand years this was a long period of relative stagnation The Good the highlights I can give is the Greeks invented basic formal proofs around 600 BC and a couple of people came up with good ways to approximate the area under a curve but otherwise not much was happening and one of the reasons for all of this stagnation was that the Greeks really hated irrational mbers although Babylonians and Egyptians were okay with approximating the square root of two the Greeks thought that they were an Abomination if contemporary counsel to be believed people were murdered in ancient Greece for talking about these numbers which violated closely held philosophical ideas ultimately they wanted Mass to be like the counting with tokens thing that we saw earlier which I contend held them back for quite some time so for the next thousand or so years after that various cultures took turns shepherding the torch of the surviving wisdom of the Ancients the Greeks the Persians Indian mathematicians the House of Wisdom in Baghdad Brahma Gupta and Alaris or as important to what we have today as Dart and gaus but in the interest of time we're just going to skip forward to Italy in the 1800s so by that time our protocol has grown to include a few more types right we have most of the numeric types that we recognize but we still have the same four basic methods over it and uh some of these numbers are a bit weird like the irrationals are odd but if you squinted them long enough you can kind of pretend they're at least the same kind of thing as the natural numbers because we're interested in Geometry let's just take a quick look at these numbers through a spatial or a geometric lens right so spatially this number line is a bit strange right we don't we're not taught that it's weird but it is weird because we have an infinite line but somehow it also has an end at zero and it's a singularity beneath which subtraction fails so you know to to really get somewhere you need negative numbers and as you might imagine people hated negative numbers too they really despise them uh and this is mainly because it's not intuitively obvious that you can have minus three goats right it just doesn't make sense so diantus said any negative solution to equation was automatically false livets hated them and they didn't start to be widely used until the mid 19th century which is kind of crazy from our modern perspective now I think they're actually more radical than the irrationals because they changed the spatial interpretation of the number line in a very important way so we now have the origin in the middle of the line and an infinite extent to either side it's symmetrical so we can think of addition and subtraction as translation in a point in this Infinite Space and more interestingly we can interpret the sign flip we get with multiplication by minus one is a rotation around the origin by 180 deges some of the mathematicians here are saying could also be a reflection and that's true but today we're going to pretend it's only a rotation so by so by adding a new kind of number we get a new kind of space actually that allows both translation and a limited form of rotation and the next big discovery which many of you have already guessed was complex numbers so in the 1500s rapael bombelli was trying to deal with an equation of this form and the solution that he had gotten from cardano for this kind of thing was this this algorithm that you see here in both maths code and also closure code and you can see see the problem right away there's a boundary condition where P cubed is greater than Q ^2 after which one needs to take the square root of a negative number and it returns none right so it's no good but bombelli grafted the two components that he was trying to compare here and Visually confirmed that they converge and he was primarily an engineer so he did what any engineer would do he cluded it yeah so he used a placeholder and this placeholder had a special behavior in these situations and he got this from cardano who had invented it but said it was completely useless and he then wrote a book bom belly then wrote a book about how to solve these problems right and and the textual description you see here is from that book except the part with i in it was actually retrofitted in the addition that I screencapped and although I've read these books I'm not recommending any from this period because they predate anything like modern notation and the Expedition all looks like this walls of text with funny drawings but his method worked which did not stop as you can imagine everyone from sincerely hating it and one of the reasons they hated it which is hinted at at the bottom there is it seemed to violate the rules of of mult application it just didn't make sense and it also looks arbitrary and magical because they were still under the influence of the Greeks in their perspective on numbers now all of you already know that I stands for imagin Imaginary but to get a sense of the vibe Dart coined the term imaginary number as an insult to the very idea that such a thing could exist right this is how people felt about these numbers but over the next 250 years because they simplified calculations involving trig they gained ground and by the early 1800s argand and gaus and vessel all independently figured out that their special geometric numbers that encode rotations in a 2d plane which In fairness was a concept that did not exist in bomb Bell's time so we can forgive him for not noticing uh some find this easier uh easier to see if they look at it like this right this illustration shows that with each exponentiation I rotates by 90 degrees and notice how this feels kind of relative to what we saw earlier with the number line where sign flips sign flips cause rotations now that we have two we're kind of able to cut that in half and there's more going on that I can't explain to a general audience in the time I have but in my opinion the move to complex numbers was the biggest jump in in the history of math up to that point to having real geometric objects things that can represent the kind of world that we perceive and uh another important fact about this is that once you get to them you can't really keep pretending that these are numbers in the same sense as you know the number of goats we're we're somewhere else now we have escaped the naturalistic idea of numbers altogether and I think this is inevitable I think without it the gymnast part of our brains would never have a chance so we're caught up to mid 1800s they were what you might call electrifying times right so the study of what we now call electromagnetism was heating up and Commercial applications were becoming very important the internet boom of the time was the telegraph right it came into commercial use by 1840 submarine cables were laid by 1850 how's that for Progress how's that for building right so this allowed rapid communication between continents for the first time to give you some sense of what that meant it used to take two and a half months for a piece of mail to get from London to Sydney this chart shows you various ones but we're not going to linger on it because it's not the main point of this so this period is where electrical engineering began it was in the context of a different kind of information technology the information of telegraphy right and our computers descend directly from the Telegraph and telephone Claud Shannon's Master thesis which is written only about 80 years later laid the blueprint for our digital computers by applying Boolean algebra to analog relays in the telephone system and the people who were working on this stuff at the time were sort of Matha physicists right because they they hadn't divided into two disciplines at this stage all mathematicians were physicist and vice versa at least close to that and the big problem they faced was coming up with a system for calcul involving 3D space including rotations this was especially important for representing the ideas contained in Maxwell's equations which we will look at now so this block that you see on the left there that's what Maxwell actually wrote down and it's a lot you know there's a lot of stuff there and the stuff on the right which is much more concise and actually much more clear if you happen to have learned how to read this particular notation was created by uh somebody called Gibbs and another person called heavyside one of them in the US one of them UK and it's the system that's taught today and even if you can't read it you can recognize how much more concise it is and that it contains basically the same mathematical information means we're winning right we're we're able to communicate more in less space but the notational system that I prefer and that I'm kind of hinting at today captures the same relationship like this so this this is actually even more tur but it does contain all of the relevant information I cannot explain how in the time I have today but but I will link to an explanation with all the details and for this audience I want to instead give a very gental introduction to this notation which is called geometric algebra we're going to start with these Two Fellas so the black and white one is grasson and the other is Clifford grasson was a German High School teacher who invented most of vectric algebra as a side quest while studying title theory in his fair time this guy was a genius unfortunately his writing was as muddy as his ideas were brilliant so his work made almost no impact during his lifetime Clifford was an English mathematician born somewhat later and also an astronomer and he was one of the few to read and understand grassman's work which he combined with Hamilton's querian and he created this system that he called geometric algebra but that many modern speakers call Clifford algebra in his honored unfortunately he died of tuberculosis at 33 so I suspect we'd have standardized on his approach if he'd lived long enough to make the case for it over the following decades and the uh to talk about this system We'll add a couple more objects and operations to our protocol call so now we have something like this right multiplication has trifurcated we have three kinds of multiplication so the dot product the wed wedge product and the geometric product and then we have vectors which I'm calling here K vectors for reasons that we will loop back around to in a couple of minutes so what do we talk about when we talk about vectors they're geometric objects they're not numbers like they're definitely not numbers but they represent a combination of a length and a direction and we'll often call the length a magnitude which is fancy Latin for bigness and we're going to cover this idea in 2D because that's easier so we're gonna start with this right so here you see these two orthogonal basis vectors so here we have two arrows one who's positive extent extends to the right called E1 and one that extends upward called E2 they're both of unit length which is to say of magnitude one note that the written as E1 and E2 not as X and Y well that's because we as programmers when we see ourselves giving individual names to ordered sequences of similar things we start to think maybe there should be an array with indices or something and in that Spirit we're using these numbered terms so you can add them together like this right uh and you can add them adding them together along with some scalar multiple of each allows you to create any Arrow of any length pointing in any angle right it's just linear combinations of these basis vectors and you can also subtract them and subtraction flips the sign of the subtracted one and this is actually very similar to what we saw earlier with the positive and negative number line right you change the direction of the thing you learned all this this is all the same as what you learned in vector algebra at school the dot product also pretty much the same as what you learned at school so so this is a thing that measures the the co extent of these two lines through a through distance and if you use unit vectors that if you normalize to a length of one of the two you get the cosine back out and then we have this guy which is the wedge product right so this guy is for those of you with a lot of linear algebra it's a generalization of another product that you've already seen called the cross product and what this guy does is he returns instead of like the cross product returns a vector this guy returns a b Vector so the bi Vector is this thing you see on the right hand side here which if a vector is a line that goes in a direction for some distance this is an oriented area so it's just a higher Dimension analog to a vector and you can see that one Arrow points to the tail of the other arrow and then there's a circle in the middle the circle represents the direction that you would rotate in order to bring the head of the second arrow to the tail of the ladder right and we use the reason I like these so much compared to other formulations is that if you Ed by vectors to provide uh your representation of torque and angular momentum in the magnetic field your computations are actually much more concise and make more geometric sense which we'll cover more in just a second and then the most important one of these new kinds of multiplication is something called the geometric product which as you see here is just taking the dot product and adding it to the wedge product now that's kind of weird right because one of them is returning a scalar and the other one's returning this funny bi Vector thing but we've actually seen this exact same relationship a few minutes ago and that's in the complex numbers so so it it turns out that the imaginary number I was actually just the unit by Vector all along and what was once kind of an algebraic ghost turns out to be a consequence of the geometry of space now this is another one where I'll have to link to the supporting materials but man the algebraic expansion that proves this is extremely beautiful now I'm going to compare this approach to the approach that we mostly use like if you go and take Vector there are a lot of matricies involved and to me the Matrix approach kind of treats vectors as tuples with Benefits right it's still it's a series of numbers and you have to pick the numbers apart and then you put them into these matrices and then you grind the crank on the side and you get you get the answer but the geometric intuition that you get from doing that is usually pretty poor and it takes a lot of time and work to get students to understand what these matrices mean in contrast using geometric algebra you can if you need a specific rotation uh by an angle here you do something looks exactly like what you would do with a complex number and you can also just rotate by another bi Vector so simple multiplication you can say hey I've got a line that points this way and I want to take the product of this line and that line and you'll get a rotation which is kind of amazing uh as we will see later this this makes a lot of things way easier so moving on from there I will recommend this paper because it can give you the rigorous treatment that you are craving right now that I cannot provide in this short talk so this is called imaginary numbers are not real it's by Gull lenb and Duran these are three physicists who've done loads of work over the last 20 years to popularize GA in their writing it it's everything is very accessible and if you have high school level maths you can you can plow through it so we've been talking about this all in 2D which has has this particular uh set of entities but one of the great strengths about this approach is that as you go up in Dimensions you keep exactly the same operations and you have sort of equivalent objects so we're going to just take a quick look at what the 3D case might look like which is this so we talked about how a bi Vector is what happens when you wedge together two vectors right then you get this area but if you wedge together three of those you get an oriented volume so all the same operations work the same way in three dimensions as they worked in two Dimensions you don't have a lot of new stuff to learn and this is very different from how we normally teach this stuff normally as you go to three dimensions you learn two or three different uh pieces of the toolkit that only ever work in three dimensions like the cross product but here you just keep doing things the same way you were doing them and it continues to work as you go up and this is why we call them K vectors because really what you have is not a vector a bi Vector Tri Vector what you have is a one vector two Vector three Vector four Vector however many Vector that you need and this turns out to be super useful in physics in fact variations on geometric algebra have been reinvented repeatedly over history because the original notation we had was insufficient so p and der algebras are just geometric algebras invented by physicists to solve physical problems without even knowing that Clifford's results had existed and all of this this huge zoo of geometric Concepts that we use in technical mathematics are all representable inside geometric algebra so instead of having to learn like you know 10 different things to do your your basic engineering or physics work you learn one thing and you keep using it so what we can say about geometric algebra is it kind of combines align areas and volumes now there are other things we care about in Geometry that are not there as you can imagine right there are no planes uh for example there are no spheres things like that so there have to be extensions and uh being able to operate in however many dimensions you please is great but you kind of need to add one more thing to get the full magic of the system and unfortunately it is the most subtle and hard to explain thing here so we're going to get extra extra handwavy now so that's metrics right so so this is in our programming language metaphor these are this is a bit like metaprogramming where you say I want an algebra and I want this many dimensions of the AL algebra to square to minus one like B vectors do but I also want some that's squared to either one or zero the more mathematically sophisticated among you be saying oh yeah so if you need a hyperbolic space you could have this and so on and that's exactly it you can you can then represent more different kinds of spaces this way and once you do that you can Source a up a vast variety of the tools that we use for technical mathematics as these little metric versions of geometric algebra so here are some examples now this is not in any sense a complete list but these are some very popular tools that you can get in this way uh and I'll I'll shout out a couple in particular right so the um macowski SpaceTime is super cool for doing physics and a lot of people are using it for that purpose and if you look at the conformal geometric algebra the last one on the list this one is neat because it has his basic objects things like spheres and so if you want a circle you look at the intersection of two spheres and the part where they meet is a circle and there are situations where that is pretty great but for me the one that is most interesting uh for the things I do day in and day out is projective geometric algebra which I use a lot for computer Graphics applications and for that I'm going to recommend this paper and I'll say that that this line of research really kicked off in 2000 in the context of Robotics when people were looking for better ways to uh to handle the geometry of the world inside of a a situated agent and there was a fellow called zelig who wrote a really nice paper I will link to it and that was followed up by theoretical work by a fellow called Charles Gun uh but because of the background of this audience I think the best paper for you if you're interested in this part is this one by dor and deenik uh and these same people have many Fantastic video presentations on YouTube you can find great stuff about this that will go in depth and Deen in particular is a tireless Advocate who has built a fantastic JavaScript playground for this stuff called ganja uh but in the meantime time we're going to do a little bit of ill-advised live coding right [Applause] so okay so we have our friend emac here and we have a little box you'll notice it's closure code sorry for the non list people there's a JavaScript version of this I I will link to as well which you know if you need infix it has it for you uh so so this is one of those metric things where I'm I'm declaring this uh this certain algebra of these dimensions and and this metric and I'm not going to explain what that means at the moment these are kind of throwaway things that are building that box by knowing how to make uh vertices and edges you got some starter state for a couple of things and then this this function here is uh the entire physics engine and and I want to make clear that what I'm about to show you there's nothing underneath right this is just uh this is just a mathematics library that I'm using to do this so I'm going to come down here and I'm going to uncomment this line and and our little friend the Box will start to bounce around as soon as I can get my mouse over there all right right so the reason we can do this with only like three lines of code to account for Gravity hooks law and a damping function is because the entities that we're using in this context know about both direction and rotation and magnitude all at the same time so this is actually pretty cool now those of you who do a lot of physics or Graphics programming probably think well you know 2D it's not that big a deal right I mean so what happens if we change this to a three and we come over here and we do it again oh it's it's a cube now so you'll note a couple of things here I didn't change a single line of code other than the dimensionality that's pretty boss actually normally you'd have to do a bunch of stuff like if you're a graphics programmer you can clap it's okay now I'm going to change but you know what if we wanted four dimensions how about a tesseract on a string right like that's pretty [Applause] cool so I I'll post later I'll post a blog post or something where I go into line by line what's happening here but it it is pretty amazing and the code because it's in this nice lispy language is basically onetoone with the mathematics that we would otherwise use so uh oh I can't get back to my notes I'm trapped in live coding forever let's see which I guess isn't the worst thing that could happen there we go all right so all right so hopefully this tiny taste has been enough to attract your interest we're pretty much out of time but before you go I need to mention David Hennis that's this joyful looking man here in the 1960s he started work on a research program aimed at refactoring the notation used for technical mathematics using geometric algebra and my first exposure to these ideas was in an 80s paper of his that used geometric algebra to explore theong as a lens on understanding direct theory of electrons it was mind-blowing it blew my mind and after after spending some time with it I came to agree with this quote from David Estus right so this is a way that we we can just move everything into a single formalism and simplify everything that we're doing this is a chance we have to refactor things in a way that could reduce by maybe two or three years the time it takes to educate a young physicist and in so doing make more advanced topics accessible to many more people this would I believe result in real progress in The Sciences which is why I care enough to bring this to your attention today and if this talk inspires you to read only one paper I would ask you to read David EST Stan's 2002 or metal lecture in which he makes this case very very well and I'll close with this quote from hen's old Professor Richard fan and a few thank yous uh first I'd like to thank Alex Miller for his tireless efforts organizing one of the best technology conferences in the world for all these years can we yeah and I'd like to thank the organizers of papers we love Zan shout out for for inviting me I'd like to thank my friend heish Todd for telling me over lunch in Berlin a few years ago that an active Community had formed around geometric algebra thus renewing my hopes for the future I'd like to give thanks to my colleagues at next journal for tolerating my eent excentricities and supporting my work including the creation of this talk and lastly and of course thanks to all of you for [Applause] listening"

        "text": "so this is going to be an unusual papers we love talk I'm going to discuss a bunch of different papers in relatively light detail but with Rich historical context I will post a transcript and mini site for this talk with links to all the papers and many others that serve as supporting material so last year I gave a talk of strange Loop where I said everyone is programming wrong this this upset some people and I thought I'd make a more modest claim today everyone is doing mathematics wrong so so we'll need some background to make sense of what follows and I'm going to start with a very easy question what is mathematics and where does it come from famously no one has ever struggled with this one so there are many lenses for this question I'm going to supply one to serve for the duration of this talk I I think we both discover and invent mathematics as we go and the part of what we discover is the nature of our own evolved capabilities and we'll start with geometry which is in my opinion the basis for everything else we have Okay so from this little guy here uh upper right quadrant for you uh we have a half billion year old bug likee Cambrian swimmer and then we have bug eating early mammals and then we have a buge eating prian I mean giving our family tree it's no surprise that our software is full of bugs but we have something else in common which is that we all Survive by moving through 3D space and to move through space you need to be able to plan based on what you're sensing which requires you to emulate the world to make predictions about future States so this is Simone biles one of the greatest gymnasts ever to compete she's showing truly Elite human spatial and thus geometric ability and my contention is that everything we do in technical mathematics the kind we use in engineering and most physics comes from the same evolved capacities allow her to plan and execute that elaborate series of translations and rotations and our ability to turn those physical gifts inward is what has given us sculpture and perspective drawing as well as mathematical geometry and our ability to reason about objects in space LED naturally to our number sense now many animals have been shown to count objects and work with sequences and there seems to be a natural development of pattern matching and interacting with objects in the world most of you know that pigeons and rats can learn to press a lever a certain number of times to get a treat what you might be more surprised to learn is that red Forest ants can count to around 20 and communicate those quantities to other ants and some animals can apply short-term memory to sequences better than most humans this chimp is memorizing these numerical sequences and tapping them out after they're uded this is something at which the average chimp outperforms the average human this brings us to algebra so while numb exists in some extent to in most animals in geometric sense probably exists in all complex life forms algebra is more specifically human it has biological roots in language and deliberation so this is the first paper I'll recommend today even though it has nothing to do with computer science or mathematics it's an especially good followup to the research on bias that you might have seen from kotan and tki and things like thinking fast and slow their claim and I I think they're right is that as a group living species our reason abilities Rose in the context of deliberation which gave rise to persuasion and the skeptical evaluation of claims and this arms race between these facilities reified cause and effect reasoning into a conscious reflective and linguistic process formal logic and symbolic fluencies seem to be Downstream of this and once we translated the ability to communicate via streams of words and symbols that is to say into art and writing we were able to develop notation at which point we move from biology to culture in our story here today and one of the most successful cultural artifacts of all time is math notation so we might ask what's it for it's both for communication and for thinking you know the Simplicity and Clarity of a good notation not only allows us to serialize our understanding and transmit it to other human beings it also becomes an engine for our own thinking in the context of physics and Engineering we really want that notation to speak as directly as possible to our inner gymnast so that we can bring our deepest evolved powers to bear on whatever problem we're solving as Bertrand Russell puts it here a good notation can be a teacher unto itself you bounce your ideas off of formalism that guide you to a deeper understanding that said if he were alive today I think he'd go further in Champion Machine readable notation that is to say programming language anybody here who has both worked with an Al through an algebraic problem on paper and also used an interactive programming system like for example Mathematica will be able to attest the power of the ladder for improving understanding so I'm going to look at mathematics uh mathematical dotation through a programming language lens throughout the day and this is an eccentric way of doing this and I'm going to anachronistically project back ideas that didn't exist at the Times these things were invented uh and I I'm doing this both because this is a an audience of mostly programmers with varying levels of mathematical ability but also so because I think we do need to apply what we've learned from programming languages in the 20th century so this notation is really it's it's one of our best tools for thought and I don't have time to make the full argument for this and for the need to move to machine readable uh notations here today but I will recommend strongly this paper by susman and wisdom which discusses the work they did creating a scheme based curriculum for classical mechanics if You' prefer it in talk Mo uh talk form check out susman's programming for the expression of ideas and Sam Richie talks about Emy a closure report of susman system which I I hope you all saw at his talk earlier today at this conference so what do we really want for this kind of notation well we want a small number of orthal Primitives it's going to be purely functional because mathematics is it'll have recursive definitions and it'll be lightly objectoriented and I mean that in the sense that it will have generic dispatch of some set of operations over a family of mathematical objects so let's build a protocol for arithmetic in the same order our cultural ancestors did starting with the natural numbers the non- negative integers now I say non- negative but a fun fact about the natural numbers that there's still to this day no agreement as to whether they include zero these are the numbers we use in informal or folk mathematics the ones we share with those Forest ANS we saw earlier they're very tangible and intuitive you can do the first three operations on this slide with any kind of object in the in the natural world division is a bit weird right you either have to accept that the operation returns a tuple of quotient and remainder which initially feels like a type error or you need to invent fractions at which point you have rational numbers but only the positive ones so this would be whole numbers and vulgar fractions right now these are usually uh presented after the integers for set theoretical reasons but we're working today in the order in which these are normally discovered rather than the order in which they're taught so then we have a protocol that looks like this right we've got these four operations we've got these types now the first people we see using this protocol are in ancient Mesopotamia these objects you see here are almost 6,000 years old the thing on the top is called a bulla which is a kind of spherical clay envelope and the smaller things below are stylized representations of trade goods let's say the middle row are Quant tokens yeah so I might put three of them in a bullet and then seal it with a amazing cryptographically secure cylinder seal of people walking to the left as you see here and then later you could drop by my bakery and collect your pastries so this is tangible Computing in an extreme sense right so over time they switched using tokens to make impressions in clay tablets so you could just push the goat token down five times and say well that's five goats and then they move to drawing you know directly on the clay and making tally marks which gets a little better better fun things to note about this piece of History sculpture preceded writing our first forms of writing were about numbers and accounting and credit long precede the invention of money anyway these were very intelligent people so they quickly invented a more abstract numerical notation that looked like this now it's base 60 unlike our base 10 numbers but they had a true place value system like we do not like Roman numerals and 60 is actually a boss way to do this because it has all these factors so if you're living in a world where you're doing everything with fractions as they were it's amazing to be able to factor all of your numbers they even did their uh their division by multiplication of fractions so instead of dividing something by two they would multiply it by 1/2 or as as we put it these days multiplication by reciprocals and to make that fast they had big pre-computed tablets of reciprocals squares cubes uh roots and everything else which we see Engineers doing in our culture as late as the 20th century right up until there were computers so you might ask what did they get up to with all these numbers so I call this tablet a paper I love but it's actually a 4,000 year old old homework assignment right so what's this person doing this young scribe they're solving a problem of area using using Pythagoras Theorem which you'll note is named after someone born 1500 years later and the uniform writing in the middle shows the square root of two to six decimal places they were iteratively approximating irrational numbers in Babylon which is why God struck them down actually so so what were they doing like they developed these tools for surveying initially because they were calculating the areas of parcels and fields which as as an agrarian people you'd expect and they were doing a lot of astronomy because they had a moon-based calendar the way everybody does a lunar calendar and they needed to square it with the solar on so they knew when to plant for the seasons and all that but they went way past what was reasonable for this purpose everything was Surplus to requirements it's pretty clear to me reading these old tablets that the scribal class was composed of the same kind of curious weirdos who invent everything everywhere in every culture they solved quadratic and cubic equations they worked worked with exponential growth and interest rates they even came up with a fourar analysis to compute the ephemeris so they could pick out where the plans would be in the future this is approximately on par with European mathematics 3500 years later so you might wonder why weren't we on the Moon by like a thousand BCE right you know they were prosperous and they were so close to inventing modern technical mathematics to put in perspective we're only about 600 years after European mathematics reached the same point and the answer as it so often is yeah so their agric cultural technology that allowed them to feed their big cities and develop their sophisticated culture was unsustainable the soil grew depleted and salty over time reducing crop yields and then there was an interval of rapid and severe climate change that led to famine and War any resemblance to the current ERA is I'm sure entirely coincidental and no cause for alarm anyway after around 1550 BC there's a dramatic fallof of mathematical tablets all you get are things like this King telling that King that he's going to go kill him if he doesn't give him enough whatever and we don't see very much mathematical progress for about a thousand years this was a long period of relative stagnation The Good the highlights I can give is the Greeks invented basic formal proofs around 600 BC and a couple of people came up with good ways to approximate the area under a curve but otherwise not much was happening and one of the reasons for all of this stagnation was that the Greeks really hated irrational mbers although Babylonians and Egyptians were okay with approximating the square root of two the Greeks thought that they were an Abomination if contemporary counsel to be believed people were murdered in ancient Greece for talking about these numbers which violated closely held philosophical ideas ultimately they wanted Mass to be like the counting with tokens thing that we saw earlier which I contend held them back for quite some time so for the next thousand or so years after that various cultures took turns shepherding the torch of the surviving wisdom of the Ancients the Greeks the Persians Indian mathematicians the House of Wisdom in Baghdad Brahma Gupta and Alaris or as important to what we have today as Dart and gaus but in the interest of time we're just going to skip forward to Italy in the 1800s so by that time our protocol has grown to include a few more types right we have most of the numeric types that we recognize but we still have the same four basic methods over it and uh some of these numbers are a bit weird like the irrationals are odd but if you squinted them long enough you can kind of pretend they're at least the same kind of thing as the natural numbers because we're interested in Geometry let's just take a quick look at these numbers through a spatial or a geometric lens right so spatially this number line is a bit strange right we don't we're not taught that it's weird but it is weird because we have an infinite line but somehow it also has an end at zero and it's a singularity beneath which subtraction fails so you know to to really get somewhere you need negative numbers and as you might imagine people hated negative numbers too they really despise them uh and this is mainly because it's not intuitively obvious that you can have minus three goats right it just doesn't make sense so diantus said any negative solution to equation was automatically false livets hated them and they didn't start to be widely used until the mid 19th century which is kind of crazy from our modern perspective now I think they're actually more radical than the irrationals because they changed the spatial interpretation of the number line in a very important way so we now have the origin in the middle of the line and an infinite extent to either side it's symmetrical so we can think of addition and subtraction as translation in a point in this Infinite Space and more interestingly we can interpret the sign flip we get with multiplication by minus one is a rotation around the origin by 180 deges some of the mathematicians here are saying could also be a reflection and that's true but today we're going to pretend it's only a rotation so by so by adding a new kind of number we get a new kind of space actually that allows both translation and a limited form of rotation and the next big discovery which many of you have already guessed was complex numbers so in the 1500s rapael bombelli was trying to deal with an equation of this form and the solution that he had gotten from cardano for this kind of thing was this this algorithm that you see here in both maths code and also closure code and you can see see the problem right away there's a boundary condition where P cubed is greater than Q ^2 after which one needs to take the square root of a negative number and it returns none right so it's no good but bombelli grafted the two components that he was trying to compare here and Visually confirmed that they converge and he was primarily an engineer so he did what any engineer would do he cluded it yeah so he used a placeholder and this placeholder had a special behavior in these situations and he got this from cardano who had invented it but said it was completely useless and he then wrote a book bom belly then wrote a book about how to solve these problems right and and the textual description you see here is from that book except the part with i in it was actually retrofitted in the addition that I screencapped and although I've read these books I'm not recommending any from this period because they predate anything like modern notation and the Expedition all looks like this walls of text with funny drawings but his method worked which did not stop as you can imagine everyone from sincerely hating it and one of the reasons they hated it which is hinted at at the bottom there is it seemed to violate the rules of of mult application it just didn't make sense and it also looks arbitrary and magical because they were still under the influence of the Greeks in their perspective on numbers now all of you already know that I stands for imagin Imaginary but to get a sense of the vibe Dart coined the term imaginary number as an insult to the very idea that such a thing could exist right this is how people felt about these numbers but over the next 250 years because they simplified calculations involving trig they gained ground and by the early 1800s argand and gaus and vessel all independently figured out that their special geometric numbers that encode rotations in a 2d plane which In fairness was a concept that did not exist in bomb Bell's time so we can forgive him for not noticing uh some find this easier uh easier to see if they look at it like this right this illustration shows that with each exponentiation I rotates by 90 degrees and notice how this feels kind of relative to what we saw earlier with the number line where sign flips sign flips cause rotations now that we have two we're kind of able to cut that in half and there's more going on that I can't explain to a general audience in the time I have but in my opinion the move to complex numbers was the biggest jump in in the history of math up to that point to having real geometric objects things that can represent the kind of world that we perceive and uh another important fact about this is that once you get to them you can't really keep pretending that these are numbers in the same sense as you know the number of goats we're we're somewhere else now we have escaped the naturalistic idea of numbers altogether and I think this is inevitable I think without it the gymnast part of our brains would never have a chance so we're caught up to mid 1800s they were what you might call electrifying times right so the study of what we now call electromagnetism was heating up and Commercial applications were becoming very important the internet boom of the time was the telegraph right it came into commercial use by 1840 submarine cables were laid by 1850 how's that for Progress how's that for building right so this allowed rapid communication between continents for the first time to give you some sense of what that meant it used to take two and a half months for a piece of mail to get from London to Sydney this chart shows you various ones but we're not going to linger on it because it's not the main point of this so this period is where electrical engineering began it was in the context of a different kind of information technology the information of telegraphy right and our computers descend directly from the Telegraph and telephone Claud Shannon's Master thesis which is written only about 80 years later laid the blueprint for our digital computers by applying Boolean algebra to analog relays in the telephone system and the people who were working on this stuff at the time were sort of Matha physicists right because they they hadn't divided into two disciplines at this stage all mathematicians were physicist and vice versa at least close to that and the big problem they faced was coming up with a system for calcul involving 3D space including rotations this was especially important for representing the ideas contained in Maxwell's equations which we will look at now so this block that you see on the left there that's what Maxwell actually wrote down and it's a lot you know there's a lot of stuff there and the stuff on the right which is much more concise and actually much more clear if you happen to have learned how to read this particular notation was created by uh somebody called Gibbs and another person called heavyside one of them in the US one of them UK and it's the system that's taught today and even if you can't read it you can recognize how much more concise it is and that it contains basically the same mathematical information means we're winning right we're we're able to communicate more in less space but the notational system that I prefer and that I'm kind of hinting at today captures the same relationship like this so this this is actually even more tur but it does contain all of the relevant information I cannot explain how in the time I have today but but I will link to an explanation with all the details and for this audience I want to instead give a very gental introduction to this notation which is called geometric algebra we're going to start with these Two Fellas so the black and white one is grasson and the other is Clifford grasson was a German High School teacher who invented most of vectric algebra as a side quest while studying title theory in his fair time this guy was a genius unfortunately his writing was as muddy as his ideas were brilliant so his work made almost no impact during his lifetime Clifford was an English mathematician born somewhat later and also an astronomer and he was one of the few to read and understand grassman's work which he combined with Hamilton's querian and he created this system that he called geometric algebra but that many modern speakers call Clifford algebra in his honored unfortunately he died of tuberculosis at 33 so I suspect we'd have standardized on his approach if he'd lived long enough to make the case for it over the following decades and the uh to talk about this system We'll add a couple more objects and operations to our protocol call so now we have something like this right multiplication has trifurcated we have three kinds of multiplication so the dot product the wed wedge product and the geometric product and then we have vectors which I'm calling here K vectors for reasons that we will loop back around to in a couple of minutes so what do we talk about when we talk about vectors they're geometric objects they're not numbers like they're definitely not numbers but they represent a combination of a length and a direction and we'll often call the length a magnitude which is fancy Latin for bigness and we're going to cover this idea in 2D because that's easier so we're gonna start with this right so here you see these two orthogonal basis vectors so here we have two arrows one who's positive extent extends to the right called E1 and one that extends upward called E2 they're both of unit length which is to say of magnitude one note that the written as E1 and E2 not as X and Y well that's because we as programmers when we see ourselves giving individual names to ordered sequences of similar things we start to think maybe there should be an array with indices or something and in that Spirit we're using these numbered terms so you can add them together like this right uh and you can add them adding them together along with some scalar multiple of each allows you to create any Arrow of any length pointing in any angle right it's just linear combinations of these basis vectors and you can also subtract them and subtraction flips the sign of the subtracted one and this is actually very similar to what we saw earlier with the positive and negative number line right you change the direction of the thing you learned all this this is all the same as what you learned in vector algebra at school the dot product also pretty much the same as what you learned at school so so this is a thing that measures the the co extent of these two lines through a through distance and if you use unit vectors that if you normalize to a length of one of the two you get the cosine back out and then we have this guy which is the wedge product right so this guy is for those of you with a lot of linear algebra it's a generalization of another product that you've already seen called the cross product and what this guy does is he returns instead of like the cross product returns a vector this guy returns a b Vector so the bi Vector is this thing you see on the right hand side here which if a vector is a line that goes in a direction for some distance this is an oriented area so it's just a higher Dimension analog to a vector and you can see that one Arrow points to the tail of the other arrow and then there's a circle in the middle the circle represents the direction that you would rotate in order to bring the head of the second arrow to the tail of the ladder right and we use the reason I like these so much compared to other formulations is that if you Ed by vectors to provide uh your representation of torque and angular momentum in the magnetic field your computations are actually much more concise and make more geometric sense which we'll cover more in just a second and then the most important one of these new kinds of multiplication is something called the geometric product which as you see here is just taking the dot product and adding it to the wedge product now that's kind of weird right because one of them is returning a scalar and the other one's returning this funny bi Vector thing but we've actually seen this exact same relationship a few minutes ago and that's in the complex numbers so so it it turns out that the imaginary number I was actually just the unit by Vector all along and what was once kind of an algebraic ghost turns out to be a consequence of the geometry of space now this is another one where I'll have to link to the supporting materials but man the algebraic expansion that proves this is extremely beautiful now I'm going to compare this approach to the approach that we mostly use like if you go and take Vector there are a lot of matricies involved and to me the Matrix approach kind of treats vectors as tuples with Benefits right it's still it's a series of numbers and you have to pick the numbers apart and then you put them into these matrices and then you grind the crank on the side and you get you get the answer but the geometric intuition that you get from doing that is usually pretty poor and it takes a lot of time and work to get students to understand what these matrices mean in contrast using geometric algebra you can if you need a specific rotation uh by an angle here you do something looks exactly like what you would do with a complex number and you can also just rotate by another bi Vector so simple multiplication you can say hey I've got a line that points this way and I want to take the product of this line and that line and you'll get a rotation which is kind of amazing uh as we will see later this this makes a lot of things way easier so moving on from there I will recommend this paper because it can give you the rigorous treatment that you are craving right now that I cannot provide in this short talk so this is called imaginary numbers are not real it's by Gull lenb and Duran these are three physicists who've done loads of work over the last 20 years to popularize GA in their writing it it's everything is very accessible and if you have high school level maths you can you can plow through it so we've been talking about this all in 2D which has has this particular uh set of entities but one of the great strengths about this approach is that as you go up in Dimensions you keep exactly the same operations and you have sort of equivalent objects so we're going to just take a quick look at what the 3D case might look like which is this so we talked about how a bi Vector is what happens when you wedge together two vectors right then you get this area but if you wedge together three of those you get an oriented volume so all the same operations work the same way in three dimensions as they worked in two Dimensions you don't have a lot of new stuff to learn and this is very different from how we normally teach this stuff normally as you go to three dimensions you learn two or three different uh pieces of the toolkit that only ever work in three dimensions like the cross product but here you just keep doing things the same way you were doing them and it continues to work as you go up and this is why we call them K vectors because really what you have is not a vector a bi Vector Tri Vector what you have is a one vector two Vector three Vector four Vector however many Vector that you need and this turns out to be super useful in physics in fact variations on geometric algebra have been reinvented repeatedly over history because the original notation we had was insufficient so p and der algebras are just geometric algebras invented by physicists to solve physical problems without even knowing that Clifford's results had existed and all of this this huge zoo of geometric Concepts that we use in technical mathematics are all representable inside geometric algebra so instead of having to learn like you know 10 different things to do your your basic engineering or physics work you learn one thing and you keep using it so what we can say about geometric algebra is it kind of combines align areas and volumes now there are other things we care about in Geometry that are not there as you can imagine right there are no planes uh for example there are no spheres things like that so there have to be extensions and uh being able to operate in however many dimensions you please is great but you kind of need to add one more thing to get the full magic of the system and unfortunately it is the most subtle and hard to explain thing here so we're going to get extra extra handwavy now so that's metrics right so so this is in our programming language metaphor these are this is a bit like metaprogramming where you say I want an algebra and I want this many dimensions of the AL algebra to square to minus one like B vectors do but I also want some that's squared to either one or zero the more mathematically sophisticated among you be saying oh yeah so if you need a hyperbolic space you could have this and so on and that's exactly it you can you can then represent more different kinds of spaces this way and once you do that you can Source a up a vast variety of the tools that we use for technical mathematics as these little metric versions of geometric algebra so here are some examples now this is not in any sense a complete list but these are some very popular tools that you can get in this way uh and I'll I'll shout out a couple in particular right so the um macowski SpaceTime is super cool for doing physics and a lot of people are using it for that purpose and if you look at the conformal geometric algebra the last one on the list this one is neat because it has his basic objects things like spheres and so if you want a circle you look at the intersection of two spheres and the part where they meet is a circle and there are situations where that is pretty great but for me the one that is most interesting uh for the things I do day in and day out is projective geometric algebra which I use a lot for computer Graphics applications and for that I'm going to recommend this paper and I'll say that that this line of research really kicked off in 2000 in the context of Robotics when people were looking for better ways to uh to handle the geometry of the world inside of a a situated agent and there was a fellow called zelig who wrote a really nice paper I will link to it and that was followed up by theoretical work by a fellow called Charles Gun uh but because of the background of this audience I think the best paper for you if you're interested in this part is this one by dor and deenik uh and these same people have many Fantastic video presentations on YouTube you can find great stuff about this that will go in depth and Deen in particular is a tireless Advocate who has built a fantastic JavaScript playground for this stuff called ganja uh but in the meantime time we're going to do a little bit of ill-advised live coding right [Applause] so okay so we have our friend emac here and we have a little box you'll notice it's closure code sorry for the non list people there's a JavaScript version of this I I will link to as well which you know if you need infix it has it for you uh so so this is one of those metric things where I'm I'm declaring this uh this certain algebra of these dimensions and and this metric and I'm not going to explain what that means at the moment these are kind of throwaway things that are building that box by knowing how to make uh vertices and edges you got some starter state for a couple of things and then this this function here is uh the entire physics engine and and I want to make clear that what I'm about to show you there's nothing underneath right this is just uh this is just a mathematics library that I'm using to do this so I'm going to come down here and I'm going to uncomment this line and and our little friend the Box will start to bounce around as soon as I can get my mouse over there all right right so the reason we can do this with only like three lines of code to account for Gravity hooks law and a damping function is because the entities that we're using in this context know about both direction and rotation and magnitude all at the same time so this is actually pretty cool now those of you who do a lot of physics or Graphics programming probably think well you know 2D it's not that big a deal right I mean so what happens if we change this to a three and we come over here and we do it again oh it's it's a cube now so you'll note a couple of things here I didn't change a single line of code other than the dimensionality that's pretty boss actually normally you'd have to do a bunch of stuff like if you're a graphics programmer you can clap it's okay now I'm going to change but you know what if we wanted four dimensions how about a tesseract on a string right like that's pretty [Applause] cool so I I'll post later I'll post a blog post or something where I go into line by line what's happening here but it it is pretty amazing and the code because it's in this nice lispy language is basically onetoone with the mathematics that we would otherwise use so uh oh I can't get back to my notes I'm trapped in live coding forever let's see which I guess isn't the worst thing that could happen there we go all right so all right so hopefully this tiny taste has been enough to attract your interest we're pretty much out of time but before you go I need to mention David Hennis that's this joyful looking man here in the 1960s he started work on a research program aimed at refactoring the notation used for technical mathematics using geometric algebra and my first exposure to these ideas was in an 80s paper of his that used geometric algebra to explore theong as a lens on understanding direct theory of electrons it was mind-blowing it blew my mind and after after spending some time with it I came to agree with this quote from David Estus right so this is a way that we we can just move everything into a single formalism and simplify everything that we're doing this is a chance we have to refactor things in a way that could reduce by maybe two or three years the time it takes to educate a young physicist and in so doing make more advanced topics accessible to many more people this would I believe result in real progress in The Sciences which is why I care enough to bring this to your attention today and if this talk inspires you to read only one paper I would ask you to read David EST Stan's 2002 or metal lecture in which he makes this case very very well and I'll close with this quote from hen's old Professor Richard fan and a few thank yous uh first I'd like to thank Alex Miller for his tireless efforts organizing one of the best technology conferences in the world for all these years can we yeah and I'd like to thank the organizers of papers we love Zan shout out for for inviting me I'd like to thank my friend heish Todd for telling me over lunch in Berlin a few years ago that an active Community had formed around geometric algebra thus renewing my hopes for the future I'd like to give thanks to my colleagues at next journal for tolerating my eent excentricities and supporting my work including the creation of this talk and lastly and of course thanks to all of you for [Applause] listening"

        "text": "so last year I gave a talk of strange Loop where I said everyone is programming wrong this this upset some people and I thought I'd make a more modest claim today everyone is doing mathematics wrong so so we'll need some background to make sense of what follows and I'm going to start with a very easy question what is mathematics and where does it come from famously no one has ever struggled with this one so there are many lenses for this question I'm going to supply one to serve for the duration of this talk I I think we both discover and invent mathematics as we go and the part of what we discover is the nature of our own evolved capabilities and we'll start with geometry which is in my opinion the basis for everything else we have Okay so from this little guy here uh upper right quadrant for you uh we have a half billion year old bug likee Cambrian swimmer and then we have bug eating early mammals and then we have a buge eating prian I mean giving our family tree it's no surprise that our software is full of bugs but we have something else in common which is that we all Survive by moving through 3D space and to move through space you need to be able to plan based on what you're sensing which requires you to emulate the world to make predictions about future States so this is Simone biles one of the greatest gymnasts ever to compete she's showing truly Elite human spatial and thus geometric ability and my contention is that everything we do in technical mathematics the kind we use in engineering and most physics comes from the same evolved capacities allow her to plan and execute that elaborate series of translations and rotations and our ability to turn those physical gifts inward is what has given us sculpture and perspective drawing as well as mathematical geometry and our ability to reason about objects in space LED naturally to our number sense now many animals have been shown to count objects and work with sequences and there seems to be a natural development of pattern matching and interacting with objects in the world most of you know that pigeons and rats can learn to press a lever a certain number of times to get a treat what you might be more surprised to learn is that red Forest ants can count to around 20 and communicate those quantities to other ants and some animals can apply short-term memory to sequences better than most humans this chimp is memorizing these numerical sequences and tapping them out after they're uded this is something at which the average chimp outperforms the average human this brings us to algebra so while numb exists in some extent to in most animals in geometric sense probably exists in all complex life forms algebra is more specifically human it has biological roots in language and deliberation so this is the first paper I'll recommend today even though it has nothing to do with computer science or mathematics it's an especially good followup to the research on bias that you might have seen from kotan and tki and things like thinking fast and slow their claim and I I think they're right is that as a group living species our reason abilities Rose in the context of deliberation which gave rise to persuasion and the skeptical evaluation of claims and this arms race between these facilities reified cause and effect reasoning into a conscious reflective and linguistic process formal logic and symbolic fluencies seem to be Downstream of this and once we translated the ability to communicate via streams of words and symbols that is to say into art and writing we were able to develop notation at which point we move from biology to culture in our story here today and one of the most successful cultural artifacts of all time is math notation so we might ask what's it for it's both for communication and for thinking you know the Simplicity and Clarity of a good notation not only allows us to serialize our understanding and transmit it to other human beings it also becomes an engine for our own thinking in the context of physics and Engineering we really want that notation to speak as directly as possible to our inner gymnast so that we can bring our deepest evolved powers to bear on whatever problem we're solving as Bertrand Russell puts it here a good notation can be a teacher unto itself you bounce your ideas off of formalism that guide you to a deeper understanding that said if he were alive today I think he'd go further in Champion Machine readable notation that is to say programming language anybody here who has both worked with an Al through an algebraic problem on paper and also used an interactive programming system like for example Mathematica will be able to attest the power of the ladder for improving understanding so I'm going to look at mathematics uh mathematical dotation through a programming language lens throughout the day and this is an eccentric way of doing this and I'm going to anachronistically project back ideas that didn't exist at the Times these things were invented uh and I I'm doing this both because this is a an audience of mostly programmers with varying levels of mathematical ability but also so because I think we do need to apply what we've learned from programming languages in the 20th century so this notation is really it's it's one of our best tools for thought and I don't have time to make the full argument for this and for the need to move to machine readable uh notations here today but I will recommend strongly this paper by susman and wisdom which discusses the work they did creating a scheme based curriculum for classical mechanics if You' prefer it in talk Mo uh talk form check out susman's programming for the expression of ideas and Sam Richie talks about Emy a closure report of susman system which I I hope you all saw at his talk earlier today at this conference so what do we really want for this kind of notation well we want a small number of orthal Primitives it's going to be purely functional because mathematics is it'll have recursive definitions and it'll be lightly objectoriented and I mean that in the sense that it will have generic dispatch of some set of operations over a family of mathematical objects so let's build a protocol for arithmetic in the same order our cultural ancestors did starting with the natural numbers the non- negative integers now I say non- negative but a fun fact about the natural numbers that there's still to this day no agreement as to whether they include zero these are the numbers we use in informal or folk mathematics the ones we share with those Forest ANS we saw earlier they're very tangible and intuitive you can do the first three operations on this slide with any kind of object in the in the natural world division is a bit weird right you either have to accept that the operation returns a tuple of quotient and remainder which initially feels like a type error or you need to invent fractions at which point you have rational numbers but only the positive ones so this would be whole numbers and vulgar fractions right now these are usually uh presented after the integers for set theoretical reasons but we're working today in the order in which these are normally discovered rather than the order in which they're taught so then we have a protocol that looks like this right we've got these four operations we've got these types now the first people we see using this protocol are in ancient Mesopotamia these objects you see here are almost 6,000 years old the thing on the top is called a bulla which is a kind of spherical clay envelope and the smaller things below are stylized representations of trade goods let's say the middle row are Quant tokens yeah so I might put three of them in a bullet and then seal it with a amazing cryptographically secure cylinder seal of people walking to the left as you see here and then later you could drop by my bakery and collect your pastries so this is tangible Computing in an extreme sense right so over time they switched using tokens to make impressions in clay tablets so you could just push the goat token down five times and say well that's five goats and then they move to drawing you know directly on the clay and making tally marks which gets a little better better fun things to note about this piece of History sculpture preceded writing our first forms of writing were about numbers and accounting and credit long precede the invention of money anyway these were very intelligent people so they quickly invented a more abstract numerical notation that looked like this now it's base 60 unlike our base 10 numbers but they had a true place value system like we do not like Roman numerals and 60 is actually a boss way to do this because it has all these factors so if you're living in a world where you're doing everything with fractions as they were it's amazing to be able to factor all of your numbers they even did their uh their division by multiplication of fractions so instead of dividing something by two they would multiply it by 1/2 or as as we put it these days multiplication by reciprocals and to make that fast they had big pre-computed tablets of reciprocals squares cubes uh roots and everything else which we see Engineers doing in our culture as late as the 20th century right up until there were computers so you might ask what did they get up to with all these numbers so I call this tablet a paper I love but it's actually a 4,000 year old old homework assignment right so what's this person doing this young scribe they're solving a problem of area using using Pythagoras Theorem which you'll note is named after someone born 1500 years later and the uniform writing in the middle shows the square root of two to six decimal places they were iteratively approximating irrational numbers in Babylon which is why God struck them down actually so so what were they doing like they developed these tools for surveying initially because they were calculating the areas of parcels and fields which as as an agrarian people you'd expect and they were doing a lot of astronomy because they had a moon-based calendar the way everybody does a lunar calendar and they needed to square it with the solar on so they knew when to plant for the seasons and all that but they went way past what was reasonable for this purpose everything was Surplus to requirements it's pretty clear to me reading these old tablets that the scribal class was composed of the same kind of curious weirdos who invent everything everywhere in every culture they solved quadratic and cubic equations they worked worked with exponential growth and interest rates they even came up with a fourar analysis to compute the ephemeris so they could pick out where the plans would be in the future this is approximately on par with European mathematics 3500 years later so you might wonder why weren't we on the Moon by like a thousand BCE right you know they were prosperous and they were so close to inventing modern technical mathematics to put in perspective we're only about 600 years after European mathematics reached the same point and the answer as it so often is yeah so their agric cultural technology that allowed them to feed their big cities and develop their sophisticated culture was unsustainable the soil grew depleted and salty over time reducing crop yields and then there was an interval of rapid and severe climate change that led to famine and War any resemblance to the current ERA is I'm sure entirely coincidental and no cause for alarm anyway after around 1550 BC there's a dramatic fallof of mathematical tablets all you get are things like this King telling that King that he's going to go kill him if he doesn't give him enough whatever and we don't see very much mathematical progress for about a thousand years this was a long period of relative stagnation The Good the highlights I can give is the Greeks invented basic formal proofs around 600 BC and a couple of people came up with good ways to approximate the area under a curve but otherwise not much was happening and one of the reasons for all of this stagnation was that the Greeks really hated irrational mbers although Babylonians and Egyptians were okay with approximating the square root of two the Greeks thought that they were an Abomination if contemporary counsel to be believed people were murdered in ancient Greece for talking about these numbers which violated closely held philosophical ideas ultimately they wanted Mass to be like the counting with tokens thing that we saw earlier which I contend held them back for quite some time so for the next thousand or so years after that various cultures took turns shepherding the torch of the surviving wisdom of the Ancients the Greeks the Persians Indian mathematicians the House of Wisdom in Baghdad Brahma Gupta and Alaris or as important to what we have today as Dart and gaus but in the interest of time we're just going to skip forward to Italy in the 1800s so by that time our protocol has grown to include a few more types right we have most of the numeric types that we recognize but we still have the same four basic methods over it and uh some of these numbers are a bit weird like the irrationals are odd but if you squinted them long enough you can kind of pretend they're at least the same kind of thing as the natural numbers because we're interested in Geometry let's just take a quick look at these numbers through a spatial or a geometric lens right so spatially this number line is a bit strange right we don't we're not taught that it's weird but it is weird because we have an infinite line but somehow it also has an end at zero and it's a singularity beneath which subtraction fails so you know to to really get somewhere you need negative numbers and as you might imagine people hated negative numbers too they really despise them uh and this is mainly because it's not intuitively obvious that you can have minus three goats right it just doesn't make sense so diantus said any negative solution to equation was automatically false livets hated them and they didn't start to be widely used until the mid 19th century which is kind of crazy from our modern perspective now I think they're actually more radical than the irrationals because they changed the spatial interpretation of the number line in a very important way so we now have the origin in the middle of the line and an infinite extent to either side it's symmetrical so we can think of addition and subtraction as translation in a point in this Infinite Space and more interestingly we can interpret the sign flip we get with multiplication by minus one is a rotation around the origin by 180 deges some of the mathematicians here are saying could also be a reflection and that's true but today we're going to pretend it's only a rotation so by so by adding a new kind of number we get a new kind of space actually that allows both translation and a limited form of rotation and the next big discovery which many of you have already guessed was complex numbers so in the 1500s rapael bombelli was trying to deal with an equation of this form and the solution that he had gotten from cardano for this kind of thing was this this algorithm that you see here in both maths code and also closure code and you can see see the problem right away there's a boundary condition where P cubed is greater than Q ^2 after which one needs to take the square root of a negative number and it returns none right so it's no good but bombelli grafted the two components that he was trying to compare here and Visually confirmed that they converge and he was primarily an engineer so he did what any engineer would do he cluded it yeah so he used a placeholder and this placeholder had a special behavior in these situations and he got this from cardano who had invented it but said it was completely useless and he then wrote a book bom belly then wrote a book about how to solve these problems right and and the textual description you see here is from that book except the part with i in it was actually retrofitted in the addition that I screencapped and although I've read these books I'm not recommending any from this period because they predate anything like modern notation and the Expedition all looks like this walls of text with funny drawings but his method worked which did not stop as you can imagine everyone from sincerely hating it and one of the reasons they hated it which is hinted at at the bottom there is it seemed to violate the rules of of mult application it just didn't make sense and it also looks arbitrary and magical because they were still under the influence of the Greeks in their perspective on numbers now all of you already know that I stands for imagin Imaginary but to get a sense of the vibe Dart coined the term imaginary number as an insult to the very idea that such a thing could exist right this is how people felt about these numbers but over the next 250 years because they simplified calculations involving trig they gained ground and by the early 1800s argand and gaus and vessel all independently figured out that their special geometric numbers that encode rotations in a 2d plane which In fairness was a concept that did not exist in bomb Bell's time so we can forgive him for not noticing uh some find this easier uh easier to see if they look at it like this right this illustration shows that with each exponentiation I rotates by 90 degrees and notice how this feels kind of relative to what we saw earlier with the number line where sign flips sign flips cause rotations now that we have two we're kind of able to cut that in half and there's more going on that I can't explain to a general audience in the time I have but in my opinion the move to complex numbers was the biggest jump in in the history of math up to that point to having real geometric objects things that can represent the kind of world that we perceive and uh another important fact about this is that once you get to them you can't really keep pretending that these are numbers in the same sense as you know the number of goats we're we're somewhere else now we have escaped the naturalistic idea of numbers altogether and I think this is inevitable I think without it the gymnast part of our brains would never have a chance so we're caught up to mid 1800s they were what you might call electrifying times right so the study of what we now call electromagnetism was heating up and Commercial applications were becoming very important the internet boom of the time was the telegraph right it came into commercial use by 1840 submarine cables were laid by 1850 how's that for Progress how's that for building right so this allowed rapid communication between continents for the first time to give you some sense of what that meant it used to take two and a half months for a piece of mail to get from London to Sydney this chart shows you various ones but we're not going to linger on it because it's not the main point of this so this period is where electrical engineering began it was in the context of a different kind of information technology the information of telegraphy right and our computers descend directly from the Telegraph and telephone Claud Shannon's Master thesis which is written only about 80 years later laid the blueprint for our digital computers by applying Boolean algebra to analog relays in the telephone system and the people who were working on this stuff at the time were sort of Matha physicists right because they they hadn't divided into two disciplines at this stage all mathematicians were physicist and vice versa at least close to that and the big problem they faced was coming up with a system for calcul involving 3D space including rotations this was especially important for representing the ideas contained in Maxwell's equations which we will look at now so this block that you see on the left there that's what Maxwell actually wrote down and it's a lot you know there's a lot of stuff there and the stuff on the right which is much more concise and actually much more clear if you happen to have learned how to read this particular notation was created by uh somebody called Gibbs and another person called heavyside one of them in the US one of them UK and it's the system that's taught today and even if you can't read it you can recognize how much more concise it is and that it contains basically the same mathematical information means we're winning right we're we're able to communicate more in less space but the notational system that I prefer and that I'm kind of hinting at today captures the same relationship like this so this this is actually even more tur but it does contain all of the relevant information I cannot explain how in the time I have today but but I will link to an explanation with all the details and for this audience I want to instead give a very gental introduction to this notation which is called geometric algebra we're going to start with these Two Fellas so the black and white one is grasson and the other is Clifford grasson was a German High School teacher who invented most of vectric algebra as a side quest while studying title theory in his fair time this guy was a genius unfortunately his writing was as muddy as his ideas were brilliant so his work made almost no impact during his lifetime Clifford was an English mathematician born somewhat later and also an astronomer and he was one of the few to read and understand grassman's work which he combined with Hamilton's querian and he created this system that he called geometric algebra but that many modern speakers call Clifford algebra in his honored unfortunately he died of tuberculosis at 33 so I suspect we'd have standardized on his approach if he'd lived long enough to make the case for it over the following decades and the uh to talk about this system We'll add a couple more objects and operations to our protocol call so now we have something like this right multiplication has trifurcated we have three kinds of multiplication so the dot product the wed wedge product and the geometric product and then we have vectors which I'm calling here K vectors for reasons that we will loop back around to in a couple of minutes so what do we talk about when we talk about vectors they're geometric objects they're not numbers like they're definitely not numbers but they represent a combination of a length and a direction and we'll often call the length a magnitude which is fancy Latin for bigness and we're going to cover this idea in 2D because that's easier so we're gonna start with this right so here you see these two orthogonal basis vectors so here we have two arrows one who's positive extent extends to the right called E1 and one that extends upward called E2 they're both of unit length which is to say of magnitude one note that the written as E1 and E2 not as X and Y well that's because we as programmers when we see ourselves giving individual names to ordered sequences of similar things we start to think maybe there should be an array with indices or something and in that Spirit we're using these numbered terms so you can add them together like this right uh and you can add them adding them together along with some scalar multiple of each allows you to create any Arrow of any length pointing in any angle right it's just linear combinations of these basis vectors and you can also subtract them and subtraction flips the sign of the subtracted one and this is actually very similar to what we saw earlier with the positive and negative number line right you change the direction of the thing you learned all this this is all the same as what you learned in vector algebra at school the dot product also pretty much the same as what you learned at school so so this is a thing that measures the the co extent of these two lines through a through distance and if you use unit vectors that if you normalize to a length of one of the two you get the cosine back out and then we have this guy which is the wedge product right so this guy is for those of you with a lot of linear algebra it's a generalization of another product that you've already seen called the cross product and what this guy does is he returns instead of like the cross product returns a vector this guy returns a b Vector so the bi Vector is this thing you see on the right hand side here which if a vector is a line that goes in a direction for some distance this is an oriented area so it's just a higher Dimension analog to a vector and you can see that one Arrow points to the tail of the other arrow and then there's a circle in the middle the circle represents the direction that you would rotate in order to bring the head of the second arrow to the tail of the ladder right and we use the reason I like these so much compared to other formulations is that if you Ed by vectors to provide uh your representation of torque and angular momentum in the magnetic field your computations are actually much more concise and make more geometric sense which we'll cover more in just a second and then the most important one of these new kinds of multiplication is something called the geometric product which as you see here is just taking the dot product and adding it to the wedge product now that's kind of weird right because one of them is returning a scalar and the other one's returning this funny bi Vector thing but we've actually seen this exact same relationship a few minutes ago and that's in the complex numbers so so it it turns out that the imaginary number I was actually just the unit by Vector all along and what was once kind of an algebraic ghost turns out to be a consequence of the geometry of space now this is another one where I'll have to link to the supporting materials but man the algebraic expansion that proves this is extremely beautiful now I'm going to compare this approach to the approach that we mostly use like if you go and take Vector there are a lot of matricies involved and to me the Matrix approach kind of treats vectors as tuples with Benefits right it's still it's a series of numbers and you have to pick the numbers apart and then you put them into these matrices and then you grind the crank on the side and you get you get the answer but the geometric intuition that you get from doing that is usually pretty poor and it takes a lot of time and work to get students to understand what these matrices mean in contrast using geometric algebra you can if you need a specific rotation uh by an angle here you do something looks exactly like what you would do with a complex number and you can also just rotate by another bi Vector so simple multiplication you can say hey I've got a line that points this way and I want to take the product of this line and that line and you'll get a rotation which is kind of amazing uh as we will see later this this makes a lot of things way easier so moving on from there I will recommend this paper because it can give you the rigorous treatment that you are craving right now that I cannot provide in this short talk so this is called imaginary numbers are not real it's by Gull lenb and Duran these are three physicists who've done loads of work over the last 20 years to popularize GA in their writing it it's everything is very accessible and if you have high school level maths you can you can plow through it so we've been talking about this all in 2D which has has this particular uh set of entities but one of the great strengths about this approach is that as you go up in Dimensions you keep exactly the same operations and you have sort of equivalent objects so we're going to just take a quick look at what the 3D case might look like which is this so we talked about how a bi Vector is what happens when you wedge together two vectors right then you get this area but if you wedge together three of those you get an oriented volume so all the same operations work the same way in three dimensions as they worked in two Dimensions you don't have a lot of new stuff to learn and this is very different from how we normally teach this stuff normally as you go to three dimensions you learn two or three different uh pieces of the toolkit that only ever work in three dimensions like the cross product but here you just keep doing things the same way you were doing them and it continues to work as you go up and this is why we call them K vectors because really what you have is not a vector a bi Vector Tri Vector what you have is a one vector two Vector three Vector four Vector however many Vector that you need and this turns out to be super useful in physics in fact variations on geometric algebra have been reinvented repeatedly over history because the original notation we had was insufficient so p and der algebras are just geometric algebras invented by physicists to solve physical problems without even knowing that Clifford's results had existed and all of this this huge zoo of geometric Concepts that we use in technical mathematics are all representable inside geometric algebra so instead of having to learn like you know 10 different things to do your your basic engineering or physics work you learn one thing and you keep using it so what we can say about geometric algebra is it kind of combines align areas and volumes now there are other things we care about in Geometry that are not there as you can imagine right there are no planes uh for example there are no spheres things like that so there have to be extensions and uh being able to operate in however many dimensions you please is great but you kind of need to add one more thing to get the full magic of the system and unfortunately it is the most subtle and hard to explain thing here so we're going to get extra extra handwavy now so that's metrics right so so this is in our programming language metaphor these are this is a bit like metaprogramming where you say I want an algebra and I want this many dimensions of the AL algebra to square to minus one like B vectors do but I also want some that's squared to either one or zero the more mathematically sophisticated among you be saying oh yeah so if you need a hyperbolic space you could have this and so on and that's exactly it you can you can then represent more different kinds of spaces this way and once you do that you can Source a up a vast variety of the tools that we use for technical mathematics as these little metric versions of geometric algebra so here are some examples now this is not in any sense a complete list but these are some very popular tools that you can get in this way uh and I'll I'll shout out a couple in particular right so the um macowski SpaceTime is super cool for doing physics and a lot of people are using it for that purpose and if you look at the conformal geometric algebra the last one on the list this one is neat because it has his basic objects things like spheres and so if you want a circle you look at the intersection of two spheres and the part where they meet is a circle and there are situations where that is pretty great but for me the one that is most interesting uh for the things I do day in and day out is projective geometric algebra which I use a lot for computer Graphics applications and for that I'm going to recommend this paper and I'll say that that this line of research really kicked off in 2000 in the context of Robotics when people were looking for better ways to uh to handle the geometry of the world inside of a a situated agent and there was a fellow called zelig who wrote a really nice paper I will link to it and that was followed up by theoretical work by a fellow called Charles Gun uh but because of the background of this audience I think the best paper for you if you're interested in this part is this one by dor and deenik uh and these same people have many Fantastic video presentations on YouTube you can find great stuff about this that will go in depth and Deen in particular is a tireless Advocate who has built a fantastic JavaScript playground for this stuff called ganja uh but in the meantime time we're going to do a little bit of ill-advised live coding right [Applause] so okay so we have our friend emac here and we have a little box you'll notice it's closure code sorry for the non list people there's a JavaScript version of this I I will link to as well which you know if you need infix it has it for you uh so so this is one of those metric things where I'm I'm declaring this uh this certain algebra of these dimensions and and this metric and I'm not going to explain what that means at the moment these are kind of throwaway things that are building that box by knowing how to make uh vertices and edges you got some starter state for a couple of things and then this this function here is uh the entire physics engine and and I want to make clear that what I'm about to show you there's nothing underneath right this is just uh this is just a mathematics library that I'm using to do this so I'm going to come down here and I'm going to uncomment this line and and our little friend the Box will start to bounce around as soon as I can get my mouse over there all right right so the reason we can do this with only like three lines of code to account for Gravity hooks law and a damping function is because the entities that we're using in this context know about both direction and rotation and magnitude all at the same time so this is actually pretty cool now those of you who do a lot of physics or Graphics programming probably think well you know 2D it's not that big a deal right I mean so what happens if we change this to a three and we come over here and we do it again oh it's it's a cube now so you'll note a couple of things here I didn't change a single line of code other than the dimensionality that's pretty boss actually normally you'd have to do a bunch of stuff like if you're a graphics programmer you can clap it's okay now I'm going to change but you know what if we wanted four dimensions how about a tesseract on a string right like that's pretty [Applause] cool so I I'll post later I'll post a blog post or something where I go into line by line what's happening here but it it is pretty amazing and the code because it's in this nice lispy language is basically onetoone with the mathematics that we would otherwise use so uh oh I can't get back to my notes I'm trapped in live coding forever let's see which I guess isn't the worst thing that could happen there we go all right so all right so hopefully this tiny taste has been enough to attract your interest we're pretty much out of time but before you go I need to mention David Hennis that's this joyful looking man here in the 1960s he started work on a research program aimed at refactoring the notation used for technical mathematics using geometric algebra and my first exposure to these ideas was in an 80s paper of his that used geometric algebra to explore theong as a lens on understanding direct theory of electrons it was mind-blowing it blew my mind and after after spending some time with it I came to agree with this quote from David Estus right so this is a way that we we can just move everything into a single formalism and simplify everything that we're doing this is a chance we have to refactor things in a way that could reduce by maybe two or three years the time it takes to educate a young physicist and in so doing make more advanced topics accessible to many more people this would I believe result in real progress in The Sciences which is why I care enough to bring this to your attention today and if this talk inspires you to read only one paper I would ask you to read David EST Stan's 2002 or metal lecture in which he makes this case very very well and I'll close with this quote from hen's old Professor Richard fan and a few thank yous uh first I'd like to thank Alex Miller for his tireless efforts organizing one of the best technology conferences in the world for all these years can we yeah and I'd like to thank the organizers of papers we love Zan shout out for for inviting me I'd like to thank my friend heish Todd for telling me over lunch in Berlin a few years ago that an active Community had formed around geometric algebra thus renewing my hopes for the future I'd like to give thanks to my colleagues at next journal for tolerating my eent excentricities and supporting my work including the creation of this talk and lastly and of course thanks to all of you for [Applause] listening"

        "text": "so so we'll need some background to make sense of what follows and I'm going to start with a very easy question what is mathematics and where does it come from famously no one has ever struggled with this one so there are many lenses for this question I'm going to supply one to serve for the duration of this talk I I think we both discover and invent mathematics as we go and the part of what we discover is the nature of our own evolved capabilities and we'll start with geometry which is in my opinion the basis for everything else we have Okay so from this little guy here uh upper right quadrant for you uh we have a half billion year old bug likee Cambrian swimmer and then we have bug eating early mammals and then we have a buge eating prian I mean giving our family tree it's no surprise that our software is full of bugs but we have something else in common which is that we all Survive by moving through 3D space and to move through space you need to be able to plan based on what you're sensing which requires you to emulate the world to make predictions about future States so this is Simone biles one of the greatest gymnasts ever to compete she's showing truly Elite human spatial and thus geometric ability and my contention is that everything we do in technical mathematics the kind we use in engineering and most physics comes from the same evolved capacities allow her to plan and execute that elaborate series of translations and rotations and our ability to turn those physical gifts inward is what has given us sculpture and perspective drawing as well as mathematical geometry and our ability to reason about objects in space LED naturally to our number sense now many animals have been shown to count objects and work with sequences and there seems to be a natural development of pattern matching and interacting with objects in the world most of you know that pigeons and rats can learn to press a lever a certain number of times to get a treat what you might be more surprised to learn is that red Forest ants can count to around 20 and communicate those quantities to other ants and some animals can apply short-term memory to sequences better than most humans this chimp is memorizing these numerical sequences and tapping them out after they're uded this is something at which the average chimp outperforms the average human this brings us to algebra so while numb exists in some extent to in most animals in geometric sense probably exists in all complex life forms algebra is more specifically human it has biological roots in language and deliberation so this is the first paper I'll recommend today even though it has nothing to do with computer science or mathematics it's an especially good followup to the research on bias that you might have seen from kotan and tki and things like thinking fast and slow their claim and I I think they're right is that as a group living species our reason abilities Rose in the context of deliberation which gave rise to persuasion and the skeptical evaluation of claims and this arms race between these facilities reified cause and effect reasoning into a conscious reflective and linguistic process formal logic and symbolic fluencies seem to be Downstream of this and once we translated the ability to communicate via streams of words and symbols that is to say into art and writing we were able to develop notation at which point we move from biology to culture in our story here today and one of the most successful cultural artifacts of all time is math notation so we might ask what's it for it's both for communication and for thinking you know the Simplicity and Clarity of a good notation not only allows us to serialize our understanding and transmit it to other human beings it also becomes an engine for our own thinking in the context of physics and Engineering we really want that notation to speak as directly as possible to our inner gymnast so that we can bring our deepest evolved powers to bear on whatever problem we're solving as Bertrand Russell puts it here a good notation can be a teacher unto itself you bounce your ideas off of formalism that guide you to a deeper understanding that said if he were alive today I think he'd go further in Champion Machine readable notation that is to say programming language anybody here who has both worked with an Al through an algebraic problem on paper and also used an interactive programming system like for example Mathematica will be able to attest the power of the ladder for improving understanding so I'm going to look at mathematics uh mathematical dotation through a programming language lens throughout the day and this is an eccentric way of doing this and I'm going to anachronistically project back ideas that didn't exist at the Times these things were invented uh and I I'm doing this both because this is a an audience of mostly programmers with varying levels of mathematical ability but also so because I think we do need to apply what we've learned from programming languages in the 20th century so this notation is really it's it's one of our best tools for thought and I don't have time to make the full argument for this and for the need to move to machine readable uh notations here today but I will recommend strongly this paper by susman and wisdom which discusses the work they did creating a scheme based curriculum for classical mechanics if You' prefer it in talk Mo uh talk form check out susman's programming for the expression of ideas and Sam Richie talks about Emy a closure report of susman system which I I hope you all saw at his talk earlier today at this conference so what do we really want for this kind of notation well we want a small number of orthal Primitives it's going to be purely functional because mathematics is it'll have recursive definitions and it'll be lightly objectoriented and I mean that in the sense that it will have generic dispatch of some set of operations over a family of mathematical objects so let's build a protocol for arithmetic in the same order our cultural ancestors did starting with the natural numbers the non- negative integers now I say non- negative but a fun fact about the natural numbers that there's still to this day no agreement as to whether they include zero these are the numbers we use in informal or folk mathematics the ones we share with those Forest ANS we saw earlier they're very tangible and intuitive you can do the first three operations on this slide with any kind of object in the in the natural world division is a bit weird right you either have to accept that the operation returns a tuple of quotient and remainder which initially feels like a type error or you need to invent fractions at which point you have rational numbers but only the positive ones so this would be whole numbers and vulgar fractions right now these are usually uh presented after the integers for set theoretical reasons but we're working today in the order in which these are normally discovered rather than the order in which they're taught so then we have a protocol that looks like this right we've got these four operations we've got these types now the first people we see using this protocol are in ancient Mesopotamia these objects you see here are almost 6,000 years old the thing on the top is called a bulla which is a kind of spherical clay envelope and the smaller things below are stylized representations of trade goods let's say the middle row are Quant tokens yeah so I might put three of them in a bullet and then seal it with a amazing cryptographically secure cylinder seal of people walking to the left as you see here and then later you could drop by my bakery and collect your pastries so this is tangible Computing in an extreme sense right so over time they switched using tokens to make impressions in clay tablets so you could just push the goat token down five times and say well that's five goats and then they move to drawing you know directly on the clay and making tally marks which gets a little better better fun things to note about this piece of History sculpture preceded writing our first forms of writing were about numbers and accounting and credit long precede the invention of money anyway these were very intelligent people so they quickly invented a more abstract numerical notation that looked like this now it's base 60 unlike our base 10 numbers but they had a true place value system like we do not like Roman numerals and 60 is actually a boss way to do this because it has all these factors so if you're living in a world where you're doing everything with fractions as they were it's amazing to be able to factor all of your numbers they even did their uh their division by multiplication of fractions so instead of dividing something by two they would multiply it by 1/2 or as as we put it these days multiplication by reciprocals and to make that fast they had big pre-computed tablets of reciprocals squares cubes uh roots and everything else which we see Engineers doing in our culture as late as the 20th century right up until there were computers so you might ask what did they get up to with all these numbers so I call this tablet a paper I love but it's actually a 4,000 year old old homework assignment right so what's this person doing this young scribe they're solving a problem of area using using Pythagoras Theorem which you'll note is named after someone born 1500 years later and the uniform writing in the middle shows the square root of two to six decimal places they were iteratively approximating irrational numbers in Babylon which is why God struck them down actually so so what were they doing like they developed these tools for surveying initially because they were calculating the areas of parcels and fields which as as an agrarian people you'd expect and they were doing a lot of astronomy because they had a moon-based calendar the way everybody does a lunar calendar and they needed to square it with the solar on so they knew when to plant for the seasons and all that but they went way past what was reasonable for this purpose everything was Surplus to requirements it's pretty clear to me reading these old tablets that the scribal class was composed of the same kind of curious weirdos who invent everything everywhere in every culture they solved quadratic and cubic equations they worked worked with exponential growth and interest rates they even came up with a fourar analysis to compute the ephemeris so they could pick out where the plans would be in the future this is approximately on par with European mathematics 3500 years later so you might wonder why weren't we on the Moon by like a thousand BCE right you know they were prosperous and they were so close to inventing modern technical mathematics to put in perspective we're only about 600 years after European mathematics reached the same point and the answer as it so often is yeah so their agric cultural technology that allowed them to feed their big cities and develop their sophisticated culture was unsustainable the soil grew depleted and salty over time reducing crop yields and then there was an interval of rapid and severe climate change that led to famine and War any resemblance to the current ERA is I'm sure entirely coincidental and no cause for alarm anyway after around 1550 BC there's a dramatic fallof of mathematical tablets all you get are things like this King telling that King that he's going to go kill him if he doesn't give him enough whatever and we don't see very much mathematical progress for about a thousand years this was a long period of relative stagnation The Good the highlights I can give is the Greeks invented basic formal proofs around 600 BC and a couple of people came up with good ways to approximate the area under a curve but otherwise not much was happening and one of the reasons for all of this stagnation was that the Greeks really hated irrational mbers although Babylonians and Egyptians were okay with approximating the square root of two the Greeks thought that they were an Abomination if contemporary counsel to be believed people were murdered in ancient Greece for talking about these numbers which violated closely held philosophical ideas ultimately they wanted Mass to be like the counting with tokens thing that we saw earlier which I contend held them back for quite some time so for the next thousand or so years after that various cultures took turns shepherding the torch of the surviving wisdom of the Ancients the Greeks the Persians Indian mathematicians the House of Wisdom in Baghdad Brahma Gupta and Alaris or as important to what we have today as Dart and gaus but in the interest of time we're just going to skip forward to Italy in the 1800s so by that time our protocol has grown to include a few more types right we have most of the numeric types that we recognize but we still have the same four basic methods over it and uh some of these numbers are a bit weird like the irrationals are odd but if you squinted them long enough you can kind of pretend they're at least the same kind of thing as the natural numbers because we're interested in Geometry let's just take a quick look at these numbers through a spatial or a geometric lens right so spatially this number line is a bit strange right we don't we're not taught that it's weird but it is weird because we have an infinite line but somehow it also has an end at zero and it's a singularity beneath which subtraction fails so you know to to really get somewhere you need negative numbers and as you might imagine people hated negative numbers too they really despise them uh and this is mainly because it's not intuitively obvious that you can have minus three goats right it just doesn't make sense so diantus said any negative solution to equation was automatically false livets hated them and they didn't start to be widely used until the mid 19th century which is kind of crazy from our modern perspective now I think they're actually more radical than the irrationals because they changed the spatial interpretation of the number line in a very important way so we now have the origin in the middle of the line and an infinite extent to either side it's symmetrical so we can think of addition and subtraction as translation in a point in this Infinite Space and more interestingly we can interpret the sign flip we get with multiplication by minus one is a rotation around the origin by 180 deges some of the mathematicians here are saying could also be a reflection and that's true but today we're going to pretend it's only a rotation so by so by adding a new kind of number we get a new kind of space actually that allows both translation and a limited form of rotation and the next big discovery which many of you have already guessed was complex numbers so in the 1500s rapael bombelli was trying to deal with an equation of this form and the solution that he had gotten from cardano for this kind of thing was this this algorithm that you see here in both maths code and also closure code and you can see see the problem right away there's a boundary condition where P cubed is greater than Q ^2 after which one needs to take the square root of a negative number and it returns none right so it's no good but bombelli grafted the two components that he was trying to compare here and Visually confirmed that they converge and he was primarily an engineer so he did what any engineer would do he cluded it yeah so he used a placeholder and this placeholder had a special behavior in these situations and he got this from cardano who had invented it but said it was completely useless and he then wrote a book bom belly then wrote a book about how to solve these problems right and and the textual description you see here is from that book except the part with i in it was actually retrofitted in the addition that I screencapped and although I've read these books I'm not recommending any from this period because they predate anything like modern notation and the Expedition all looks like this walls of text with funny drawings but his method worked which did not stop as you can imagine everyone from sincerely hating it and one of the reasons they hated it which is hinted at at the bottom there is it seemed to violate the rules of of mult application it just didn't make sense and it also looks arbitrary and magical because they were still under the influence of the Greeks in their perspective on numbers now all of you already know that I stands for imagin Imaginary but to get a sense of the vibe Dart coined the term imaginary number as an insult to the very idea that such a thing could exist right this is how people felt about these numbers but over the next 250 years because they simplified calculations involving trig they gained ground and by the early 1800s argand and gaus and vessel all independently figured out that their special geometric numbers that encode rotations in a 2d plane which In fairness was a concept that did not exist in bomb Bell's time so we can forgive him for not noticing uh some find this easier uh easier to see if they look at it like this right this illustration shows that with each exponentiation I rotates by 90 degrees and notice how this feels kind of relative to what we saw earlier with the number line where sign flips sign flips cause rotations now that we have two we're kind of able to cut that in half and there's more going on that I can't explain to a general audience in the time I have but in my opinion the move to complex numbers was the biggest jump in in the history of math up to that point to having real geometric objects things that can represent the kind of world that we perceive and uh another important fact about this is that once you get to them you can't really keep pretending that these are numbers in the same sense as you know the number of goats we're we're somewhere else now we have escaped the naturalistic idea of numbers altogether and I think this is inevitable I think without it the gymnast part of our brains would never have a chance so we're caught up to mid 1800s they were what you might call electrifying times right so the study of what we now call electromagnetism was heating up and Commercial applications were becoming very important the internet boom of the time was the telegraph right it came into commercial use by 1840 submarine cables were laid by 1850 how's that for Progress how's that for building right so this allowed rapid communication between continents for the first time to give you some sense of what that meant it used to take two and a half months for a piece of mail to get from London to Sydney this chart shows you various ones but we're not going to linger on it because it's not the main point of this so this period is where electrical engineering began it was in the context of a different kind of information technology the information of telegraphy right and our computers descend directly from the Telegraph and telephone Claud Shannon's Master thesis which is written only about 80 years later laid the blueprint for our digital computers by applying Boolean algebra to analog relays in the telephone system and the people who were working on this stuff at the time were sort of Matha physicists right because they they hadn't divided into two disciplines at this stage all mathematicians were physicist and vice versa at least close to that and the big problem they faced was coming up with a system for calcul involving 3D space including rotations this was especially important for representing the ideas contained in Maxwell's equations which we will look at now so this block that you see on the left there that's what Maxwell actually wrote down and it's a lot you know there's a lot of stuff there and the stuff on the right which is much more concise and actually much more clear if you happen to have learned how to read this particular notation was created by uh somebody called Gibbs and another person called heavyside one of them in the US one of them UK and it's the system that's taught today and even if you can't read it you can recognize how much more concise it is and that it contains basically the same mathematical information means we're winning right we're we're able to communicate more in less space but the notational system that I prefer and that I'm kind of hinting at today captures the same relationship like this so this this is actually even more tur but it does contain all of the relevant information I cannot explain how in the time I have today but but I will link to an explanation with all the details and for this audience I want to instead give a very gental introduction to this notation which is called geometric algebra we're going to start with these Two Fellas so the black and white one is grasson and the other is Clifford grasson was a German High School teacher who invented most of vectric algebra as a side quest while studying title theory in his fair time this guy was a genius unfortunately his writing was as muddy as his ideas were brilliant so his work made almost no impact during his lifetime Clifford was an English mathematician born somewhat later and also an astronomer and he was one of the few to read and understand grassman's work which he combined with Hamilton's querian and he created this system that he called geometric algebra but that many modern speakers call Clifford algebra in his honored unfortunately he died of tuberculosis at 33 so I suspect we'd have standardized on his approach if he'd lived long enough to make the case for it over the following decades and the uh to talk about this system We'll add a couple more objects and operations to our protocol call so now we have something like this right multiplication has trifurcated we have three kinds of multiplication so the dot product the wed wedge product and the geometric product and then we have vectors which I'm calling here K vectors for reasons that we will loop back around to in a couple of minutes so what do we talk about when we talk about vectors they're geometric objects they're not numbers like they're definitely not numbers but they represent a combination of a length and a direction and we'll often call the length a magnitude which is fancy Latin for bigness and we're going to cover this idea in 2D because that's easier so we're gonna start with this right so here you see these two orthogonal basis vectors so here we have two arrows one who's positive extent extends to the right called E1 and one that extends upward called E2 they're both of unit length which is to say of magnitude one note that the written as E1 and E2 not as X and Y well that's because we as programmers when we see ourselves giving individual names to ordered sequences of similar things we start to think maybe there should be an array with indices or something and in that Spirit we're using these numbered terms so you can add them together like this right uh and you can add them adding them together along with some scalar multiple of each allows you to create any Arrow of any length pointing in any angle right it's just linear combinations of these basis vectors and you can also subtract them and subtraction flips the sign of the subtracted one and this is actually very similar to what we saw earlier with the positive and negative number line right you change the direction of the thing you learned all this this is all the same as what you learned in vector algebra at school the dot product also pretty much the same as what you learned at school so so this is a thing that measures the the co extent of these two lines through a through distance and if you use unit vectors that if you normalize to a length of one of the two you get the cosine back out and then we have this guy which is the wedge product right so this guy is for those of you with a lot of linear algebra it's a generalization of another product that you've already seen called the cross product and what this guy does is he returns instead of like the cross product returns a vector this guy returns a b Vector so the bi Vector is this thing you see on the right hand side here which if a vector is a line that goes in a direction for some distance this is an oriented area so it's just a higher Dimension analog to a vector and you can see that one Arrow points to the tail of the other arrow and then there's a circle in the middle the circle represents the direction that you would rotate in order to bring the head of the second arrow to the tail of the ladder right and we use the reason I like these so much compared to other formulations is that if you Ed by vectors to provide uh your representation of torque and angular momentum in the magnetic field your computations are actually much more concise and make more geometric sense which we'll cover more in just a second and then the most important one of these new kinds of multiplication is something called the geometric product which as you see here is just taking the dot product and adding it to the wedge product now that's kind of weird right because one of them is returning a scalar and the other one's returning this funny bi Vector thing but we've actually seen this exact same relationship a few minutes ago and that's in the complex numbers so so it it turns out that the imaginary number I was actually just the unit by Vector all along and what was once kind of an algebraic ghost turns out to be a consequence of the geometry of space now this is another one where I'll have to link to the supporting materials but man the algebraic expansion that proves this is extremely beautiful now I'm going to compare this approach to the approach that we mostly use like if you go and take Vector there are a lot of matricies involved and to me the Matrix approach kind of treats vectors as tuples with Benefits right it's still it's a series of numbers and you have to pick the numbers apart and then you put them into these matrices and then you grind the crank on the side and you get you get the answer but the geometric intuition that you get from doing that is usually pretty poor and it takes a lot of time and work to get students to understand what these matrices mean in contrast using geometric algebra you can if you need a specific rotation uh by an angle here you do something looks exactly like what you would do with a complex number and you can also just rotate by another bi Vector so simple multiplication you can say hey I've got a line that points this way and I want to take the product of this line and that line and you'll get a rotation which is kind of amazing uh as we will see later this this makes a lot of things way easier so moving on from there I will recommend this paper because it can give you the rigorous treatment that you are craving right now that I cannot provide in this short talk so this is called imaginary numbers are not real it's by Gull lenb and Duran these are three physicists who've done loads of work over the last 20 years to popularize GA in their writing it it's everything is very accessible and if you have high school level maths you can you can plow through it so we've been talking about this all in 2D which has has this particular uh set of entities but one of the great strengths about this approach is that as you go up in Dimensions you keep exactly the same operations and you have sort of equivalent objects so we're going to just take a quick look at what the 3D case might look like which is this so we talked about how a bi Vector is what happens when you wedge together two vectors right then you get this area but if you wedge together three of those you get an oriented volume so all the same operations work the same way in three dimensions as they worked in two Dimensions you don't have a lot of new stuff to learn and this is very different from how we normally teach this stuff normally as you go to three dimensions you learn two or three different uh pieces of the toolkit that only ever work in three dimensions like the cross product but here you just keep doing things the same way you were doing them and it continues to work as you go up and this is why we call them K vectors because really what you have is not a vector a bi Vector Tri Vector what you have is a one vector two Vector three Vector four Vector however many Vector that you need and this turns out to be super useful in physics in fact variations on geometric algebra have been reinvented repeatedly over history because the original notation we had was insufficient so p and der algebras are just geometric algebras invented by physicists to solve physical problems without even knowing that Clifford's results had existed and all of this this huge zoo of geometric Concepts that we use in technical mathematics are all representable inside geometric algebra so instead of having to learn like you know 10 different things to do your your basic engineering or physics work you learn one thing and you keep using it so what we can say about geometric algebra is it kind of combines align areas and volumes now there are other things we care about in Geometry that are not there as you can imagine right there are no planes uh for example there are no spheres things like that so there have to be extensions and uh being able to operate in however many dimensions you please is great but you kind of need to add one more thing to get the full magic of the system and unfortunately it is the most subtle and hard to explain thing here so we're going to get extra extra handwavy now so that's metrics right so so this is in our programming language metaphor these are this is a bit like metaprogramming where you say I want an algebra and I want this many dimensions of the AL algebra to square to minus one like B vectors do but I also want some that's squared to either one or zero the more mathematically sophisticated among you be saying oh yeah so if you need a hyperbolic space you could have this and so on and that's exactly it you can you can then represent more different kinds of spaces this way and once you do that you can Source a up a vast variety of the tools that we use for technical mathematics as these little metric versions of geometric algebra so here are some examples now this is not in any sense a complete list but these are some very popular tools that you can get in this way uh and I'll I'll shout out a couple in particular right so the um macowski SpaceTime is super cool for doing physics and a lot of people are using it for that purpose and if you look at the conformal geometric algebra the last one on the list this one is neat because it has his basic objects things like spheres and so if you want a circle you look at the intersection of two spheres and the part where they meet is a circle and there are situations where that is pretty great but for me the one that is most interesting uh for the things I do day in and day out is projective geometric algebra which I use a lot for computer Graphics applications and for that I'm going to recommend this paper and I'll say that that this line of research really kicked off in 2000 in the context of Robotics when people were looking for better ways to uh to handle the geometry of the world inside of a a situated agent and there was a fellow called zelig who wrote a really nice paper I will link to it and that was followed up by theoretical work by a fellow called Charles Gun uh but because of the background of this audience I think the best paper for you if you're interested in this part is this one by dor and deenik uh and these same people have many Fantastic video presentations on YouTube you can find great stuff about this that will go in depth and Deen in particular is a tireless Advocate who has built a fantastic JavaScript playground for this stuff called ganja uh but in the meantime time we're going to do a little bit of ill-advised live coding right [Applause] so okay so we have our friend emac here and we have a little box you'll notice it's closure code sorry for the non list people there's a JavaScript version of this I I will link to as well which you know if you need infix it has it for you uh so so this is one of those metric things where I'm I'm declaring this uh this certain algebra of these dimensions and and this metric and I'm not going to explain what that means at the moment these are kind of throwaway things that are building that box by knowing how to make uh vertices and edges you got some starter state for a couple of things and then this this function here is uh the entire physics engine and and I want to make clear that what I'm about to show you there's nothing underneath right this is just uh this is just a mathematics library that I'm using to do this so I'm going to come down here and I'm going to uncomment this line and and our little friend the Box will start to bounce around as soon as I can get my mouse over there all right right so the reason we can do this with only like three lines of code to account for Gravity hooks law and a damping function is because the entities that we're using in this context know about both direction and rotation and magnitude all at the same time so this is actually pretty cool now those of you who do a lot of physics or Graphics programming probably think well you know 2D it's not that big a deal right I mean so what happens if we change this to a three and we come over here and we do it again oh it's it's a cube now so you'll note a couple of things here I didn't change a single line of code other than the dimensionality that's pretty boss actually normally you'd have to do a bunch of stuff like if you're a graphics programmer you can clap it's okay now I'm going to change but you know what if we wanted four dimensions how about a tesseract on a string right like that's pretty [Applause] cool so I I'll post later I'll post a blog post or something where I go into line by line what's happening here but it it is pretty amazing and the code because it's in this nice lispy language is basically onetoone with the mathematics that we would otherwise use so uh oh I can't get back to my notes I'm trapped in live coding forever let's see which I guess isn't the worst thing that could happen there we go all right so all right so hopefully this tiny taste has been enough to attract your interest we're pretty much out of time but before you go I need to mention David Hennis that's this joyful looking man here in the 1960s he started work on a research program aimed at refactoring the notation used for technical mathematics using geometric algebra and my first exposure to these ideas was in an 80s paper of his that used geometric algebra to explore theong as a lens on understanding direct theory of electrons it was mind-blowing it blew my mind and after after spending some time with it I came to agree with this quote from David Estus right so this is a way that we we can just move everything into a single formalism and simplify everything that we're doing this is a chance we have to refactor things in a way that could reduce by maybe two or three years the time it takes to educate a young physicist and in so doing make more advanced topics accessible to many more people this would I believe result in real progress in The Sciences which is why I care enough to bring this to your attention today and if this talk inspires you to read only one paper I would ask you to read David EST Stan's 2002 or metal lecture in which he makes this case very very well and I'll close with this quote from hen's old Professor Richard fan and a few thank yous uh first I'd like to thank Alex Miller for his tireless efforts organizing one of the best technology conferences in the world for all these years can we yeah and I'd like to thank the organizers of papers we love Zan shout out for for inviting me I'd like to thank my friend heish Todd for telling me over lunch in Berlin a few years ago that an active Community had formed around geometric algebra thus renewing my hopes for the future I'd like to give thanks to my colleagues at next journal for tolerating my eent excentricities and supporting my work including the creation of this talk and lastly and of course thanks to all of you for [Applause] listening"

        "text": "Famously no one has ever struggled with this one. so there are many lenses for this question I'm going to supply one to serve for the duration of this talk I I think we both discover and invent mathematics as we go and the part of what we discover is the nature of our own evolved capabilities and we'll start with geometry which is in my opinion the basis for everything else we have Okay so from this little guy here uh upper right quadrant for you uh we have a half billion year old bug likee Cambrian swimmer and then we have bug eating early mammals and then we have a buge eating prian I mean giving our family tree it's no surprise that our software is full of bugs but we have something else in common which is that we all Survive by moving through 3D space and to move through space you need to be able to plan based on what you're sensing which requires you to emulate the world to make predictions about future States so this is Simone biles one of the greatest gymnasts ever to compete she's showing truly Elite human spatial and thus geometric ability and my contention is that everything we do in technical mathematics the kind we use in engineering and most physics comes from the same evolved capacities allow her to plan and execute that elaborate series of translations and rotations and our ability to turn those physical gifts inward is what has given us sculpture and perspective drawing as well as mathematical geometry and our ability to reason about objects in space LED naturally to our number sense now many animals have been shown to count objects and work with sequences and there seems to be a natural development of pattern matching and interacting with objects in the world most of you know that pigeons and rats can learn to press a lever a certain number of times to get a treat what you might be more surprised to learn is that red Forest ants can count to around 20 and communicate those quantities to other ants and some animals can apply short-term memory to sequences better than most humans this chimp is memorizing these numerical sequences and tapping them out after they're uded this is something at which the average chimp outperforms the average human this brings us to algebra so while numb exists in some extent to in most animals in geometric sense probably exists in all complex life forms algebra is more specifically human it has biological roots in language and deliberation so this is the first paper I'll recommend today even though it has nothing to do with computer science or mathematics it's an especially good followup to the research on bias that you might have seen from kotan and tki and things like thinking fast and slow their claim and I I think they're right is that as a group living species our reason abilities Rose in the context of deliberation which gave rise to persuasion and the skeptical evaluation of claims and this arms race between these facilities reified cause and effect reasoning into a conscious reflective and linguistic process formal logic and symbolic fluencies seem to be Downstream of this and once we translated the ability to communicate via streams of words and symbols that is to say into art and writing we were able to develop notation at which point we move from biology to culture in our story here today and one of the most successful cultural artifacts of all time is math notation so we might ask what's it for it's both for communication and for thinking you know the Simplicity and Clarity of a good notation not only allows us to serialize our understanding and transmit it to other human beings it also becomes an engine for our own thinking in the context of physics and Engineering we really want that notation to speak as directly as possible to our inner gymnast so that we can bring our deepest evolved powers to bear on whatever problem we're solving as Bertrand Russell puts it here a good notation can be a teacher unto itself you bounce your ideas off of formalism that guide you to a deeper understanding that said if he were alive today I think he'd go further in Champion Machine readable notation that is to say programming language anybody here who has both worked with an Al through an algebraic problem on paper and also used an interactive programming system like for example Mathematica will be able to attest the power of the ladder for improving understanding so I'm going to look at mathematics uh mathematical dotation through a programming language lens throughout the day and this is an eccentric way of doing this and I'm going to anachronistically project back ideas that didn't exist at the Times these things were invented uh and I I'm doing this both because this is a an audience of mostly programmers with varying levels of mathematical ability but also so because I think we do need to apply what we've learned from programming languages in the 20th century so this notation is really it's it's one of our best tools for thought and I don't have time to make the full argument for this and for the need to move to machine readable uh notations here today but I will recommend strongly this paper by susman and wisdom which discusses the work they did creating a scheme based curriculum for classical mechanics if You' prefer it in talk Mo uh talk form check out susman's programming for the expression of ideas and Sam Richie talks about Emy a closure report of susman system which I I hope you all saw at his talk earlier today at this conference so what do we really want for this kind of notation well we want a small number of orthal Primitives it's going to be purely functional because mathematics is it'll have recursive definitions and it'll be lightly objectoriented and I mean that in the sense that it will have generic dispatch of some set of operations over a family of mathematical objects so let's build a protocol for arithmetic in the same order our cultural ancestors did starting with the natural numbers the non- negative integers now I say non- negative but a fun fact about the natural numbers that there's still to this day no agreement as to whether they include zero these are the numbers we use in informal or folk mathematics the ones we share with those Forest ANS we saw earlier they're very tangible and intuitive you can do the first three operations on this slide with any kind of object in the in the natural world division is a bit weird right you either have to accept that the operation returns a tuple of quotient and remainder which initially feels like a type error or you need to invent fractions at which point you have rational numbers but only the positive ones so this would be whole numbers and vulgar fractions right now these are usually uh presented after the integers for set theoretical reasons but we're working today in the order in which these are normally discovered rather than the order in which they're taught so then we have a protocol that looks like this right we've got these four operations we've got these types now the first people we see using this protocol are in ancient Mesopotamia these objects you see here are almost 6,000 years old the thing on the top is called a bulla which is a kind of spherical clay envelope and the smaller things below are stylized representations of trade goods let's say the middle row are Quant tokens yeah so I might put three of them in a bullet and then seal it with a amazing cryptographically secure cylinder seal of people walking to the left as you see here and then later you could drop by my bakery and collect your pastries so this is tangible Computing in an extreme sense right so over time they switched using tokens to make impressions in clay tablets so you could just push the goat token down five times and say well that's five goats and then they move to drawing you know directly on the clay and making tally marks which gets a little better better fun things to note about this piece of History sculpture preceded writing our first forms of writing were about numbers and accounting and credit long precede the invention of money anyway these were very intelligent people so they quickly invented a more abstract numerical notation that looked like this now it's base 60 unlike our base 10 numbers but they had a true place value system like we do not like Roman numerals and 60 is actually a boss way to do this because it has all these factors so if you're living in a world where you're doing everything with fractions as they were it's amazing to be able to factor all of your numbers they even did their uh their division by multiplication of fractions so instead of dividing something by two they would multiply it by 1/2 or as as we put it these days multiplication by reciprocals and to make that fast they had big pre-computed tablets of reciprocals squares cubes uh roots and everything else which we see Engineers doing in our culture as late as the 20th century right up until there were computers so you might ask what did they get up to with all these numbers so I call this tablet a paper I love but it's actually a 4,000 year old old homework assignment right so what's this person doing this young scribe they're solving a problem of area using using Pythagoras Theorem which you'll note is named after someone born 1500 years later and the uniform writing in the middle shows the square root of two to six decimal places they were iteratively approximating irrational numbers in Babylon which is why God struck them down actually so so what were they doing like they developed these tools for surveying initially because they were calculating the areas of parcels and fields which as as an agrarian people you'd expect and they were doing a lot of astronomy because they had a moon-based calendar the way everybody does a lunar calendar and they needed to square it with the solar on so they knew when to plant for the seasons and all that but they went way past what was reasonable for this purpose everything was Surplus to requirements it's pretty clear to me reading these old tablets that the scribal class was composed of the same kind of curious weirdos who invent everything everywhere in every culture they solved quadratic and cubic equations they worked worked with exponential growth and interest rates they even came up with a fourar analysis to compute the ephemeris so they could pick out where the plans would be in the future this is approximately on par with European mathematics 3500 years later so you might wonder why weren't we on the Moon by like a thousand BCE right you know they were prosperous and they were so close to inventing modern technical mathematics to put in perspective we're only about 600 years after European mathematics reached the same point and the answer as it so often is yeah so their agric cultural technology that allowed them to feed their big cities and develop their sophisticated culture was unsustainable the soil grew depleted and salty over time reducing crop yields and then there was an interval of rapid and severe climate change that led to famine and War any resemblance to the current ERA is I'm sure entirely coincidental and no cause for alarm anyway after around 1550 BC there's a dramatic fallof of mathematical tablets all you get are things like this King telling that King that he's going to go kill him if he doesn't give him enough whatever and we don't see very much mathematical progress for about a thousand years this was a long period of relative stagnation The Good the highlights I can give is the Greeks invented basic formal proofs around 600 BC and a couple of people came up with good ways to approximate the area under a curve but otherwise not much was happening and one of the reasons for all of this stagnation was that the Greeks really hated irrational mbers although Babylonians and Egyptians were okay with approximating the square root of two the Greeks thought that they were an Abomination if contemporary counsel to be believed people were murdered in ancient Greece for talking about these numbers which violated closely held philosophical ideas ultimately they wanted Mass to be like the counting with tokens thing that we saw earlier which I contend held them back for quite some time so for the next thousand or so years after that various cultures took turns shepherding the torch of the surviving wisdom of the Ancients the Greeks the Persians Indian mathematicians the House of Wisdom in Baghdad Brahma Gupta and Alaris or as important to what we have today as Dart and gaus but in the interest of time we're just going to skip forward to Italy in the 1800s so by that time our protocol has grown to include a few more types right we have most of the numeric types that we recognize but we still have the same four basic methods over it and uh some of these numbers are a bit weird like the irrationals are odd but if you squinted them long enough you can kind of pretend they're at least the same kind of thing as the natural numbers because we're interested in Geometry let's just take a quick look at these numbers through a spatial or a geometric lens right so spatially this number line is a bit strange right we don't we're not taught that it's weird but it is weird because we have an infinite line but somehow it also has an end at zero and it's a singularity beneath which subtraction fails so you know to to really get somewhere you need negative numbers and as you might imagine people hated negative numbers too they really despise them uh and this is mainly because it's not intuitively obvious that you can have minus three goats right it just doesn't make sense so diantus said any negative solution to equation was automatically false livets hated them and they didn't start to be widely used until the mid 19th century which is kind of crazy from our modern perspective now I think they're actually more radical than the irrationals because they changed the spatial interpretation of the number line in a very important way so we now have the origin in the middle of the line and an infinite extent to either side it's symmetrical so we can think of addition and subtraction as translation in a point in this Infinite Space and more interestingly we can interpret the sign flip we get with multiplication by minus one is a rotation around the origin by 180 deges some of the mathematicians here are saying could also be a reflection and that's true but today we're going to pretend it's only a rotation so by so by adding a new kind of number we get a new kind of space actually that allows both translation and a limited form of rotation and the next big discovery which many of you have already guessed was complex numbers so in the 1500s rapael bombelli was trying to deal with an equation of this form and the solution that he had gotten from cardano for this kind of thing was this this algorithm that you see here in both maths code and also closure code and you can see see the problem right away there's a boundary condition where P cubed is greater than Q ^2 after which one needs to take the square root of a negative number and it returns none right so it's no good but bombelli grafted the two components that he was trying to compare here and Visually confirmed that they converge and he was primarily an engineer so he did what any engineer would do he cluded it yeah so he used a placeholder and this placeholder had a special behavior in these situations and he got this from cardano who had invented it but said it was completely useless and he then wrote a book bom belly then wrote a book about how to solve these problems right and and the textual description you see here is from that book except the part with i in it was actually retrofitted in the addition that I screencapped and although I've read these books I'm not recommending any from this period because they predate anything like modern notation and the Expedition all looks like this walls of text with funny drawings but his method worked which did not stop as you can imagine everyone from sincerely hating it and one of the reasons they hated it which is hinted at at the bottom there is it seemed to violate the rules of of mult application it just didn't make sense and it also looks arbitrary and magical because they were still under the influence of the Greeks in their perspective on numbers now all of you already know that I stands for imagin Imaginary but to get a sense of the vibe Dart coined the term imaginary number as an insult to the very idea that such a thing could exist right this is how people felt about these numbers but over the next 250 years because they simplified calculations involving trig they gained ground and by the early 1800s argand and gaus and vessel all independently figured out that their special geometric numbers that encode rotations in a 2d plane which In fairness was a concept that did not exist in bomb Bell's time so we can forgive him for not noticing uh some find this easier uh easier to see if they look at it like this right this illustration shows that with each exponentiation I rotates by 90 degrees and notice how this feels kind of relative to what we saw earlier with the number line where sign flips sign flips cause rotations now that we have two we're kind of able to cut that in half and there's more going on that I can't explain to a general audience in the time I have but in my opinion the move to complex numbers was the biggest jump in in the history of math up to that point to having real geometric objects things that can represent the kind of world that we perceive and uh another important fact about this is that once you get to them you can't really keep pretending that these are numbers in the same sense as you know the number of goats we're we're somewhere else now we have escaped the naturalistic idea of numbers altogether and I think this is inevitable I think without it the gymnast part of our brains would never have a chance so we're caught up to mid 1800s they were what you might call electrifying times right so the study of what we now call electromagnetism was heating up and Commercial applications were becoming very important the internet boom of the time was the telegraph right it came into commercial use by 1840 submarine cables were laid by 1850 how's that for Progress how's that for building right so this allowed rapid communication between continents for the first time to give you some sense of what that meant it used to take two and a half months for a piece of mail to get from London to Sydney this chart shows you various ones but we're not going to linger on it because it's not the main point of this so this period is where electrical engineering began it was in the context of a different kind of information technology the information of telegraphy right and our computers descend directly from the Telegraph and telephone Claud Shannon's Master thesis which is written only about 80 years later laid the blueprint for our digital computers by applying Boolean algebra to analog relays in the telephone system and the people who were working on this stuff at the time were sort of Matha physicists right because they they hadn't divided into two disciplines at this stage all mathematicians were physicist and vice versa at least close to that and the big problem they faced was coming up with a system for calcul involving 3D space including rotations this was especially important for representing the ideas contained in Maxwell's equations which we will look at now so this block that you see on the left there that's what Maxwell actually wrote down and it's a lot you know there's a lot of stuff there and the stuff on the right which is much more concise and actually much more clear if you happen to have learned how to read this particular notation was created by uh somebody called Gibbs and another person called heavyside one of them in the US one of them UK and it's the system that's taught today and even if you can't read it you can recognize how much more concise it is and that it contains basically the same mathematical information means we're winning right we're we're able to communicate more in less space but the notational system that I prefer and that I'm kind of hinting at today captures the same relationship like this so this this is actually even more tur but it does contain all of the relevant information I cannot explain how in the time I have today but but I will link to an explanation with all the details and for this audience I want to instead give a very gental introduction to this notation which is called geometric algebra we're going to start with these Two Fellas so the black and white one is grasson and the other is Clifford grasson was a German High School teacher who invented most of vectric algebra as a side quest while studying title theory in his fair time this guy was a genius unfortunately his writing was as muddy as his ideas were brilliant so his work made almost no impact during his lifetime Clifford was an English mathematician born somewhat later and also an astronomer and he was one of the few to read and understand grassman's work which he combined with Hamilton's querian and he created this system that he called geometric algebra but that many modern speakers call Clifford algebra in his honored unfortunately he died of tuberculosis at 33 so I suspect we'd have standardized on his approach if he'd lived long enough to make the case for it over the following decades and the uh to talk about this system We'll add a couple more objects and operations to our protocol call so now we have something like this right multiplication has trifurcated we have three kinds of multiplication so the dot product the wed wedge product and the geometric product and then we have vectors which I'm calling here K vectors for reasons that we will loop back around to in a couple of minutes so what do we talk about when we talk about vectors they're geometric objects they're not numbers like they're definitely not numbers but they represent a combination of a length and a direction and we'll often call the length a magnitude which is fancy Latin for bigness and we're going to cover this idea in 2D because that's easier so we're gonna start with this right so here you see these two orthogonal basis vectors so here we have two arrows one who's positive extent extends to the right called E1 and one that extends upward called E2 they're both of unit length which is to say of magnitude one note that the written as E1 and E2 not as X and Y well that's because we as programmers when we see ourselves giving individual names to ordered sequences of similar things we start to think maybe there should be an array with indices or something and in that Spirit we're using these numbered terms so you can add them together like this right uh and you can add them adding them together along with some scalar multiple of each allows you to create any Arrow of any length pointing in any angle right it's just linear combinations of these basis vectors and you can also subtract them and subtraction flips the sign of the subtracted one and this is actually very similar to what we saw earlier with the positive and negative number line right you change the direction of the thing you learned all this this is all the same as what you learned in vector algebra at school the dot product also pretty much the same as what you learned at school so so this is a thing that measures the the co extent of these two lines through a through distance and if you use unit vectors that if you normalize to a length of one of the two you get the cosine back out and then we have this guy which is the wedge product right so this guy is for those of you with a lot of linear algebra it's a generalization of another product that you've already seen called the cross product and what this guy does is he returns instead of like the cross product returns a vector this guy returns a b Vector so the bi Vector is this thing you see on the right hand side here which if a vector is a line that goes in a direction for some distance this is an oriented area so it's just a higher Dimension analog to a vector and you can see that one Arrow points to the tail of the other arrow and then there's a circle in the middle the circle represents the direction that you would rotate in order to bring the head of the second arrow to the tail of the ladder right and we use the reason I like these so much compared to other formulations is that if you Ed by vectors to provide uh your representation of torque and angular momentum in the magnetic field your computations are actually much more concise and make more geometric sense which we'll cover more in just a second and then the most important one of these new kinds of multiplication is something called the geometric product which as you see here is just taking the dot product and adding it to the wedge product now that's kind of weird right because one of them is returning a scalar and the other one's returning this funny bi Vector thing but we've actually seen this exact same relationship a few minutes ago and that's in the complex numbers so so it it turns out that the imaginary number I was actually just the unit by Vector all along and what was once kind of an algebraic ghost turns out to be a consequence of the geometry of space now this is another one where I'll have to link to the supporting materials but man the algebraic expansion that proves this is extremely beautiful now I'm going to compare this approach to the approach that we mostly use like if you go and take Vector there are a lot of matricies involved and to me the Matrix approach kind of treats vectors as tuples with Benefits right it's still it's a series of numbers and you have to pick the numbers apart and then you put them into these matrices and then you grind the crank on the side and you get you get the answer but the geometric intuition that you get from doing that is usually pretty poor and it takes a lot of time and work to get students to understand what these matrices mean in contrast using geometric algebra you can if you need a specific rotation uh by an angle here you do something looks exactly like what you would do with a complex number and you can also just rotate by another bi Vector so simple multiplication you can say hey I've got a line that points this way and I want to take the product of this line and that line and you'll get a rotation which is kind of amazing uh as we will see later this this makes a lot of things way easier so moving on from there I will recommend this paper because it can give you the rigorous treatment that you are craving right now that I cannot provide in this short talk so this is called imaginary numbers are not real it's by Gull lenb and Duran these are three physicists who've done loads of work over the last 20 years to popularize GA in their writing it it's everything is very accessible and if you have high school level maths you can you can plow through it so we've been talking about this all in 2D which has has this particular uh set of entities but one of the great strengths about this approach is that as you go up in Dimensions you keep exactly the same operations and you have sort of equivalent objects so we're going to just take a quick look at what the 3D case might look like which is this so we talked about how a bi Vector is what happens when you wedge together two vectors right then you get this area but if you wedge together three of those you get an oriented volume so all the same operations work the same way in three dimensions as they worked in two Dimensions you don't have a lot of new stuff to learn and this is very different from how we normally teach this stuff normally as you go to three dimensions you learn two or three different uh pieces of the toolkit that only ever work in three dimensions like the cross product but here you just keep doing things the same way you were doing them and it continues to work as you go up and this is why we call them K vectors because really what you have is not a vector a bi Vector Tri Vector what you have is a one vector two Vector three Vector four Vector however many Vector that you need and this turns out to be super useful in physics in fact variations on geometric algebra have been reinvented repeatedly over history because the original notation we had was insufficient so p and der algebras are just geometric algebras invented by physicists to solve physical problems without even knowing that Clifford's results had existed and all of this this huge zoo of geometric Concepts that we use in technical mathematics are all representable inside geometric algebra so instead of having to learn like you know 10 different things to do your your basic engineering or physics work you learn one thing and you keep using it so what we can say about geometric algebra is it kind of combines align areas and volumes now there are other things we care about in Geometry that are not there as you can imagine right there are no planes uh for example there are no spheres things like that so there have to be extensions and uh being able to operate in however many dimensions you please is great but you kind of need to add one more thing to get the full magic of the system and unfortunately it is the most subtle and hard to explain thing here so we're going to get extra extra handwavy now so that's metrics right so so this is in our programming language metaphor these are this is a bit like metaprogramming where you say I want an algebra and I want this many dimensions of the AL algebra to square to minus one like B vectors do but I also want some that's squared to either one or zero the more mathematically sophisticated among you be saying oh yeah so if you need a hyperbolic space you could have this and so on and that's exactly it you can you can then represent more different kinds of spaces this way and once you do that you can Source a up a vast variety of the tools that we use for technical mathematics as these little metric versions of geometric algebra so here are some examples now this is not in any sense a complete list but these are some very popular tools that you can get in this way uh and I'll I'll shout out a couple in particular right so the um macowski SpaceTime is super cool for doing physics and a lot of people are using it for that purpose and if you look at the conformal geometric algebra the last one on the list this one is neat because it has his basic objects things like spheres and so if you want a circle you look at the intersection of two spheres and the part where they meet is a circle and there are situations where that is pretty great but for me the one that is most interesting uh for the things I do day in and day out is projective geometric algebra which I use a lot for computer Graphics applications and for that I'm going to recommend this paper and I'll say that that this line of research really kicked off in 2000 in the context of Robotics when people were looking for better ways to uh to handle the geometry of the world inside of a a situated agent and there was a fellow called zelig who wrote a really nice paper I will link to it and that was followed up by theoretical work by a fellow called Charles Gun uh but because of the background of this audience I think the best paper for you if you're interested in this part is this one by dor and deenik uh and these same people have many Fantastic video presentations on YouTube you can find great stuff about this that will go in depth and Deen in particular is a tireless Advocate who has built a fantastic JavaScript playground for this stuff called ganja uh but in the meantime time we're going to do a little bit of ill-advised live coding right [Applause] so okay so we have our friend emac here and we have a little box you'll notice it's closure code sorry for the non list people there's a JavaScript version of this I I will link to as well which you know if you need infix it has it for you uh so so this is one of those metric things where I'm I'm declaring this uh this certain algebra of these dimensions and and this metric and I'm not going to explain what that means at the moment these are kind of throwaway things that are building that box by knowing how to make uh vertices and edges you got some starter state for a couple of things and then this this function here is uh the entire physics engine and and I want to make clear that what I'm about to show you there's nothing underneath right this is just uh this is just a mathematics library that I'm using to do this so I'm going to come down here and I'm going to uncomment this line and and our little friend the Box will start to bounce around as soon as I can get my mouse over there all right right so the reason we can do this with only like three lines of code to account for Gravity hooks law and a damping function is because the entities that we're using in this context know about both direction and rotation and magnitude all at the same time so this is actually pretty cool now those of you who do a lot of physics or Graphics programming probably think well you know 2D it's not that big a deal right I mean so what happens if we change this to a three and we come over here and we do it again oh it's it's a cube now so you'll note a couple of things here I didn't change a single line of code other than the dimensionality that's pretty boss actually normally you'd have to do a bunch of stuff like if you're a graphics programmer you can clap it's okay now I'm going to change but you know what if we wanted four dimensions how about a tesseract on a string right like that's pretty [Applause] cool so I I'll post later I'll post a blog post or something where I go into line by line what's happening here but it it is pretty amazing and the code because it's in this nice lispy language is basically onetoone with the mathematics that we would otherwise use so uh oh I can't get back to my notes I'm trapped in live coding forever let's see which I guess isn't the worst thing that could happen there we go all right so all right so hopefully this tiny taste has been enough to attract your interest we're pretty much out of time but before you go I need to mention David Hennis that's this joyful looking man here in the 1960s he started work on a research program aimed at refactoring the notation used for technical mathematics using geometric algebra and my first exposure to these ideas was in an 80s paper of his that used geometric algebra to explore theong as a lens on understanding direct theory of electrons it was mind-blowing it blew my mind and after after spending some time with it I came to agree with this quote from David Estus right so this is a way that we we can just move everything into a single formalism and simplify everything that we're doing this is a chance we have to refactor things in a way that could reduce by maybe two or three years the time it takes to educate a young physicist and in so doing make more advanced topics accessible to many more people this would I believe result in real progress in The Sciences which is why I care enough to bring this to your attention today and if this talk inspires you to read only one paper I would ask you to read David EST Stan's 2002 or metal lecture in which he makes this case very very well and I'll close with this quote from hen's old Professor Richard fan and a few thank yous uh first I'd like to thank Alex Miller for his tireless efforts organizing one of the best technology conferences in the world for all these years can we yeah and I'd like to thank the organizers of papers we love Zan shout out for for inviting me I'd like to thank my friend heish Todd for telling me over lunch in Berlin a few years ago that an active Community had formed around geometric algebra thus renewing my hopes for the future I'd like to give thanks to my colleagues at next journal for tolerating my eent excentricities and supporting my work including the creation of this talk and lastly and of course thanks to all of you for [Applause] listening"

        "text": "and we'll start with geometry which is in my opinion the basis for everything else we have Okay so from this little guy here uh upper right quadrant for you uh we have a half billion year old bug likee Cambrian swimmer and then we have bug eating early mammals and then we have a buge eating prian I mean giving our family tree it's no surprise that our software is full of bugs but we have something else in common which is that we all Survive by moving through 3D space and to move through space you need to be able to plan based on what you're sensing which requires you to emulate the world to make predictions about future States so this is Simone biles one of the greatest gymnasts ever to compete she's showing truly Elite human spatial and thus geometric ability and my contention is that everything we do in technical mathematics the kind we use in engineering and most physics comes from the same evolved capacities allow her to plan and execute that elaborate series of translations and rotations and our ability to turn those physical gifts inward is what has given us sculpture and perspective drawing as well as mathematical geometry and our ability to reason about objects in space LED naturally to our number sense now many animals have been shown to count objects and work with sequences and there seems to be a natural development of pattern matching and interacting with objects in the world most of you know that pigeons and rats can learn to press a lever a certain number of times to get a treat what you might be more surprised to learn is that red Forest ants can count to around 20 and communicate those quantities to other ants and some animals can apply short-term memory to sequences better than most humans this chimp is memorizing these numerical sequences and tapping them out after they're uded this is something at which the average chimp outperforms the average human this brings us to algebra so while numb exists in some extent to in most animals in geometric sense probably exists in all complex life forms algebra is more specifically human it has biological roots in language and deliberation so this is the first paper I'll recommend today even though it has nothing to do with computer science or mathematics it's an especially good followup to the research on bias that you might have seen from kotan and tki and things like thinking fast and slow their claim and I I think they're right is that as a group living species our reason abilities Rose in the context of deliberation which gave rise to persuasion and the skeptical evaluation of claims and this arms race between these facilities reified cause and effect reasoning into a conscious reflective and linguistic process formal logic and symbolic fluencies seem to be Downstream of this and once we translated the ability to communicate via streams of words and symbols that is to say into art and writing we were able to develop notation at which point we move from biology to culture in our story here today and one of the most successful cultural artifacts of all time is math notation so we might ask what's it for it's both for communication and for thinking you know the Simplicity and Clarity of a good notation not only allows us to serialize our understanding and transmit it to other human beings it also becomes an engine for our own thinking in the context of physics and Engineering we really want that notation to speak as directly as possible to our inner gymnast so that we can bring our deepest evolved powers to bear on whatever problem we're solving as Bertrand Russell puts it here a good notation can be a teacher unto itself you bounce your ideas off of formalism that guide you to a deeper understanding that said if he were alive today I think he'd go further in Champion Machine readable notation that is to say programming language anybody here who has both worked with an Al through an algebraic problem on paper and also used an interactive programming system like for example Mathematica will be able to attest the power of the ladder for improving understanding so I'm going to look at mathematics uh mathematical dotation through a programming language lens throughout the day and this is an eccentric way of doing this and I'm going to anachronistically project back ideas that didn't exist at the Times these things were invented uh and I I'm doing this both because this is a an audience of mostly programmers with varying levels of mathematical ability but also so because I think we do need to apply what we've learned from programming languages in the 20th century so this notation is really it's it's one of our best tools for thought and I don't have time to make the full argument for this and for the need to move to machine readable uh notations here today but I will recommend strongly this paper by susman and wisdom which discusses the work they did creating a scheme based curriculum for classical mechanics if You' prefer it in talk Mo uh talk form check out susman's programming for the expression of ideas and Sam Richie talks about Emy a closure report of susman system which I I hope you all saw at his talk earlier today at this conference so what do we really want for this kind of notation well we want a small number of orthal Primitives it's going to be purely functional because mathematics is it'll have recursive definitions and it'll be lightly objectoriented and I mean that in the sense that it will have generic dispatch of some set of operations over a family of mathematical objects so let's build a protocol for arithmetic in the same order our cultural ancestors did starting with the natural numbers the non- negative integers now I say non- negative but a fun fact about the natural numbers that there's still to this day no agreement as to whether they include zero these are the numbers we use in informal or folk mathematics the ones we share with those Forest ANS we saw earlier they're very tangible and intuitive you can do the first three operations on this slide with any kind of object in the in the natural world division is a bit weird right you either have to accept that the operation returns a tuple of quotient and remainder which initially feels like a type error or you need to invent fractions at which point you have rational numbers but only the positive ones so this would be whole numbers and vulgar fractions right now these are usually uh presented after the integers for set theoretical reasons but we're working today in the order in which these are normally discovered rather than the order in which they're taught so then we have a protocol that looks like this right we've got these four operations we've got these types now the first people we see using this protocol are in ancient Mesopotamia these objects you see here are almost 6,000 years old the thing on the top is called a bulla which is a kind of spherical clay envelope and the smaller things below are stylized representations of trade goods let's say the middle row are Quant tokens yeah so I might put three of them in a bullet and then seal it with a amazing cryptographically secure cylinder seal of people walking to the left as you see here and then later you could drop by my bakery and collect your pastries so this is tangible Computing in an extreme sense right so over time they switched using tokens to make impressions in clay tablets so you could just push the goat token down five times and say well that's five goats and then they move to drawing you know directly on the clay and making tally marks which gets a little better better fun things to note about this piece of History sculpture preceded writing our first forms of writing were about numbers and accounting and credit long precede the invention of money anyway these were very intelligent people so they quickly invented a more abstract numerical notation that looked like this now it's base 60 unlike our base 10 numbers but they had a true place value system like we do not like Roman numerals and 60 is actually a boss way to do this because it has all these factors so if you're living in a world where you're doing everything with fractions as they were it's amazing to be able to factor all of your numbers they even did their uh their division by multiplication of fractions so instead of dividing something by two they would multiply it by 1/2 or as as we put it these days multiplication by reciprocals and to make that fast they had big pre-computed tablets of reciprocals squares cubes uh roots and everything else which we see Engineers doing in our culture as late as the 20th century right up until there were computers so you might ask what did they get up to with all these numbers so I call this tablet a paper I love but it's actually a 4,000 year old old homework assignment right so what's this person doing this young scribe they're solving a problem of area using using Pythagoras Theorem which you'll note is named after someone born 1500 years later and the uniform writing in the middle shows the square root of two to six decimal places they were iteratively approximating irrational numbers in Babylon which is why God struck them down actually so so what were they doing like they developed these tools for surveying initially because they were calculating the areas of parcels and fields which as as an agrarian people you'd expect and they were doing a lot of astronomy because they had a moon-based calendar the way everybody does a lunar calendar and they needed to square it with the solar on so they knew when to plant for the seasons and all that but they went way past what was reasonable for this purpose everything was Surplus to requirements it's pretty clear to me reading these old tablets that the scribal class was composed of the same kind of curious weirdos who invent everything everywhere in every culture they solved quadratic and cubic equations they worked worked with exponential growth and interest rates they even came up with a fourar analysis to compute the ephemeris so they could pick out where the plans would be in the future this is approximately on par with European mathematics 3500 years later so you might wonder why weren't we on the Moon by like a thousand BCE right you know they were prosperous and they were so close to inventing modern technical mathematics to put in perspective we're only about 600 years after European mathematics reached the same point and the answer as it so often is yeah so their agric cultural technology that allowed them to feed their big cities and develop their sophisticated culture was unsustainable the soil grew depleted and salty over time reducing crop yields and then there was an interval of rapid and severe climate change that led to famine and War any resemblance to the current ERA is I'm sure entirely coincidental and no cause for alarm anyway after around 1550 BC there's a dramatic fallof of mathematical tablets all you get are things like this King telling that King that he's going to go kill him if he doesn't give him enough whatever and we don't see very much mathematical progress for about a thousand years this was a long period of relative stagnation The Good the highlights I can give is the Greeks invented basic formal proofs around 600 BC and a couple of people came up with good ways to approximate the area under a curve but otherwise not much was happening and one of the reasons for all of this stagnation was that the Greeks really hated irrational mbers although Babylonians and Egyptians were okay with approximating the square root of two the Greeks thought that they were an Abomination if contemporary counsel to be believed people were murdered in ancient Greece for talking about these numbers which violated closely held philosophical ideas ultimately they wanted Mass to be like the counting with tokens thing that we saw earlier which I contend held them back for quite some time so for the next thousand or so years after that various cultures took turns shepherding the torch of the surviving wisdom of the Ancients the Greeks the Persians Indian mathematicians the House of Wisdom in Baghdad Brahma Gupta and Alaris or as important to what we have today as Dart and gaus but in the interest of time we're just going to skip forward to Italy in the 1800s so by that time our protocol has grown to include a few more types right we have most of the numeric types that we recognize but we still have the same four basic methods over it and uh some of these numbers are a bit weird like the irrationals are odd but if you squinted them long enough you can kind of pretend they're at least the same kind of thing as the natural numbers because we're interested in Geometry let's just take a quick look at these numbers through a spatial or a geometric lens right so spatially this number line is a bit strange right we don't we're not taught that it's weird but it is weird because we have an infinite line but somehow it also has an end at zero and it's a singularity beneath which subtraction fails so you know to to really get somewhere you need negative numbers and as you might imagine people hated negative numbers too they really despise them uh and this is mainly because it's not intuitively obvious that you can have minus three goats right it just doesn't make sense so diantus said any negative solution to equation was automatically false livets hated them and they didn't start to be widely used until the mid 19th century which is kind of crazy from our modern perspective now I think they're actually more radical than the irrationals because they changed the spatial interpretation of the number line in a very important way so we now have the origin in the middle of the line and an infinite extent to either side it's symmetrical so we can think of addition and subtraction as translation in a point in this Infinite Space and more interestingly we can interpret the sign flip we get with multiplication by minus one is a rotation around the origin by 180 deges some of the mathematicians here are saying could also be a reflection and that's true but today we're going to pretend it's only a rotation so by so by adding a new kind of number we get a new kind of space actually that allows both translation and a limited form of rotation and the next big discovery which many of you have already guessed was complex numbers so in the 1500s rapael bombelli was trying to deal with an equation of this form and the solution that he had gotten from cardano for this kind of thing was this this algorithm that you see here in both maths code and also closure code and you can see see the problem right away there's a boundary condition where P cubed is greater than Q ^2 after which one needs to take the square root of a negative number and it returns none right so it's no good but bombelli grafted the two components that he was trying to compare here and Visually confirmed that they converge and he was primarily an engineer so he did what any engineer would do he cluded it yeah so he used a placeholder and this placeholder had a special behavior in these situations and he got this from cardano who had invented it but said it was completely useless and he then wrote a book bom belly then wrote a book about how to solve these problems right and and the textual description you see here is from that book except the part with i in it was actually retrofitted in the addition that I screencapped and although I've read these books I'm not recommending any from this period because they predate anything like modern notation and the Expedition all looks like this walls of text with funny drawings but his method worked which did not stop as you can imagine everyone from sincerely hating it and one of the reasons they hated it which is hinted at at the bottom there is it seemed to violate the rules of of mult application it just didn't make sense and it also looks arbitrary and magical because they were still under the influence of the Greeks in their perspective on numbers now all of you already know that I stands for imagin Imaginary but to get a sense of the vibe Dart coined the term imaginary number as an insult to the very idea that such a thing could exist right this is how people felt about these numbers but over the next 250 years because they simplified calculations involving trig they gained ground and by the early 1800s argand and gaus and vessel all independently figured out that their special geometric numbers that encode rotations in a 2d plane which In fairness was a concept that did not exist in bomb Bell's time so we can forgive him for not noticing uh some find this easier uh easier to see if they look at it like this right this illustration shows that with each exponentiation I rotates by 90 degrees and notice how this feels kind of relative to what we saw earlier with the number line where sign flips sign flips cause rotations now that we have two we're kind of able to cut that in half and there's more going on that I can't explain to a general audience in the time I have but in my opinion the move to complex numbers was the biggest jump in in the history of math up to that point to having real geometric objects things that can represent the kind of world that we perceive and uh another important fact about this is that once you get to them you can't really keep pretending that these are numbers in the same sense as you know the number of goats we're we're somewhere else now we have escaped the naturalistic idea of numbers altogether and I think this is inevitable I think without it the gymnast part of our brains would never have a chance so we're caught up to mid 1800s they were what you might call electrifying times right so the study of what we now call electromagnetism was heating up and Commercial applications were becoming very important the internet boom of the time was the telegraph right it came into commercial use by 1840 submarine cables were laid by 1850 how's that for Progress how's that for building right so this allowed rapid communication between continents for the first time to give you some sense of what that meant it used to take two and a half months for a piece of mail to get from London to Sydney this chart shows you various ones but we're not going to linger on it because it's not the main point of this so this period is where electrical engineering began it was in the context of a different kind of information technology the information of telegraphy right and our computers descend directly from the Telegraph and telephone Claud Shannon's Master thesis which is written only about 80 years later laid the blueprint for our digital computers by applying Boolean algebra to analog relays in the telephone system and the people who were working on this stuff at the time were sort of Matha physicists right because they they hadn't divided into two disciplines at this stage all mathematicians were physicist and vice versa at least close to that and the big problem they faced was coming up with a system for calcul involving 3D space including rotations this was especially important for representing the ideas contained in Maxwell's equations which we will look at now so this block that you see on the left there that's what Maxwell actually wrote down and it's a lot you know there's a lot of stuff there and the stuff on the right which is much more concise and actually much more clear if you happen to have learned how to read this particular notation was created by uh somebody called Gibbs and another person called heavyside one of them in the US one of them UK and it's the system that's taught today and even if you can't read it you can recognize how much more concise it is and that it contains basically the same mathematical information means we're winning right we're we're able to communicate more in less space but the notational system that I prefer and that I'm kind of hinting at today captures the same relationship like this so this this is actually even more tur but it does contain all of the relevant information I cannot explain how in the time I have today but but I will link to an explanation with all the details and for this audience I want to instead give a very gental introduction to this notation which is called geometric algebra we're going to start with these Two Fellas so the black and white one is grasson and the other is Clifford grasson was a German High School teacher who invented most of vectric algebra as a side quest while studying title theory in his fair time this guy was a genius unfortunately his writing was as muddy as his ideas were brilliant so his work made almost no impact during his lifetime Clifford was an English mathematician born somewhat later and also an astronomer and he was one of the few to read and understand grassman's work which he combined with Hamilton's querian and he created this system that he called geometric algebra but that many modern speakers call Clifford algebra in his honored unfortunately he died of tuberculosis at 33 so I suspect we'd have standardized on his approach if he'd lived long enough to make the case for it over the following decades and the uh to talk about this system We'll add a couple more objects and operations to our protocol call so now we have something like this right multiplication has trifurcated we have three kinds of multiplication so the dot product the wed wedge product and the geometric product and then we have vectors which I'm calling here K vectors for reasons that we will loop back around to in a couple of minutes so what do we talk about when we talk about vectors they're geometric objects they're not numbers like they're definitely not numbers but they represent a combination of a length and a direction and we'll often call the length a magnitude which is fancy Latin for bigness and we're going to cover this idea in 2D because that's easier so we're gonna start with this right so here you see these two orthogonal basis vectors so here we have two arrows one who's positive extent extends to the right called E1 and one that extends upward called E2 they're both of unit length which is to say of magnitude one note that the written as E1 and E2 not as X and Y well that's because we as programmers when we see ourselves giving individual names to ordered sequences of similar things we start to think maybe there should be an array with indices or something and in that Spirit we're using these numbered terms so you can add them together like this right uh and you can add them adding them together along with some scalar multiple of each allows you to create any Arrow of any length pointing in any angle right it's just linear combinations of these basis vectors and you can also subtract them and subtraction flips the sign of the subtracted one and this is actually very similar to what we saw earlier with the positive and negative number line right you change the direction of the thing you learned all this this is all the same as what you learned in vector algebra at school the dot product also pretty much the same as what you learned at school so so this is a thing that measures the the co extent of these two lines through a through distance and if you use unit vectors that if you normalize to a length of one of the two you get the cosine back out and then we have this guy which is the wedge product right so this guy is for those of you with a lot of linear algebra it's a generalization of another product that you've already seen called the cross product and what this guy does is he returns instead of like the cross product returns a vector this guy returns a b Vector so the bi Vector is this thing you see on the right hand side here which if a vector is a line that goes in a direction for some distance this is an oriented area so it's just a higher Dimension analog to a vector and you can see that one Arrow points to the tail of the other arrow and then there's a circle in the middle the circle represents the direction that you would rotate in order to bring the head of the second arrow to the tail of the ladder right and we use the reason I like these so much compared to other formulations is that if you Ed by vectors to provide uh your representation of torque and angular momentum in the magnetic field your computations are actually much more concise and make more geometric sense which we'll cover more in just a second and then the most important one of these new kinds of multiplication is something called the geometric product which as you see here is just taking the dot product and adding it to the wedge product now that's kind of weird right because one of them is returning a scalar and the other one's returning this funny bi Vector thing but we've actually seen this exact same relationship a few minutes ago and that's in the complex numbers so so it it turns out that the imaginary number I was actually just the unit by Vector all along and what was once kind of an algebraic ghost turns out to be a consequence of the geometry of space now this is another one where I'll have to link to the supporting materials but man the algebraic expansion that proves this is extremely beautiful now I'm going to compare this approach to the approach that we mostly use like if you go and take Vector there are a lot of matricies involved and to me the Matrix approach kind of treats vectors as tuples with Benefits right it's still it's a series of numbers and you have to pick the numbers apart and then you put them into these matrices and then you grind the crank on the side and you get you get the answer but the geometric intuition that you get from doing that is usually pretty poor and it takes a lot of time and work to get students to understand what these matrices mean in contrast using geometric algebra you can if you need a specific rotation uh by an angle here you do something looks exactly like what you would do with a complex number and you can also just rotate by another bi Vector so simple multiplication you can say hey I've got a line that points this way and I want to take the product of this line and that line and you'll get a rotation which is kind of amazing uh as we will see later this this makes a lot of things way easier so moving on from there I will recommend this paper because it can give you the rigorous treatment that you are craving right now that I cannot provide in this short talk so this is called imaginary numbers are not real it's by Gull lenb and Duran these are three physicists who've done loads of work over the last 20 years to popularize GA in their writing it it's everything is very accessible and if you have high school level maths you can you can plow through it so we've been talking about this all in 2D which has has this particular uh set of entities but one of the great strengths about this approach is that as you go up in Dimensions you keep exactly the same operations and you have sort of equivalent objects so we're going to just take a quick look at what the 3D case might look like which is this so we talked about how a bi Vector is what happens when you wedge together two vectors right then you get this area but if you wedge together three of those you get an oriented volume so all the same operations work the same way in three dimensions as they worked in two Dimensions you don't have a lot of new stuff to learn and this is very different from how we normally teach this stuff normally as you go to three dimensions you learn two or three different uh pieces of the toolkit that only ever work in three dimensions like the cross product but here you just keep doing things the same way you were doing them and it continues to work as you go up and this is why we call them K vectors because really what you have is not a vector a bi Vector Tri Vector what you have is a one vector two Vector three Vector four Vector however many Vector that you need and this turns out to be super useful in physics in fact variations on geometric algebra have been reinvented repeatedly over history because the original notation we had was insufficient so p and der algebras are just geometric algebras invented by physicists to solve physical problems without even knowing that Clifford's results had existed and all of this this huge zoo of geometric Concepts that we use in technical mathematics are all representable inside geometric algebra so instead of having to learn like you know 10 different things to do your your basic engineering or physics work you learn one thing and you keep using it so what we can say about geometric algebra is it kind of combines align areas and volumes now there are other things we care about in Geometry that are not there as you can imagine right there are no planes uh for example there are no spheres things like that so there have to be extensions and uh being able to operate in however many dimensions you please is great but you kind of need to add one more thing to get the full magic of the system and unfortunately it is the most subtle and hard to explain thing here so we're going to get extra extra handwavy now so that's metrics right so so this is in our programming language metaphor these are this is a bit like metaprogramming where you say I want an algebra and I want this many dimensions of the AL algebra to square to minus one like B vectors do but I also want some that's squared to either one or zero the more mathematically sophisticated among you be saying oh yeah so if you need a hyperbolic space you could have this and so on and that's exactly it you can you can then represent more different kinds of spaces this way and once you do that you can Source a up a vast variety of the tools that we use for technical mathematics as these little metric versions of geometric algebra so here are some examples now this is not in any sense a complete list but these are some very popular tools that you can get in this way uh and I'll I'll shout out a couple in particular right so the um macowski SpaceTime is super cool for doing physics and a lot of people are using it for that purpose and if you look at the conformal geometric algebra the last one on the list this one is neat because it has his basic objects things like spheres and so if you want a circle you look at the intersection of two spheres and the part where they meet is a circle and there are situations where that is pretty great but for me the one that is most interesting uh for the things I do day in and day out is projective geometric algebra which I use a lot for computer Graphics applications and for that I'm going to recommend this paper and I'll say that that this line of research really kicked off in 2000 in the context of Robotics when people were looking for better ways to uh to handle the geometry of the world inside of a a situated agent and there was a fellow called zelig who wrote a really nice paper I will link to it and that was followed up by theoretical work by a fellow called Charles Gun uh but because of the background of this audience I think the best paper for you if you're interested in this part is this one by dor and deenik uh and these same people have many Fantastic video presentations on YouTube you can find great stuff about this that will go in depth and Deen in particular is a tireless Advocate who has built a fantastic JavaScript playground for this stuff called ganja uh but in the meantime time we're going to do a little bit of ill-advised live coding right [Applause] so okay so we have our friend emac here and we have a little box you'll notice it's closure code sorry for the non list people there's a JavaScript version of this I I will link to as well which you know if you need infix it has it for you uh so so this is one of those metric things where I'm I'm declaring this uh this certain algebra of these dimensions and and this metric and I'm not going to explain what that means at the moment these are kind of throwaway things that are building that box by knowing how to make uh vertices and edges you got some starter state for a couple of things and then this this function here is uh the entire physics engine and and I want to make clear that what I'm about to show you there's nothing underneath right this is just uh this is just a mathematics library that I'm using to do this so I'm going to come down here and I'm going to uncomment this line and and our little friend the Box will start to bounce around as soon as I can get my mouse over there all right right so the reason we can do this with only like three lines of code to account for Gravity hooks law and a damping function is because the entities that we're using in this context know about both direction and rotation and magnitude all at the same time so this is actually pretty cool now those of you who do a lot of physics or Graphics programming probably think well you know 2D it's not that big a deal right I mean so what happens if we change this to a three and we come over here and we do it again oh it's it's a cube now so you'll note a couple of things here I didn't change a single line of code other than the dimensionality that's pretty boss actually normally you'd have to do a bunch of stuff like if you're a graphics programmer you can clap it's okay now I'm going to change but you know what if we wanted four dimensions how about a tesseract on a string right like that's pretty [Applause] cool so I I'll post later I'll post a blog post or something where I go into line by line what's happening here but it it is pretty amazing and the code because it's in this nice lispy language is basically onetoone with the mathematics that we would otherwise use so uh oh I can't get back to my notes I'm trapped in live coding forever let's see which I guess isn't the worst thing that could happen there we go all right so all right so hopefully this tiny taste has been enough to attract your interest we're pretty much out of time but before you go I need to mention David Hennis that's this joyful looking man here in the 1960s he started work on a research program aimed at refactoring the notation used for technical mathematics using geometric algebra and my first exposure to these ideas was in an 80s paper of his that used geometric algebra to explore theong as a lens on understanding direct theory of electrons it was mind-blowing it blew my mind and after after spending some time with it I came to agree with this quote from David Estus right so this is a way that we we can just move everything into a single formalism and simplify everything that we're doing this is a chance we have to refactor things in a way that could reduce by maybe two or three years the time it takes to educate a young physicist and in so doing make more advanced topics accessible to many more people this would I believe result in real progress in The Sciences which is why I care enough to bring this to your attention today and if this talk inspires you to read only one paper I would ask you to read David EST Stan's 2002 or metal lecture in which he makes this case very very well and I'll close with this quote from hen's old Professor Richard fan and a few thank yous uh first I'd like to thank Alex Miller for his tireless efforts organizing one of the best technology conferences in the world for all these years can we yeah and I'd like to thank the organizers of papers we love Zan shout out for for inviting me I'd like to thank my friend heish Todd for telling me over lunch in Berlin a few years ago that an active Community had formed around geometric algebra thus renewing my hopes for the future I'd like to give thanks to my colleagues at next journal for tolerating my eent excentricities and supporting my work including the creation of this talk and lastly and of course thanks to all of you for [Applause] listening"
