One issue to remember, though, is many people confuse quoting a <i>study</i> with quoting its <i>authors</i>, and thus quoting a study or paper is dismissed as [[Ad Verecundiam]].

When that happens, it's a common fallacy to scream \"[[Ad Verecundiam]]\". // <i>Actually, outright refuting an argument, or more specifically, stating that the conclusion is not true, based on the existence of a logically fallacy in the argument is _itself_ a fallacy, known as [[Ad Logicam]].  It's somewhat related to [[Modus Ponens]]: the conclusion of a sound argument is irrefutably true (otherwise it's not sound), but nothing can be known of the truth of the conclusion of an unsound argument.</i> // Ahem -- you have conflated two completely different things.  Noting a logical fallacy in an argument most certainly does \"outright refute\" the argument -- that's what refutation of arguments is all about.  That it doesn't follow from the invalidity of an argument that its conclusion is false is a different matter altogether.  And it is utterly false that nothing can be known of the truth of the conclusion of an unsound argument -- e.g., we know that the conclusion of an unsound argument that 1 = 2 is in fact false.

Scientific theories must be falsifiable by nature, so unless you have evidence to falsify this theory upon which experts largely agree, I seriously doubt you'll be able to sway anyone to your side - certainly not me.\"  Steve doesn't care that he pointed you at the wrong paper - he probably didn't understand it anyway.

An authority that has proved useful for other issues that we have verified is generally given more weight. In fact, there are music and movie recommendation algorithms that rely on this principle. The more another person's taste tends to match yours (based on review surveys of recommendations), the more weight their opinions are given. Of course, this is aesthetic-related metrics and not \"facts\", so may not be fully comparable to the issues that rage in software engineering.
