In the chorus, wiki editors don’t edit a single page: each editor creates their own version of the page, often out of the materials of previous pages (through a process called “forking”). Clicking on a link to a page on “The Causes of the Cambrian Explosion”, for example, would deliver to you one version of that wiki page, but make you aware of multiple other attempts to explain the same thing, often based on other versions of the same thing."
