When we demonstrated that [[Cee Plus Plus]] semantics precluded making Java-the-environment be sufficiently like Smalltalk, the next choice was [[Objective Cee]], which we extended with a type system and for which we built and delivered to Sun a [[Virtual Machine]].

No, many of them are not flaws in the sense of contradictions or defects; however, they are flaws in that the language did not live up fully to its design goals.

Two dimensions of that goal are relevant to this page: Java-the-environment and Java-the-language. Regarding Java-the-language, the first choice was [[Cee Plus Plus]]. When we demonstrated that [[Cee Plus Plus]] semantics precluded making Java-the-environment be sufficiently like Smalltalk, the next choice was [[Objective Cee]], which we extended with a type system and for which we built and delivered to Sun a [[Virtual Machine]]. That [[Virtual Machine]] became the early [[Java Virtual Machine]]. Java-the-language was syntactic sugar that was semantically equivalent to our extended [[Objective Cee]]. All of this is to say that the complaint that \"Java isn't Smalltalk\" is, in fact, a historically accurate starting point for identifying its design flaws. It is perfectly reasonable, in that context, to also discuss [[Smalltalk Design Flaws]].</i> -- [[Tom Stambaugh]]",
