If you – a \"client\" – want to use this object, you are aware of three operations that it ought to be able to do: tell you its balance, withdraw some money, or deposit some money. That's it. In fact, you don't even get to know that $150 are ensconced within the object. That information is held *privately* within the object, inaccessible to your prying eyes.
