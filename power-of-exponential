Maybe because we’ve been taught to see the world in this way, as lots of random separate objects: Language creates this separation and school reinforces this by emphasizing separate subjects and examining us individually. We are not routinely taught how to “see” systems as children. We are rewarded for remembering and not sharing. For believing that someone else knows what is best for me, usually someone called “an expert” (be it a teacher, a doctor or a fireman)."

The fire broke out on the 4th floor caused by a faulty fridge-freezer. The policy in tower block fires is to compartmentalize the fire: That is to say, confine it to one apartment. A “stay put” policy ensures that residents are not blocking the stairs and other access routes, so ensuring the fire brigade can control the fire. This didn’t work, and an ongoing inquiry is seeking to identify what caused the fire to spread and who is culpable for the losses."

Some scientists have postulated that it is the blanket of CO2 wrapped around the Earth that is protecting us from an ice age!

They take in CO2, give us oxygen to breathe, and store the carbon in their body. As parts break away (eg leaves in autumn), they decompose and create stable soil carbon. Over time, layers build up pressure, compressing carbon and creating fossil fuels: Nature’s safe storage for carbon…and note, renewable, over long time-frames. The issue is that we have been digging them up, and burning them, and releasing the carbon into the atmosphere."

A systems analysis revealed one key variable driving human behavior: the expected time for the danger to reach me. Those higher up the tower believed the experts and waited to be saved. They paid the ultimate price. One resident, a woman on floor 11, decided to take a look for herself. She saw the rate of advance of the fire and knew she had to get out. She put the plugs in her sinks and bath and turned on all the taps. She shut up her flat and encouraged others on her floor to do the same. She saved her own and many other lives.

        "text": "It is the [[accumulation]] of CO2 in the atmosphere which affects temperature, NOT the flow of emissions. Reducing emissions can be one important factor. But, even if we reduced emissions to zero today, the accumulation in the atmosphere would persist unless there was a [[flow out]]! Then there is the question of the [[optimal]] ppm; like our body temperature of 37 degrees, what is the [[ideal]] level of CO2? Some scientists have postulated that it is the blanket of CO2 wrapped around the Earth that is protecting us from an ice age! These differing perspectives on the same system can be exposed and explored using systems thinking to build the [[commitment to action]] we need."
