If you want to inherit from two classes, make two classes - and make them richly, tighly, deeply, romantically coupled.

Possibly wrap them in a larger, outside object if you find that a useful mental trick. [[Police Car]] is two classes - [[Police Car]]::Police and [[Police Car]]::Car, where an instance of Car and Police are constrained to be tied to each other. Treat them mentally as a single class, a single object.

If you want to inherit from two classes, make two classes - and make them richly, tighly, deeply, romantically coupled. And explose each other to the outside world as public get-accessors, rather than forwarding a laundry-list of methods. Possibly wrap them in a larger, outside object if you find that a useful mental trick. [[Police Car]] is two classes - [[Police Car]]::Police and [[Police Car]]::Car, where an instance of Car and Police are constrained to be tied to each other. Treat them mentally as a single class, a single object. Often, you'll find that the coupling is less than you expected, and that the classes are individually functional and useful, and you get a more versatile system than you'd even have gotten with the MI approach.",
