The user-interaction model which we build takes the form of a directed graph describing a state machine model for a given website. The root node in this graph is the main landing page for a given website. Each user click is represented by a directed edge thus setting the website to a new state. The presence of generated network traffic as a result of a user-generated click is a possibility and therefore any network traffic which occurred when the graph state transition occurred is captured and associated with the given edge."
