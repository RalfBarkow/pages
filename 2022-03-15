But the reactions have also made clear that there are hierarchies in who is shown such empathy and solidarity - and who rather not. These hierarchies are an expression of structural and institutional racisms. In this context, the law has an ambivalent role in that it simultaneously (re)produces racist structures and invites people to question and overcome them. Law produces racist hierarchies by formalizing colonial and racist border regimes. "

Thanks to Western resolve and the courage of Russian democrats, that Soviet Empire collapsed without a shot, spawning a democratic Russia, setting free the former Soviet republics and leading to unprecedented arms control agreements with the U.S.\n\nAnd what was America's response? It was to expand the NATO cold-war alliance against Russia and bring it closer to Russia's borders.\""

But the reactions have also made clear that there are hierarchies in who is shown such empathy and solidarity - and who rather not. These hierarchies are an expression of structural and institutional racisms. In this context, the law has an ambivalent role in that it simultaneously (re)produces racist structures and invites people to question and overcome them. Law produces racist hierarchies by formalizing colonial and racist border regimes. "
