      "text": "In his last novel, The Glass Bead Game (1943), Hermann Hesse (1877–1962) regarded the seventeenth-century German philosopher and polymath Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) as one of the the precursors of the Glass Bead Game. The choice was perhaps even more appropriate than Hesse imagined. Both men yearned for utopias in which extraordinary machines would have a central role. The utopias differ. Leibniz’s, unlike Hesse’s, is an intensification and perfection of certain features of his world rather than a radical break with it; and his utopian machine"
