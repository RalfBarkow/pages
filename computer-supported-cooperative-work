Engineers have joined sociologists in wanting to build mechanisms into their systems that will account for the social costs of changing the infrastructural arrangements of working together. Even in the realm of scientific cognition and decision making, the metaphor of scientists as robust problem solvers is now incorporating issues related to such contingent and messy things as disciplinary and professional politics, or the nature, availiability, and rights of access to laboratory materials (Berg, 1996; Star & Ruhleder, 1996)."
