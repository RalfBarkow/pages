Byte serving begins when an HTTP server advertises its willingness to serve partial requests using the Accept-Ranges response header. A client then requests a specific part of a file from the server using the Range request header. If the range is valid, the server sends it to the client with a 206 Partial Content status code and a Content-Range header listing the range sent. If the range is invalid, the server responds with a 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable status code. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_serving wikipedia]"
