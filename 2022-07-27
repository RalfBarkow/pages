Systems are thus referred to as forms, forms as differences, and differences by the mode of operation that leads to the production and maintenance of the difference of system and environment. This is, as might be shown by the relation between operation and time, a quite unclassical way of describing reality. The tradition, from Aristotle to Hegel16, had described time by means of the distinction between being and non-being (i.e., ontologically) and had conceived it (with considerable uncertainties/ambiguities in its formulation) as the unity of being and non-being. For the resolution of this paradox then the concept of movement had served, and in another way also chronometry. But if all this is not to be valid any more: what is valid then?\n"
