Even worse, since one has a communication theory of social phenomena which proves that these phenomena are too complex to be able to order them causally in terms of cause and effect, intention and effect, one also knows that any calculation of one's own observations is futile. This is already true because every communication basically has at least the choice to take a communication or its refusal as a reason for own selections, as we know especially from the observation of escalation dynamics from marital conflicts to warlike conflicts (see Simon 2001). For this reason alone, it is impossible to know whether attention or the refusal of attention has more favorable effects on the repetition or development of a phenomenon."

        "text": "After all, any form of attention is almost inevitably accompanied by not only observing an action and letting it stand on its own, but also by imputing to it a social meaning and, together with this meaning, possibly even an intention aiming at this meaning, which, at the moment they are imputed, already acquire a structure that is repeatable because it captures a situation that provides the respective event with a context and a contour. But can and must this lead to withdrawing attention from the event whose repetition one does not wish to see? Is this already the end of the matter? Does one not thereby engage in a reaction that may be cognitively convincing because it rejects the 'relational offer' of terrorism, but normatively questionable because it refuses not only attention but also rejection?"

        "text": "The more precisely one knows, thanks to communication theory, that relationships and thus also identity attributions to actors are independent of the question whether they are shaped by affirmation or by negation (see especially Watzlawick et al. 1969; Ruesch/Bateson 1987), the more difficult it becomes to structure one's own observations in such a way that their effect can be kept under control. Even worse, since one has a communication theory of social phenomena which proves that these phenomena are too complex to be able to order them causally in terms of cause and effect, intention and effect, one also knows that any calculation of one's own observations is futile. This is already true because every communication basically has at least the choice to take a communication or its refusal as a reason for own selections, as we know especially from the observation of escalation dynamics from marital conflicts to warlike conflicts (see Simon 2001). For this reason alone, it is impossible to know whether attention or the refusal of attention has more favorable effects on the repetition or development of a phenomenon."
