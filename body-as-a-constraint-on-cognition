Sentence comprehension and construal of meaning are achieved through embodied responses and require knowing both the affordances offered by an object and whether they match our sensorimotor capabilities.56–59 Judging the meaning of a sentence is faster and more accurate, for example, if the text meaning is compatible with the body’s biomechanical features."
