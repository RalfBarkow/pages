We are particularly interested in composition flaws at the design, not code level and therefore are currently exploring the nature of these flaws so we can detect them automatically before the composition is performed. Our long-term goal is to identify new kinds of composition flaws before attackers discover and exploit them. As a first step towards this goal we show an analysis of a recent composition flaw discovered in the Google Desktop Search application, a flaw that compromises users’ privacy. We show the principles of this type of flaws and describe our approach to detecting them."
