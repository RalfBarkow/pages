Wow, this thing sure looks weird. \n<p>\nHmmm. 15-20 digital asset uploads means something different than 15-20 \"images\".  This throws a kink in my \"box in a suitcase\" plan ([[Boîte-en-valise]]) with sitemap graphs should assets be demanded of me. But that file format isn't supported (.svg) and the graphs are too complex to efficiently compress. ='( \n<p>\nAh, well. I figure it out a few seconds before the application window closes (phew) and return to this site to log reflections. One small kink in the program, one great leap for [[Agile]] development processes!  \n<p><i>\nBy exploiting a bug in UCLAs college admission portal that allows me to upload my high school dual credit transcripts as a BFA, I interpret New Genres as something a kid could do while speculating on the differences between a vehicle and a medium.\n<p> </i>\n<i>\nBy refactoring my practice quickly through the immediate contexts of a college admissions portal older than my transcripts, I render digital asset libraries functionally obsolete.\n<p></i>\n<i>\nBy uploading AI art to the portal, I make an exciting new vehicle a functional new medium.\n</i><p>\n<i>\nBy submitting a single work for consideration (a [[New Genres Application]] as a New Genre) on a [[Federated Wiki]] development release engine, I reflect upon 12 years of practicing without a license.</i>\n<p><i>\nBy documenting finished work under a [[CC-BY-SA 4.0]] creative commons license, I share and share alike.\n</i><p>\nLater: A friend asks me if it's cheating to submit a site for a college application and then keep changing it. Ya. Probably. Art teaches you to do that. But isn't it more cheating to program New Genres in old standards?\n<p>\nA lively discussion on time-based mediums follows: is a video that begins and ends the same way every time you watch it really \"time based\"? What about a durational performance sustained beyond its representation in the form of a static document? Can't anyone applying to the program link in a website that they could then change? \n<p>\nI question this kind of monolithic posturing. Seems wedded to a historical stance that only makes sense after you're dead. UCLA probably set itself up for this one: if the MFA program really wanted a 'stillborn art' (Kaprow) we'd have been asked to mail in slides. But 'slide' is a gerund, too. "
