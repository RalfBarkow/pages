Its use is limited only by the user's imagination and curiosity. I have already included it in my [[First Step]] and [[Success Oriented]] schemas. While it is useful in capturing pages from the internet, it is not limited to that. It has two ways you can capture, each of which having strengths and weaknesses, but when taken together, will cover most capture and recover efforts. The first is like a camera, taking a picture of what you have included in a user-defined rectangle, the second being a capture of the complete document. The second method captures not only text, but links and images as well. It has an additional feature I haven't used much where you can capture and store sound from your computer sound system and store in a page as a link. There are a host of other features I haven't touched yet, including handwriting recognition, etc. You'll have to try it to find out for yourself. No cost for trial, which is for an adequate period to allow you to decide whether you want to purchase it or not. \nI will probably do so near the end of the trial period. -- [[Donald Noyes]]",
