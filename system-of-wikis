Intrinsic complexity makes it puzzling for many folks. This kind of issue is only just being engaged in the wiki core community, with a view to making wiki a space of vernacular tools for conviviality."

Sorry, I'm not able to easily imagine what the characteristics of a system of wikis might be, built under an #activitypub protocol. That would be quite a thought experiment â€“ worth doing properly I'd say. But I can try to outline the important characteristics of federated wiki imho. Aka 'wiki'."
