This eventually led them to publish open source files for houses. The idea was to allow anyone to modify and improve the designs for different circumstances, and to enable unskilled labor to quickly and inexpensively erect the structural shell of a home.  They called the new design and construction system Wikihouse.\n<p>\nThe Wikihouse project wants to “put the design solutions for building low-cost, low-energy, high-performance homes into the hands of every citizen and business on earth.”  They want to use digital technologies to “make it easier for existing industries to design, invest in, manufacture and assemble better, more sustainable, more affordable homes for more people.”  And they want to “grow a new, distributed housing industry, comprising many citizens, communities and small businesses developing homes and neighborhoods for themselves, reducing our dependence on top-down, debt-heavy mass housing systems.” \n<p>\nThis philosophy for the technology, economics and processes of house-building are given greater elaboration in the [[Wikihouse Design Principles]], which urge participants to “share global, manufacture local”; design to lower thresholds (to reduce the time, cost, skill and energy needed); rely on open standards and open source share-alike licenses; and empower users to repair and modify features of their homes; among other practices.\n<p>\nSince its modest beginnings, Wikihouse has blossomed into a global design community with ___ chapters in ___ countries, each of which works independently of the Wikihouse Foundation.

This eventually led them to publish open source files for houses. The idea was to allow anyone to modify and improve the designs for different circumstances, and to enable unskilled labor to quickly and inexpensively erect the structural shell of a home.  They called the new design and construction system Wikihouse.\n<p>\nThe Wikihouse project wants to “put the design solutions for building low-cost, low-energy, high-performance homes into the hands of every citizen and business on earth.”  They want to use digital technologies to “make it easier for existing industries to design, invest in, manufacture and assemble better, more sustainable, more affordable homes for more people.”  And they want to “grow a new, distributed housing industry, comprising many citizens, communities and small businesses developing homes and neighborhoods for themselves, reducing our dependence on top-down, debt-heavy mass housing systems.” \n"

        "text": "\nIn this very basic sense, the Wikihouse community seeks to [[develop shared purpose & values]]. In classic open-source style, the community shares its ideas, designs and latest innovations so that anyone can use them and build upon them.  The group seeks to [[share knowledge often & widely]] and [[honor transparency in a sphere of trust]]. While Foundation team of seven people takes the initiative in research and development, design development, partnerships, and so forth, the project must also [[assure commoners' consent in decisionmaking]], lest they drift away and simply ignore Wikihouse.\n<p> \nUltimately, however, many participants in the Wikihouse commons have only a casual commitment to other participants or to the Wikihouse principles. This is consistent with many open source projects, which invite deep commitments by people but do not require them.\n<p>\nThere is little need to [[separate Commons & commerce]] in the case of Wikihouse design and construction because the more serious costs for housing are land and physical materials, not design. Wikihouse actively seeks to give away its housing designs and encourage (free) usage of them. This is yet another case of developing greater value through the open sharing of an intangible resource (designs) than through proprietary ownership. In effect, Wikihouse serves to [[relationalize property]] by licensing it with open licenses.\n\nMORE on: \n- [[Direct Capital to Commons Provisioning]]\n- [[Self-Monitor, Mediate & Sanction]]"

They are making property assets to sel.\n<blockquote/>\nAs recounted by Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiHouse html], Wikihouse won a TEDGlobal case prize in 2012, which spurred it to enter into a partnership to build WIkihouses in a favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Other such partnerships were planned, along with efforts to build WikiHouses to assist in disaster relief efforts. \n<p>\nWhile several prototype houses have been built in Scotland, New Zealand, Austria and other countries, the project remains mostly in an experimental, prototype stage.\n<p>\nThere is certainly kind of commons of designers, architects, engineers, and so forth, in developing the WikiHouse organizational and building models. Among communities and users, however, that is apparently more aspirational than real at this point. \n<p>Envisioned plans would indeed seek to [[share the risks of provisioning]], encourage people to [[make & use together]], and use some form of commons-based mutual support such as [[pool & share]], [[pool, cap if necessary & divide up]], or [[cap & mutualize]] in making WikiHouses available to ordinary people.\n<p>\nCertainly the effort will [[rely on distributed structures]], [[produce cosmo-Locally]], and  [[cocreate generative change]]. In its very conception, Wikihouse are a larger scale will [[use convivial tools]]. It remains to be see how it would [[trade with price-sovereignty]], if at all, or [[protect & extend value sovereignty]]."

Other such partnerships were planned, along with efforts to build WikiHouses to assist in disaster relief efforts. \n<p>\nWhile several prototype houses have been built in Scotland, New Zealand, Austria and other countries, the project remains mostly in an experimental, prototype stage.\n<p>\nThere is certainly kind of commons of designers, architects, engineers, and so forth, in developing the WikiHouse organizational and building models. Among communities and users, however, that is apparently more aspirational than real at this point. \n<p>Envisioned plans would indeed seek to [[share the risks of provisioning]], encourage people to [[make & use together]], and use some form of commons-based mutual support such as [[pool & share]], [[pool, cap if necessary & divide up]], or [[cap & mutualize]] in making WikiHouses available to ordinary people.\n<p>\nCertainly the effort will [[rely on distributed structures]], [[produce cosmo-Locally]], and  [[cocreate generative change]].

Wikihouse actively seeks to give away its housing designs and encourage (free) usage of them. This is yet another case of developing greater value through the open sharing of an intangible resource (designs) than through proprietary ownership. In effect, Wikihouse serves to [[relationalize property]] by licensing it with open licenses."

Among communities and users, however, that is apparently more aspirational than real at this point. \n<p>Envisioned plans would indeed seek to [[share the risks of provisioning]], encourage people to [[make & use together]], and use some form of commons-based mutual support such as [[pool & share]], [[pool, cap if necessary & divide up]], or [[cap & mutualize]] in making WikiHouses available to ordinary people.\n<p>\nCertainly the effort will [[rely on distributed structures]], [[produce cosmo-Locally]], and  [[cocreate generative change]].
