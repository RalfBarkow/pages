      "text": "This book is highly relevant to the goal of understanding organization. It summarizes and integrates an important body of work, accumulated over decades, aimed at describing and understanding the organization of the vertebrate visual system. Maps and columnar structures are a dominant theme of cortical organization. Due to an important wealth of experimental work on the substrate and in silico the mechanisms by which these structures are organized seem now before our eyes. The riddle of how less than 109 bits of genetic information are able to determine the arrangement of 1014 synaptic connections in ontogenesis is resolved by the demonstration that a relatively simple, genetically determined and controlled repertoire of cellular behavior is sufficient to understand the ontogenesis of regular connection patterns. The fundamental motivation behind hundreds of experimental studies of the ontogenesis of retinotopic connection patterns and also a sizable part of the work on cortical maps (on which this book concentrates) is the hope to elucidate the general mechanisms behind the development of the brain’s wiring patterns. This work has led to very clear-cut conclusions painting a convincing and coherent picture. There is a regrettable reluctance of neurobiology to broadcast such conclusions as the message of fundamental importance that they constitute, so that there is a mission still to be accomplished here. This book is an important step in that direction. It employs the tool of computer simulation to show the validity of the principles that have emerged, to teach them, to develop them further and prepare them for application to novel cases."
