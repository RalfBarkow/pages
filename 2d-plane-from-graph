It is obvious that while an infinite square lattice graph, also known as grid graph or mesh graph, at the large scale, can approximate R2, its geodesic distance will approximate the Manhattan distance instead of the desired Euclidean distance [17]. Thus, it is often assumed that such regular structures must be avoided and some irregular structure must be used instead. However, our construction involves multiple interlacing square lattices, each of which represents a different angle of orientation1, which leads to a geodesic distance that converges to the Euclidean distance, as we will show in Section 2.2."
