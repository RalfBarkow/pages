Within STEM disciplines, women and junior researchers—those who are the primary constituents of our lab—consistently receive less credit for equal work (Rosser, 2004). Our Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action Research (CLEAR) is a feminist marine science laboratory at Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada. Recognizing that the stakes of recognition are high for CLEAR members, we have developed an approach to author order that emphasizes process and equity rather than system and equality. Unlike most other labs, we do not attempt to objectively determine the value of contributions, nor do we reward only labor recognized as ‘intellectual’. Although CLEAR’s approach differs from others’, we take author order seriously as a compromised but dominant scientific structure with which we must contend. That is, rather than attempt to circumvent author order, we stay with the trouble.\n"

      "text": "Author order norms for the biological and animal sciences, where we publish most, understand the first author (what we call the Hot Young Thang), as the most important author in terms of findings, writing, and study design. The last author (The White/Wise Old Man), is the anchor of the paper, and provides the lab, training, and grants. These two positions receive the most credit for the research. Other authors rank between them from most important contributor to least. How is this order best determined?"

The last author (The White/Wise Old Man), is the anchor of the paper, and provides the lab, training, and grants. These two positions receive the most credit for the research. Other authors rank between them from most important contributor to least. How is this order best determined?"
