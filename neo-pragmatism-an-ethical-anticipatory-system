Being embedded in a social structure a desirable future can be anticipated in much the same way as a deciduous tree anticipates the future coming of winter by dropping its leaves and conserving its lifeblood during the cold that will soon come.

We are free to say: this is the condition that we have been in, and this is the condition that we predict to be our future. The ethical system that has been called “neo-pragmatism” is an anticipatory system that is ethical in nature in that it allows us to make predictions about how we will probably act in the future.  Since the fundamental nature of neo-pragmatism is the justification of our utterances and our past or proposed actions to a contingent world we can resolve the problem of the double bind and find a solution to Hume's is/ought question.

        "text": "That being said those that discuss the relationship between ethics and future studies concern foresighting. Masini (2006) points out that the grounding of Future Studies, or foresighting has become linked to a philosophical basis and philosophic principles to guide the making of choices, but this view is not adequate. Choices concerning a preferable future should be based upon what is “best” and not what will merely benefit a particular individual or group.  Poli (2011) says that at least three applications of ethics exist in relation to future studies: (a) as a deontological (Kantian) discipline governing the relationship of the futurist and her client; (b) as values that are a given within a particular futurist exercise; and (c) as the dynamic decision system between the agent and the future (as distinguished from the past). The primary interest in the relationship between ethics and Future Studies is the set of values that anchor a particular forecasting exercise. This last category of Future Studies is of interest here. Davis and Pyper (2015) argue that Actor Network Theory (ANT) is a useful model for scenario analysis that answers some of the shortcomings of Intuitive Logics methodology (IL) by focusing on the liberatory potential of possible futures rather than issues of power and legitimacy.  Rather than relying upon theory considered as “true,” ANT explores the relationship between human and non-human actors  (including modes of thought, memes, and technology) to seek out complex patterns of causality and discover emerging phenomena and structures of power.  Waelbers and Dorstewitz (2013) point out that ANT modeling does not recognize human values or ethical systems as part of the decision- making process and suggest instead the classical pragmatic instrumentalism of John Dewey, which rejects any form of moral universalism while demanding an articulated moral position.  An ethical position applies to the agents’ decision-making process since in any real-world scenario an ethical position is at play every time a decision is taken. \n\n\n"

Bell (2004) exhaustively surveys the field of ethics as applied to Future Studies; a complete discussion of all the strands of ethical thought is obviously beyond the scope of this paper, but to summarize, there are three major theories of contemporary normative ethics: (a) deontological ethics (based upon rules governing actions), (b) consequential ethics (emphasizing the consequences of actions), and (c) virtue ethics (emphasizing the effect of actions upon the moral character of the actor) (Hursthouse, 2013). These three branches are theories of ethics (ideas of the good and bad) in the sense that they are abstracted from a particular use in the exploration of the good and the bad. In this sense deontology, consequentialism, and virtue ethics are epistemological in nature; they all attempt to address the question of how we know what is good and what is bad prior to action. "

Consequentialist decision-making is a forward-looking process: the actor considers the likely consequences of her actions and then chooses the action that will have a good result.  For example, a local government concerned with the amount of pollutants in the air might designate alternate no-drive days based upon the odd or even numbering of the license plate as a way to decrease the number of vehicles on the road, and thereby decreasing the level of emissions (as was done in Mexico City).  However, when this regulation was adopted in Mexico City, many drivers bought a second used vehicle with a license plate number opposite that of their current vehicle. The older vehicles polluted more than the newer vehicles and as a result of the no-drive policy the level of air pollution in Mexico City increased dramatically.   Regulating the days that an automobile can be driven logically would result in a good consequence, the reduction of exhaust pollutants; but in practice the fact that drivers avoid the regulation by purchasing a second older vehicle with a different license number resulted in an undesirable consequence, an net increase of exhaust emissions. A consequential analysis of the ethical question relies on a series of assumptions that are not necessarily accurate and accordingly cannot be said to be robust. "

A person is virtuous if she acts from a well-entrenched character trait that can be considered as virtuous (such as honesty or benevolence). Faced with a condition that requires a decision to be made based on the perception that a person or persons has an immediate need, the virtuous person acting from benevolence will attempt to fill that need (such as providing support to low income families with children). Ironically, as Folbre and Wolf (2013) argue, this well- motivated act can lead to serious fertility decline, ultimately undermining the welfare state itself. "

The Rosen formulation of an anticipatory (predictive) system is opposite to those theories and models of living systems that have generally prevailed. Those systems Rosen has called “reactive” in the sense that the system itself does not cause its present state to change in anticipation of the future, but instead causes its present state to change in reaction to events occurring in the present or the past. Rosen argues that this is so because any reactive system can be shown to simulate the behavior associated with an anticipatory system. Indeed, there are certain systems that are only reactive in their nature; such systems can be said to be error based because when the system does not bring about the desired result it becomes subject to correction. In the language of systems thought it is subject to a negative feedback loop; if the system is operating as expected it may be subject to a positive feedback loop. "

In its adjudicative aspect any ethical system is a feedback loop: feedback is deemed negative when one’s utterances or actions are not considered to be socially normative, or deemed positive when they are. In the extreme of this situation, one might end up prison, whereas in the other case one might be promoted to a leadership role or held up as a positive model.

This is contrasted to other ethical systems that are rule based (deontology), the effect upon the development of character (virtue), or the end result of our actions in an overall sense (consequentialist), none of which are concerned with the relationship that exists between our ideas, utterances, and actions and our practices (our values) over time. Pragmatism itself is not a methodology of adjudication or prediction. It is a methodology of identifying the results of ideas, utterances, and actions; it is a theory of meaning in that it attempts to clarify our thought. It is a theory of truth obtained by measuring the results of our thoughts against our practices and values and determining whether those results equated with our predictions\n"

The difference is subtle, but profound. Classical Pragmatism was primarily concerned with clarifying a hypothesis by testing the practical results of the work. The original inquiry has matured in the late 20th century to an inquiry into the practical aspects of our utterances and actions, more to the point the linguistic justification of our utterances and actions in an environment in constant change. The Neo-Pragmatist view of the contingent nature of existence is core to understanding a deep suspicion of any statement that claims to be “true.” From the pragmatist viewpoint our past or future acts are justified by our individual and collective values in relationship to the physical and social environments that we exist in. Neo-Pragmatic thought is not concerned with ontology or foundations; indeed, from the viewpoint of Neo-Pragmatism, ontology is a notion that ought to have historical interest only, and foundations are unprivileged notions that can only be used to justify one action, at one time, to one audience. \n\n"

        "text": "In summary we can say that Neo-Pragmatic ethics is the process of predicting our future conduct within a system that is contingent and without ontological foundation. \nRorty’s thought (much like Rosen’s) has been met with great controversy: “If one is known by the enemies one makes, then Richard Rorty is, indeed, a well-known man” (Brandom, 2000, p. xiv). Rorty was a prolific thinker and writer; his views are global and controversy has surrounded all of his positions. Of particular relevance to the topic of this paper is his view that normative standards of speech and conduct are based within the specific community that the actor exists in. In other words, there are no universal a priori standards, only those defined by the boundary critique of the community to which the actor belongs (Di Beradino, 2014; Rorty, 1989, 1991). The charge of relativism is that most often leveled against Rorty, and the one that engenders the most controversy (Miller, 2002). (Edmonds, 2007) also defended Rosen against the charge of relativism. "

In order for our actions and utterances to be good they must be in accordance with what a virtuous agent would do; neither rules nor the consequences of our acts are important. It is difficult to imagine a predictive scenario that could be made from virtue ethics, given that both the single person and the group of five persons are worthy of consideration. Perhaps it would serve the virtue of reason if the virtue ethics model predicted that it would be more reasonable to sacrifice the life of one person rather than five. The virtue of care must be considered in the choice to sacrifice one person’s life for the lives of five; it would be nearly impossible to choose between the single person and five persons if a decision based upon virtue is strictly concerned with the wellbeing of all six people. \n"

An ethical system is a model of how we adjudicate our past utterances and actions or how we can predict our future utterances and actions. It is clear that a particular ethical system does not need to be able to adjudicate our past conduct and predict our future conduct and indeed what we can learn from a Deontological System is that our predictive conduct often does not comport with the adjudication of our past conduct. Neo-Pragmatism is based upon an ever-changing environment interacting with our values—not our rules, but our values. Neo-Pragmatism does not place any particular value as privileged and so the greatest good—as argued by consequentialist ethics—is not necessarily the value that will be applied in a particular circumstance, nor will any particular virtue.

Being embedded in a social structure a desirable future can be anticipated in much the same way as a deciduous tree anticipates the future coming of winter by dropping its leaves and conserving its lifeblood during the cold that will soon come. The future is also remarkable in its contingency upon the specific social structure from which it emerges and linked to those needs and hopes. "

As a system of ethics the predictive aspect of Neo-Pragmatism most closely models Rosen’s Anticipatory System theory and can be a useful tool for systems thinkers, sociologists, ethicists and all persons interested in the study of the future and anticipation. The question of “what ought we to do now” must be addressed by future studies and the method by which we decide the “what” is of critical importance to life on this earth and the flourishing of human society.

        "text": "# Introduction \nIn J. M. Coetzee’s novel Waiting for the Barbarians the Magistrate of a small town on the outskirts of civilization invites a representative of the Empire into his town and thereby opens the door to hell.  The Magistrate is a good man who sees it as his ethical duty to welcome a stranger to his town and to be helpful to the stranger in accomplishing his mission. In so doing this good man becomes a party to murder, torture, and genocide. This is the ethical dilemma: how can we act ethically in the moment and be purblind to the evil that we unleash at the same time?  Gregory Bateson identifies this dilemma as a double bind: to do good the Magistrate must accommodate evil. \n"

The core notion of early pragmatic thought is that all ideas, utterances, and actions can only be judged in relationship to our practices and the outcome of those ideas, utterances, and actions. This is contrasted to other ethical systems that are rule based (deontology), the effect upon the development of character (virtue), or the end result of our actions in an overall sense (consequentialist), none of which are concerned with the relationship that exists between our ideas, utterances, and actions and our practices (our values) over time. Pragmatism itself is not a methodology of adjudication or prediction. It is a methodology of identifying the results of ideas, utterances, and actions; it is a theory of meaning in that it attempts to clarify our thought. It is a theory of truth obtained by measuring the results of our thoughts against our practices and values and determining whether those results equated with our predictions\n"

Rorty was a prolific thinker and writer; his views are global and controversy has surrounded all of his positions. Of particular relevance to the topic of this paper is his view that normative standards of speech and conduct are based within the specific community that the actor exists in. In other words, there are no universal a priori standards, only those defined by the boundary critique of the community to which the actor belongs (Di Beradino, 2014; Rorty, 1989, 1991). The charge of relativism is that most often leveled against Rorty, and the one that engenders the most controversy (Miller, 2002). (Edmonds, 2007) also defended Rosen against the charge of relativism. "

        "text": "**Context, Contingency, and Relativism**\n\nAs noted, both Rorty (directly) and Rosen (indirectly) have been accused of “relativism” in the pejorative sense. Rorty (1980) defines relativism as “the belief that every view upon a certain topic, or perhaps about any topic, is as good as every other” (166). In terms of modeling processes Edmonds (2007) explains context as the set of factors that define the scope of a specific model. When a group of models can be clustered so that their scopes are similar a “context” of the group may exist. For the Neo-Pragmatism of Rorty all understanding of any statement of “truth” is necessarily made from within and with reference to a specific context. Said another way, all statements about “truth” are made to be understood by a specific audience at a specific time and under specific circumstances; that is a “context.” All statements purporting to be “the truth” are made though language or through some other medium of communication. It necessarily follows that statements dealing with the question of “what is to be done” are also contextual statements. This is the genesis of the accusation of Rorty’s relativism. \n"

In order for our actions and utterances to be good they must be in accordance with what a virtuous agent would do; neither rules nor the consequences of our acts are important. It is difficult to imagine a predictive scenario that could be made from virtue ethics, given that both the single person and the group of five persons are worthy of consideration. Perhaps it would serve the virtue of reason if the virtue ethics model predicted that it would be more reasonable to sacrifice the life of one person rather than five. The virtue of care must be considered in the choice to sacrifice one person’s life for the lives of five; it would be nearly impossible to choose between the single person and five persons if a decision based upon virtue is strictly concerned with the wellbeing of all six people. \n"

As a system of ethics the predictive aspect of Neo-Pragmatism most closely models Rosen’s Anticipatory System theory and can be a useful tool for systems thinkers, sociologists, ethicists and all persons interested in the study of the future and anticipation. \n"

        "text": "Bell (2004) exhaustively surveys the field of ethics as applied to Future Studies; a complete discussion of all the strands of ethical thought is obviously beyond the scope of this paper, but to summarize, there are three major theories of contemporary normative ethics: (a) deontological ethics (based upon rules governing actions), (b) consequential ethics (emphasizing the consequences of actions), and (c) virtue ethics (emphasizing the effect of actions upon the moral character of the actor) (Hursthouse, 2013). These three branches are theories of ethics (ideas of the good and bad) in the sense that they are abstracted from a particular use in the exploration of the good and the bad. In this sense deontology, consequentialism, and virtue ethics are epistemological in nature; they all attempt to address the question of how we know what is good and what is bad prior to action. "

As May (2014) points out deontological ethics are not concerned with the consequences of taking action in accordance with set rules; good and bad are only referent to following the rules. Actions that have good consequences are bad if those actions violate a rule; for example, appropriating private property is generally considered to be morally wrong even though the property that is appropriated is food for starving children. \n"

Consequentialist decision-making is a forward-looking process: the actor considers the likely consequences of her actions and then chooses the action that will have a good result.  For example, a local government concerned with the amount of pollutants in the air might designate alternate no-drive days based upon the odd or even numbering of the license plate as a way to decrease the number of vehicles on the road, and thereby decreasing the level of emissions (as was done in Mexico City).  However, when this regulation was adopted in Mexico City, many drivers bought a second used vehicle with a license plate number opposite that of their current vehicle. The older vehicles polluted more than the newer vehicles and as a result of the no-drive policy the level of air pollution in Mexico City increased dramatically.   Regulating the days that an automobile can be driven logically would result in a good consequence, the reduction of exhaust pollutants; but in practice the fact that drivers avoid the regulation by purchasing a second older vehicle with a different license number resulted in an undesirable consequence, an net increase of exhaust emissions. A consequential analysis of the ethical question relies on a series of assumptions that are not necessarily accurate and accordingly cannot be said to be robust. "

Accordingly an action is virtuous if performed by a virtuous person. A person is virtuous if she acts from a well-entrenched character trait that can be considered as virtuous (such as honesty or benevolence). Faced with a condition that requires a decision to be made based on the perception that a person or persons has an immediate need, the virtuous person acting from benevolence will attempt to fill that need (such as providing support to low income families with children). Ironically, as Folbre and Wolf (2013) argue, this well- motivated act can lead to serious fertility decline, ultimately undermining the welfare state itself. "

Stated another way this paper is concerned with futures influenced by what Bell (2004) calls “preferrability”; that is, future states that for identifiable and articulable reasons are considered to be preferable over other states."

Choices concerning a preferable future should be based upon what is “best” and not what will merely benefit a particular individual or group.  \n"

The primary interest in the relationship between ethics and Future Studies is the set of values that anchor a particular forecasting exercise. This last category of Future Studies is of interest here. Davis and Pyper (2015) argue that Actor Network Theory (ANT) is a useful model for scenario analysis that answers some of the shortcomings of Intuitive Logics methodology (IL) by focusing on the liberatory potential of possible futures rather than issues of power and legitimacy.  Rather than relying upon theory considered as “true,” ANT explores the relationship between human and non-human actors  (including modes of thought, memes, and technology) to seek out complex patterns of causality and discover emerging phenomena and structures of power.  Waelbers and Dorstewitz (2013) point out that ANT modeling does not recognize human values or ethical systems as part of the decision- making process and suggest instead the classical pragmatic instrumentalism of John Dewey, which rejects any form of moral universalism while demanding an articulated moral position.  An ethical position applies to the agents’ decision-making process since in any real-world scenario an ethical position is at play every time a decision is taken. \n\n\n"
