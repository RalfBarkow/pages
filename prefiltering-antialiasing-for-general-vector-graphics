This work presents a simple and practical technique for the rasterization of general vector graphics with correct prefiltering antialiasing: An appropriate antialiasing filter is applied to a continuous model of a shape, and the result is sampled at each pixel position, producing the rasterized output. The use of this technique can significantly enhance the visual quality of most computer applications.\n"
