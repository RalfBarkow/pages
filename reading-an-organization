While \"[[Reading an organization]]\" evokes understanding organizing as the construction and re-construction of conversational (textual) artefacts, \"rethinking the theory of organizational communication\" indicates that the author is determined to go beyond analytical approaches of organizational communication, and to embark instead in the now much neglected activity of thinking and rethinking. A rapid glimpse at the table of contents also presages that the focal questions enhanced by the \"conversational\" perspective will be examined. Thus, Chapter 4 is announced as the contrasting of \"Images of Organization\", Chapter 5 as the exposition of \"The Instantiated Worldview of Information Theory\", Chapter 6 as a reasoning going \"From Conversation to Text -- To Organization\" and Chapter 7 as an exposition of the \"Variety and the Management of Conversation\".

These include the idea that organizational texts are multiple authored (his emphasis), are immanent, structuring and embodying moral imperatives. Yet, while the works of Giddens and Habermas, which might have been relevant in this context, are relegated (in one sentence) to the unattainble sky of meta-theories, Taylor returns to Chomsky in making a plea for developing a \"grammar of organization\". This grammar, as it emerges here, eventually amounts to another set of well-established views in organizational studies, i.e. that communicational logic is embedded in inter-subjectivity and that human interaction, cumulatively combined, produces organizational texts. I shall spare the reader the listing of appropriate references in organizational literature which have promoted these understandings, but which, again, Taylor seems to have chosen to ignore. Instead, I shall single out a major question which arises in this point of his reasoning."

      "text": "Although attempting to convince the reader that the construction of meaning through communicative action has a \"muddling through\" character, Taylor still seems to stick to a strict structuralist view of meaning construction. Yet, these two purviews have irreconcilable implications. In the first instance, meaning can never be really shared, since it is constantly in the making. Meaning, in \"traditional\" deconstructivism, is always *différé* as Derrida would say. Or, to put it differently, there are always more or less, other or derivative meanings involved in a communicative act than one can express in intentional meaningful utterances. If this is so, then meaning can never be codified, not even on the basis of a grammatology. Moreover, shared meaning, in this view, remains in the realm of the unsoundable, out of explicit reach. Yet, while inducing this sort of comprehension, Taylor also tells us: \"How can we so easily forget that even the little word *[[I]]* is part of a paradigm, in that its meaning only takes shape in the context of a contrasting relation to *[[we]]*, and you, and he, and she, and it, and they ?\" (p. 145)."

      "text": "It is thus very difficult to appreciate Taylor's further elaboration which ties speech act, intentionality and representation to the communicative act now wrapped up into a \"Semantic Theory of Narrative Structures\". For, on the one hand, we come across statements like, \"... the explicit content of a statement is always elliptical, and subject to interpretation. Even the manifest sense of a statement may involve clarification, or negotiation\" (p. 195). And, on the other, we find statements like \"The deep structural relations posited in previous chapters turn up in the surface structure of conversation. Conversation effectively expresses our hypothesised deep structural relationships\" (p. 209). So, since this ambiguity is not removed, his understanding of the role of narratives in organizing become itself ambiguous. In one passage, we are told, \"To read an intention, we are claiming, people must transform conversation into a story.... They are able to represent conversation-as-action\" (p. 196) and here we can suspect that the meaning of the story is still \"elliptical\", at least in some parts. On another occasion we are exhorted to adopt the author's view according to which \"... we believe that the narrative framework is the interpretative instrument used by people to decode communication...\" (p. 200) and this time it is clearly indicated that the narrative structure is the interpretative code. Further, it can also be noted that Taylor once again prefers to discard all organizational literature that has worked with a narrative approach to organizing."

      "text": "Although this could perhaps be helpful, I shall not embark here on a study of the numerous and meticulous argumentations pursued by Taylor in arriving at his conception of \"organization as exchange\" (p. 210), which is founded upon his conviction that \"All conversation have as their background a pattern of exchange\" (p. 210). Instead I shall comment briefly on what seems to be his final view. This appears in Chapter 7 and deals with \"the management of conversation\". Taylor states here that \"Communication is not a sender-receiver system; communication is achieved only through the active collaboration of both partners to the exchange: such collaboration implies complementary giving and taking. Communication is controlled as much by the receiver as by the sender\" (p. 226). First of all, let us note the idealistic tone implicit in this view. As Lyotard once argued in polemic against Habermas, there is nothing in the world to insure that people who involve themselves in a conversation do so by first accepting a set of biding prerequisites such as that of being \"partners\", of willing to \"exchange\" anything at all and of acting in a spirit of \"complementarity\". Second, let us also note that this view does not allow for the distinction between verbal and written modes of communication. While his understanding may certainly apply in ideal communicative action by way of speech, it certainly does not apply to communication via written texts, if the work of Derrida on this issue has any significance at all. Finally, Taylor does not seem to pay attention to what it means to communicate when people are consciously communicating. Again, as Derrida pointed out, the term \"communication\" already communicates and this is by no mean deeply structural."

      "text": "I shall not comment upon the last chapter which deals with the reconsideration of organizational research, since it simply pursues the ideas presented earlier in the book. But when I consider this book once I have closed it, I am left with an uncanny feeling. While bearing witness to a great scholarship and introducing some seductive ideas, it is at the same time poorly informed on certain issues and disappointing as far as the expectations it raises are concerned. Although the book does have a strong element of \"rediscovering of the wheel\", it still offers a number of clarifications and insights, as well as a remarkable line of reasoning, which are all extremely valuable. This incompatibility may be due to the fact that rather than acknowledging the contextual view (which, incidently, he stresses is an inextricable dimension of sense-making) which implies that there are no privileged perspectives in organizational studies, Taylor is determined to grant this dignity to communication. He sees communication not as a \"derivative\" or a \"multidisciplinary\" science, but as a \"foundational\" one. \"People are people\", he says \"because they communicate; it is in communication that they become people\" (p. 113). It is perhaps this over-determination which deprives this work of its possible strengths. Parmenides, Heraclitus, Descartes, Heidegger all used to say that \"people are people\" because they think. Being (human) is thinking. Do we really have to choose, except, precisely, in certain contexts?"

Yet, while the works of Giddens and Habermas, which might have been relevant in this context, are relegated (in one sentence) to the unattainble sky of meta-theories, Taylor returns to Chomsky in making a plea for developing a \"grammar of organization\". This grammar, as it emerges here, eventually amounts to another set of well-established views in organizational studies, i.e. that communicational logic is embedded in inter-subjectivity and that human interaction, cumulatively combined, produces organizational texts. I shall spare the reader the listing of appropriate references in organizational literature which have promoted these understandings, but which, again, Taylor seems to have chosen to ignore. Instead, I shall single out a major question which arises in this point of his reasoning."

For, on the one hand, we come across statements like, \"... the explicit content of a statement is always elliptical, and subject to interpretation. Even the manifest sense of a statement may involve clarification, or negotiation\" (p. 195). And, on the other, we find statements like \"The deep structural relations posited in previous chapters turn up in the surface structure of conversation. Conversation effectively expresses our hypothesised deep structural relationships\" (p. 209). So, since this ambiguity is not removed, his understanding of the role of narratives in organizing become itself ambiguous. In one passage, we are told, \"To read an intention, we are claiming, people must transform conversation into a story.... They are able to represent conversation-as-action\" (p. 196) and here we can suspect that the meaning of the story is still \"elliptical\", at least in some parts. On another occasion we are exhorted to adopt the author's view according to which \"... we believe that the narrative framework is the interpretative instrument used by people to decode communication...\" (p. 200) and this time it is clearly indicated that the narrative structure is the interpretative code. Further, it can also be noted that Taylor once again prefers to discard all organizational literature that has worked with a narrative approach to organizing."

        "text": "Although this could perhaps be helpful, I shall not embark here on a study of the numerous and meticulous argumentations pursued by Taylor in arriving at his conception of \"organization as exchange\" (p. 210), which is founded upon his conviction that \"All conversation have as their background a pattern of exchange\" (p. 210). Instead I shall comment briefly on what seems to be his final view. This appears in Chapter 7 and deals with \"the management of conversation\". Taylor states here that \"Communication is not a sender-receiver system; communication is achieved only through the active collaboration of both partners to the exchange: such collaboration implies complementary giving and taking. Communication is controlled as much by the receiver as by the sender\" (p. 226). First of all, let us note the idealistic tone implicit in this view. As Lyotard once argued in polemic against Habermas, there is nothing in the world to insure that people who involve themselves in a conversation do so by first accepting a set of biding prerequisites such as that of being \"partners\", of willing to \"exchange\" anything at all and of acting in a spirit of \"complementarity\". Second, let us also note that this view does not allow for the distinction between verbal and written modes of communication. While his understanding may certainly apply in ideal communicative action by way of speech, it certainly does not apply to communication via written texts, if the work of Derrida on this issue has any significance at all. Finally, Taylor does not seem to pay attention to what it means to communicate when people are consciously communicating. Again, as Derrida pointed out, the term \"communication\" already communicates and this is by no mean deeply structural."

This incompatibility may be due to the fact that rather than acknowledging the contextual view (which, incidently, he stresses is an inextricable dimension of sense-making) which implies that there are no privileged perspectives in organizational studies, Taylor is determined to grant this dignity to communication. He sees communication not as a \"derivative\" or a \"multidisciplinary\" science, but as a \"foundational\" one. \"People are people\", he says \"because they communicate; it is in communication that they become people\" (p. 113). It is perhaps this over-determination which deprives this work of its possible strengths. Parmenides, Heraclitus, Descartes, Heidegger all used to say that \"people are people\" because they think. Being (human) is thinking. Do we really have to choose, except, precisely, in certain contexts?"
