With everything what can possibly come up to me, I must consider in the thinking through that I am also equipped with the means which I need absolutely or presumably or if necessary: means for the renewal of used up energies, for the advancement in impassable terrain, for the defense against the unfriendliness of climate and weather, for the protection against reasonable and unreasonable living beings, for the first and second help in case of injury, for the avoidance and treatment of illness, for the accomplishment of boredom, fear and homesickness. Whether a person has just started to go out, or whether he had to go his way already too, 1000, 100 000 years ago: this changes little in what he needs or could have needed, but rather in what he has or can have."
