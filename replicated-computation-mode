The fundamental computation model is based on the replicated computation mode (though I don't think it is fair to say that the old [[Croquet]] was the first to use it), but the Smalltalk version did not have the model-view separation that gives us a lot of benefit. That opened up the possibility of making all different kinds of collaborative applications, not just a 3D environment. In the latest 3D environment, the programming model with behaviors is \"innovated\"; while it has roots in the past ideas (https://croquet.io/blog/april2022/microverse/) and a variation of the Smalltalk version of Croquet had something not very unlike of it: [https://discord.com/channels/694586717247635488/968615641248571422/973303088377102396 discord]."
