At the same time, it remains more obscure than ever what society is, if not the system. This question is dissolved – and again we have a bourgeois motif of thought and bourgeois reflexivity before us – into a relation of time: the system is society in its (capitalist) present, the real society is what comes after the overcoming of the system."
