Just look at how the word \"critic\" is most often used in everyday English; it evokes usually thoughts of \"movie critics\", \"book critics\", \"art critics\". These people write articles and papers finding fault with others' works, and don't expect to enter into debate with the artists over whether they are right or wrong. It's not that your use of the word is </i>incorrect<i>; but again, it carries subtle additional meanings. There is a distinct difference between \"criticizing\" and \"questioning\" or \"debating\" what someone says. In tone, it's the difference between saying \"you're wrong\" and saying \"that's questionable\", or \"you're wrong according to this reasoning...\".

Just look at how the word \"critic\" is most often used in everyday English; it evokes usually thoughts of \"movie critics\", \"book critics\", \"art critics\".

In tone, it's the difference between saying \"you're wrong\" and saying \"that's questionable\", or \"you're wrong according to this reasoning...\".
