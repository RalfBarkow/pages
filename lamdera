The Lamdera compiler is a fork of the Elm compiler which adds some functionality including Lamdera Wire. The elm-pages framework uses this under the hood. The [[BackendTask]] data you define in your elm-pages Route Modules is resolved either at build-time (for pre-rendered routes, resolved when you run elm-pages build), or at request-time (for server-rendered routes). Imagine you have sensitive data that can't be exposed in your client-side app, like an API key to access data. Since BackendTask's are resolved at build-time or request-time (they are NOT resolved on the client-side in the browser), you can safely use these secrets."

      "text": "The secrets you use to resolve that data won't end up on the client-side at all unless you include any sensitive data in your Route Module's Data value. The automatic serialization we get from the Lamdera Compiler gives us this abstraction for free. Before elm-pages v3, the OptimizedDecoder abstraction was used to serialize all data involved in resolve the BackendTask. This would include any secret environment variables that were used along the way, which is why elm-pages v2 had the Secrets API â€“ to ensure that you could use sensitive values without them showing up on the client-side. Thanks to the Lamdera Compiler, we're able to serialize only the final value for your Route Module's Data (not any of the intermediary values), so the user can reason about it more easily and write less code. It also improves performance because we serialize the Data value in a binary format, reducing the transfer size"
