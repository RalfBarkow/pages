Yet to understand its social and cultural impact, one needs to examine also the different narratives that circulate about it. Software’s opacity, in fact, makes it prone to being translated into a plurality of narratives that help people make sense of its functioning and presence. Drawing from the case of Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA, widely considered the first chatbot ever created, this article proposes a theoretical framework based on the concept of ‘biographies of media’ to illuminate the dynamics and implications of software’s discursive life.
