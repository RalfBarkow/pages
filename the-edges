Exotic conventional objects such as –1 and √–1 and ∞ have been studied for hundreds of years.

The three James pattern axioms were initially chosen to shed light upon natural numbers.

The first, [<o>], labeled J, was discovered as a symbolic expression three hundred years ago and then lost in obscurity until now. This volume tells its story. The second, [ ], what we are calling the square unit, is non-numeric yet embedded at the very foundations of the iconic territory defined by the axiomatic belief system."
