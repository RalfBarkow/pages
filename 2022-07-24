How can a research perspective look like that takes the inherent laws of organizations seriously? Luhmann provides some very concrete suggestions for such a research perspective. He ties in with his early contributions to organizational sociology from the sixties and seventies, but supplements them with insights into the closedness of social systems (autopoiesis). The category of decision, with which Luhmann justifies the difference between organizations and other social systems, thereby acquires an essential significance. The scientific system (as an example of a social subsystem) or the circle of friends (as an example of an interaction system) can function without decisions, the World Bank or Greenpeace only become what they are through decisions."

        "text": "The identification of these differences between society and organization leads Niklas Luhmann to the momentous insight that organizations cannot be understood solely in terms of social structures. How can a research perspective look like that takes the inherent laws of organizations seriously? Luhmann provides some very concrete suggestions for such a research perspective. He ties in with his early contributions to organizational sociology from the sixties and seventies, but supplements them with insights into the closedness of social systems (autopoiesis). The category of decision, with which Luhmann justifies the difference between organizations and other social systems, thereby acquires an essential significance. The scientific system (as an example of a social subsystem) or the circle of friends (as an example of an interaction system) can function without decisions, the World Bank or Greenpeace only become what they are through decisions."
