      "text": "However, the meaning of the linguistic means used (if ever there are linguistic means, for at least some so-called \"speech acts\" can be performed non-verbally) may also be different from the content intended to be communicated. One may, in appropriate circumstances, request Peter to do the dishes by just saying, \"Peter ...!\", or one can promise to do the dishes by saying, \"Me!\" One common way of performing speech acts is to use an expression which indicates one speech act, and indeed performs this act, but also performs a further speech act, which is indirect. One may, for instance, say, \"Peter, can you close the window?\", thereby asking Peter whether he will be able to close the window, but also requesting that he does so. Since the request is performed indirectly, by means of (directly) performing a question, it counts as an indirect speech act."

      "text": "An even more indirect way of making such a request would be to say, in Peter's presence in the room with the open window, \"I'm cold.\" The speaker of this request must rely upon Peter's understanding of several items of in-explicit information: that the window is open and is the cause of her being cold, that being cold is an uncomfortable sensation and she wishes it to be taken care of, and that Peter cares to rectify this situation by closing the window. This, of course, depends much on the relationship between the requester and Peterâ€”he might understand the request differently if she were his boss at work than if she were his girlfriend at home. The more presumed information pertaining to the request, the more indirect the speech act may be considered to be."

      "text": "Indirect speech acts are commonly used to reject proposals and to make requests. For example, a speaker asks, \"Would you like to meet me for coffee?\" and another replies, \"I have class.\" The second speaker used an indirect speech act to reject the proposal. This is indirect because the literal meaning of \"I have class\" does not [[logical consequence]] any sort of rejection."

      "text": "This poses a problem for [[linguists]] because it is confusing (on a rather simple approach) to see how the person who made the proposal can understand that his proposal was rejected. Following substantially an account of [[H. P. Grice]], Searle suggests that we are able to derive meaning out of indirect speech acts by means of a cooperative process out of which we are able to derive multiple illocutions; however, the process he proposes does not seem to accurately solve the problem. [[Sociolinguistics]] has studied the social dimensions of conversations. This discipline considers the various contexts in which speech acts occur."

      "text": "In other words, this means that one does not need to say the words apologize, pledge, or praise in order to show they are doing the action. All the examples above show how the actions and indirect words make something happen rather than coming out straightforward with specific words and saying it."
