The white-man's burden is not to make others like himself. As we see the value of the individual, of every individual, so we must see the **value of each nation**, that all are needed. The pacifists have wanted us to tolerate our enemies and the more extreme ones to turn the other cheek when smitten. But **tolerance is intolerable**. And **we cannot dwell among enemies**. The ideal of this planet inhabited by Christian enemies all turning the cheek does not seem to me a happy one. We must indeed, as the extreme militarists tell us, \"wipe out\" our enemies, but we do not wipe out our enemies by crushing them.

Workingmen have tried to break down international barriers by assuming that their interests were so identical that they could unite across these barriers. But this has failed to bring peace as the other _rapprochements_ have failed. Why? Because they are **all on the wrong track**. International peace is never coming by an increase of similarities (this is the old-fashioned crowd-philosophy); **international peace is coming by the frankest and fullest kind of recognition of our differences**.

      "text": "  Perhaps one of the most useful lessons to be learned from the group process is a new definition of patriotism. **Patriotism** must not be herd instinct. Patriotism must be the individual's rational, self-conscious building of his country every moment. **Loyalty** means always to create your group, not to wave a flag over it [1]. We need a patriotism which is not \"following the lead\" but involved in a **process in which all take part**. In the place of sentimental patriotism we want a common purpose, a purpose evolved by the common life, to be used for the common life. Some of our biologists mislead us when they talk of the homogeneity of the herd as the aim of nations. **The nation may be a herd** at present. What we have to do is to **make it a true group**. Internationalism must be based upon group units, not upon herd or crowd units, that is, upon people united not by herd instinct but by **group conviction**. If a nation is a crowd, patriotism is mere hypnotism; if a nation is a true **federal state built up of interlocking and ascending groups**, then patriotism is self-evolved. When you are building up an association or a nation you have to preach loyalty; later it is part of the very substance which has been built.",

It means, in addition to its other meanings, **every nation being responsible to a larger whole**.  It is this new definition of patriotism which America is now learning.  It is this new patriotism which must be taught our children, which we must repeat to one another on our special patriotic day, July 4th, and on every occasion when we meet. This new patriotism looks in, it looks out: we have to learn that we are not wholly patriotic when we are working with all our heart for America merely; we are truly patriotic only when we are working also that America may take her place worthily and helpfully in the world of nations. Nationalism is not my nation for itself or my nation against others or my nation dominating others, but simply **my nation taking its part as \"an equal among equals**.\" ",

There is possible no world-citizenship the ranks of which are to be filled by those who do not care very much for their own country. We have passed through a period when patriotism among cultivated people seemed often to be at a discount -- the ideal was to be \"citizens of the world.\" But we see now that **we can never be \"citizens of the world\" until we learn how to be citizens of America or England or France**.

Peace will come by the group consciousness rising from the national to the international unit. This cannot be done through the imagination alone but needs actual **experiments in world union**, or rather experiments **first in the union of two or more nations**. Men go round lecturing to kind-hearted audiences and say, \"Can you not be loyal to something bigger than a nation?\" And the kind-hearted audiences reply, \"Certainly, we will now, at your very interesting suggestion, be loyal to a league of nations.\" But this is only a wish on their part, its realization can never come by _wishing_ but only by _willing_, and **willing is a process**, you have to put yourself in a certain place from which to will. We must, in other words, try experiments with a league of nations, and out of the actual life of that league will come loyalty to it. We are not ready for the life of the larger group because some teacher of ethics has taught us \"to respect other men's loyalties.\" We are ready for it when our experience has incorporated into every tissue of our thought-life **the knowledge that we need other men's loyalties**. Loyalty, therefore, is not the chickens running back to the coop, also it is not a sentiment which we decide arbitrarily to adopt, it is the outcome of a process, the **process of belonging**.",

When men have felt the need of larger units than nations and have formed \"alliances,\" they have not felt that they belonged to these alliances.  The sense of belonging ended at the British **Empire** or the German Empire. But the reason Germany became one empire and Italy one nation was because an economic union brought it home to the people daily that they were Italians, not Venetians, Germans, not Bavarians. We must feel the international bond exactly as we feel the national bond. Some one in speaking of the difficulties of internationalism has said, \"It is easier to make sacrifices for those whom you know well, your own countrymen, than for strangers.\" But, internationalism has not come when we decide that we are willing to make sacrifices for strangers. This fallacy has been the stumbling block of some of the pacifists. To make sacrifices for \"strangers\" will never succeed. We make sacrifices for our own nation because of **group feeling**. We shall make sacrifices for a league of nations when we get the same feeling of a bond.",

We belonged for good reasons to a larger unit, but it was only very slowly that we gained any actual feeling of belonging to the United States, of **loving it because we were a constituent part** of it, because we were helping to make it, not just as an external authority to which we had promised loyalty. The American colonies did not undertake to look pleasant and be kind to one another, they **went to work and learned how to live together**.  And state jealousy has been diminished every year, not by any one preaching to us, but by the **process of living together**. This is what may happen in a league of nations.",

      "text": "The great lesson of the group process, in which others are involved, is that particularism, however magnified, is no longer possible. There is **no magic by which selfishness becomes patriotism** the moment we can invoke the nation. The change must be this: as we see now that a nation cannot be healthy and virile if it is **merely protecting the rights of its members**, so we must see that we can have no sound condition of world affairs merely by the protection of each individual nation -- that is the old theory of individual rights. **Each nation must play its part in some larger whole.** Nations have fought for national rights. These are as obsolete as the individual rights of the last century. What raises this war to a place never reached by any war before is that the **Allies are not fighting for national rights.** As long as history is read the contribution of America to the Great War will be told as America's taking her stand squarely and responsibly on the position that **national particularism was in 1917 dead.** And as we are no longer to talk of the \"rights\" of nations, so no longer must \"independent\" nations be the basis of union.  In our present **international law** a **sovereign nation** is one that is independent of other nations -- surely a **complete legal fiction**.  And when stress is laid on **independence** in external relations as the nature of sovereignty, it is but a step to the German idea that independence of others can **develop into authority over others**. This tendency is avoided when we **think of sovereignty: (1) _as looking in_, as authority over its own members, as the independence which is the result of the complete interdependence of those members**; and when we at the same time (2) think of this independence **as _looking out_ to other independences to form through a larger interdependence the larger sovereignty of a larger whole**. **Interdependence is the keynote** of the relations of nations as it is the keynote of the relations of individuals within a nation.  As no man can be entirely free except through his perfected relation to his group, so no nation can be truly independent until a genuine union has brought about interdependence.  As **we no longer think that every individual has a final purpose of his own independent of any community, so we no longer think that each nation has a \"destiny\" independent of the \"destiny\" of other nations**. >> interdependence",

The punishment, however, will not consist in keeping the offender out of the alliance. If the Allies win, Germany should not be punished by keeping her out of a European league; she must be shown how to take her place within it. And it must be remembered that we do not join a league of nations solely to work out our relations to one another, but to learn to work for the larger whole, for **international values**. Until this lesson is learned no league of nations can be successful. >> internationalvalues",

Frenssen said of Jorn Uhl, \"He became conscious of his soul, but **it was empty and he had now to furnish it**.\" We have become conscious of a social soul, we have now to give it content. It is a long way from the maxim, \"Religion is an affair between man and his Maker,\" to the cry of Mazzini, \"Italy is itself a religion,\" but we surely to-day have come to see in the social bond and the Creative Will, a compelling power, a depth and force, as great as that of any religion we have ever known.

It is not coming through any single man, but through the men and men who are banding together with one purpose, in one consecrated service, **for a great fulfillment**. Many of us have felt bewildered in a confused and chaotic world. We need to **focus both our aspirations and our energy**; we need to make these effective and at the same time to **multiply them by their continuous use**.

It is a plea **against everything static**, against the idea that there need be any **passive** material within the social bond.

Patriotism must be the individual's rational, self-conscious building of his country every moment. Loyalty means always to create your group, not to wave a flag over it [1]. We need a patriotism which is not \"following the lead\" but involved in a process in which all take part. In the place of sentimental patriotism we want a common purpose, a purpose evolved by the common life, to be used for the common life. Some of our biologists mislead us when they talk of the homogeneity of the herd as the aim of nations. The nation may be a herd at present. What we have to do is to make it a true group. Internationalism must be based upon group units, not upon herd or crowd units, that is, upon people united not by herd instinct but by group conviction. If a nation is a crowd, patriotism is mere hypnotism; if a nation is a true federal state built up of interlocking and ascending groups, then patriotism is self-evolved. When you are building up an association or a nation you have to preach loyalty; later it is part of the very substance which has been built.",

There is no magic by which selfishness becomes patriotism the moment we can invoke the nation. The change must be this: as we see now that a nation cannot be healthy and virile if it is merely protecting the rights of its members, so we must see that we can have no sound condition of world affairs merely by the protection of each individual nation -- that is the old theory of individual rights. Each nation must play its part in some larger whole. Nations have fought for national rights. These are as obsolete as the individual rights of the last century. What raises this war to a place never reached by any war before is that the Allies are not fighting for national rights. As long as history is read the contribution of America to the Great War will be told as America's taking her stand squarely and responsibly on the position that national particularism was in 1917 dead.     And as we are no longer to talk of the \"rights\" of nations, so no longer must \"independent\" nations be the basis of union.  In our present international law a sovereign nation is one that is independent of other nations -- surely a complete legal fiction.  And when stress is laid on independence in external relations as the nature of sovereignty, it is but a step to the German idea that independence of others can develop into authority over others. This tendency is avoided when we think of sovereignty: (1) _as looking in_, as authority over its own members, as the independence which is the result of the complete interdependence of those members; and when we at the same time (2) think of this independence as _looking out_ to other independences to form through a larger interdependence the larger sovereignty of a larger whole. Interdependence is the keynote of the relations of nations as it is the keynote of the relations of individuals within a nation.  As no man can be entirely free except through his perfected relation to his group, so no nation can be truly independent until a genuine union has brought about interdependence.  As we no longer think that every individual has a final purpose of his own independent of any community, so we no longer think that each nation has a \"destiny\" independent of the \"destiny\" of other nations.",

Patriotism must be the individual's rational, self-conscious building of his country every moment. **Loyalty** means always to create your group, not to wave a flag over it [1]. We need a patriotism which is not \"following the lead\" but involved in a **process in which all take part**. In the place of sentimental patriotism we want a common purpose, a purpose evolved by the common life, to be used for the common life. Some of our biologists mislead us when they talk of the homogeneity of the herd as the aim of nations. **The nation may be a herd** at present. What we have to do is to **make it a true group**. Internationalism must be based upon group units, not upon herd or crowd units, that is, upon people united not by herd instinct but by **group conviction**. If a nation is a crowd, patriotism is mere hypnotism; if a nation is a true **federal state built up of interlocking and ascending groups**, then patriotism is self-evolved. When you are building up an association or a nation you have to preach loyalty; later it is part of the very substance which has been built.",

We must feel the international bond exactly as we feel the national bond. Some one in speaking of the difficulties of internationalism has said, \"It is easier to make sacrifices for those whom you know well, your own countrymen, than for strangers.\" But, internationalism has not come when we decide that we are willing to make sacrifices for strangers. This fallacy has been the stumbling block of some of the pacifists. To make sacrifices for \"strangers\" will never succeed. We make sacrifices for our own nation because of **group feeling**. We shall make sacrifices for a league of nations when we get the same feeling of a bond.",

        "text": "In making a plea for some experiment in international cooperation, I remember, with humiliation, that we have **fought because it is the easy way**. **Fighting solves no problems**. The problems which brought on this war will all be there to be settled when the war ends. But we have war as the line of least resistance. We have war when the mind gives up its **job of agreeing** as too difficult [1]. It is often stated that conflict is a necessity of the human soul, and that if conflict should ever disappear from among us, individuals would deteriorate and society collapse. But the effort of agreeing is so much more strenuous than the comparatively easy stunt of fighting that we can harden our spiritual muscles much more effectively on the former than the latter. Suppose I disagree with you in a discussion and we make no effort to join our ideas, but \"fight it out.\" I hammer away with my idea, I try to find all the weakest parts of yours, I refuse to see anything good in what you think. That is not nearly so difficult as trying to recognize all the possible subtle interweavings of thought, how one part of your thought, or even one aspect of **one part, may unite with one part** or one aspect of one part of mine etc. Likewise with cooperation and competition in business: **cooperation is going to prove so much more difficult than competition** that there is not the slightest danger of any one getting soft under it. >> agreeing",

It has usually been supposed that wars have been the all-important element in consolidating nations; I do not want to disregard this element, I want only to warn against its over emphasis. Moreover, the way in which **wars have had a real and permanent influence in the consolidation** of nations is by the pressure which they have exerted upon them in **showing them that efficiency is obtained by the closest cooperation and coordination of all our activities**, by a high degree of internal organization. >> war_as_catalyst",

We have thought of peace as the lambs lying down together after browsing on the consciousness of their happy agreements. We have thought of peace as a letting go and war as a girding up. **We have thought of peace as the passive and war as the active way of living. The opposite is true.** War is not the most strenuous life. It is a kind of rest-cure compared to the task of reconciling our differences.  I knew a young business man who went to the Spanish war who said when he came back that it had been as good as going to a sanitarium; he had simply obeyed commands and had not made a decision or thought a thought since he left home. From war to peace is not from the strenuous to the easy existence; it is from the futile to the effective, from the stagnant to the active, from the destructive to the creative way of life.",
