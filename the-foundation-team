We shared what we loved, what helped us to flourish and what we lost as learners; who had the greatest impact on us and why; what we valued in our past workplaces and what we’d like to swiftly leave behind. We didn’t know it at the time, but we were naming the culture that we would go on to collaboratively create at Griffin. "
