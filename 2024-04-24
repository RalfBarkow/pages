They cannot be shared with the rest of the development team except through informal, error-prone communication. The inability to share software models is not only a technical problem.

      "text": "Imagine that we have a piece of matter that can change its physical properties like its shape, density, conductivity, or color in a programmable fashion based on either user input or autonomous sensing. This is the vision behind what is commonly known as programmable matter. Envisioning systems of nano-sensors devices, programmable matter consists of systems of simple computational elements, called particles, that can establish and release bonds, compute, and can actively move in a self-organized way. In this dissertation the feasibility of solving fundamental problems relevant for programmable matter is investigated. As a model for such self-organizing particle systems (SOPS), the geometric amoebot model is introduced. In this model, particles only have local information and have modest computational power. They achieve locomotion by expanding and contracting, which resembles the behavior of amoeba. Under this model, efficient local-control algorithms for the leader election problem in SOPS are presented. As a central problem for programmable matter, shape formation problems are then studied. The limitations of solving the leader election problem and the shape formation problem on a more general version of the amoebot model are also discussed. The smart paint\" problem is also studied which aims at having the particles self-organize in order to uniformly coat the surface of an object of arbitrary shape and size, forming multiple coating layers if necessary. A Universal Coating algorithm is presented and shown to be asymptotically worst-case optimal both in terms of time with high probability and work. In particular, the algorithm always terminates within a linear number of rounds with high probability. A linear lower bound on the competitive gap between fully local coating algorithms and coating algorithms that rely on global information is presented, which implies that the proposed algorithm is also optimal in a competitive sense. Simulation results show that the competitive ratio of the proposed algorithm may be better than linear in practice. Developed algorithms utilize only local control, require only constant-size memory particles, and are asymptotically optimal in terms of the total number of particle movements needed to reach the desired shape configuration."

If a particle occupies two nodes (i.e., it is expanded ), it can contract to one of these nodes to occupy only a single node. Performing movements via expansions and contractions has various advantages. For example, it would easily allow a particle to abort a movement if its movement is in conflict with other movements. A particle always knows whether it is contracted or expanded and this information will be available to neighboring particles. For an expanded particle, we denote the node the particle last expanded into as the head of the particle and call the other occupied node its tail. In a handover, two scenarios are possible: a) a contracted particle p can ”[[push]]” a neighboring expanded particle q and expand into the neighboring node previously occupied by q, forcing q to contract, or b) an expanded particle p can ”[[pull]]” a neighboring contracted particle q to a cell occupied by it thereby expanding that particle to that cell, which allows p to contract to its other cell. The ability to use a handover allows the system to stay connected while particles move (e.g., for particles moving in a worm-like fashion). Note that while expansions and contractions may represent the way particles physically move in space, they can also be interpreted as a particle ”looking ahead” and establishing new logical connections (by expanding) before it fully moves to a new position and severs the old connections it had (by contracting)."

It suggests that particles undergo these processes sequentially or interchangeably, highlighting the dynamic nature of their movement. This formulation may be preferable if you want to emphasize the dual nature of particle movement and the importance of both expansion and contraction in the process.\n\n2. **\"Particles move through expansion and contraction\"**: This formulation presents expansion and contraction as a unified process or mechanism of movement. It suggests that particles move through a single process that encompasses both expansion and contraction, rather than treating them as separate or sequential actions. This formulation may be preferable if you want to emphasize the cohesive and interconnected nature of particle movement.\n\nUltimately, the choice between the two formulations depends on the specific context and emphasis of your message. If you want to highlight the individual processes of expansion and contraction, the first formulation may be more suitable. However, if you want to emphasize the unified nature of particle movement, the second formulation may be more appropriate. (ChatGPT 3.5)"

        "text": "Imagine that we have a piece of matter that can change its physical properties like its shape, density, conductivity, or color in a programmable fashion based on either user input or autonomous sensing. This is the vision behind what is commonly known as programmable matter. Envisioning systems of nano-sensors devices, programmable matter consists of systems of simple computational elements, called particles, that can establish and release bonds, compute, and can actively move in a self-organized way. In this dissertation the feasibility of solving fundamental problems relevant for programmable matter is investigated. As a model for such self-organizing particle systems (SOPS), the geometric amoebot model is introduced. In this model, particles only have local information and have modest computational power. They achieve locomotion by expanding and contracting, which resembles the behavior of amoeba. Under this model, efficient local-control algorithms for the leader election problem in SOPS are presented. As a central problem for programmable matter, shape formation problems are then studied. The limitations of solving the leader election problem and the shape formation problem on a more general version of the amoebot model are also discussed. The smart paint\" problem is also studied which aims at having the particles self-organize in order to uniformly coat the surface of an object of arbitrary shape and size, forming multiple coating layers if necessary. A Universal Coating algorithm is presented and shown to be asymptotically worst-case optimal both in terms of time with high probability and work. In particular, the algorithm always terminates within a linear number of rounds with high probability. A linear lower bound on the competitive gap between fully local coating algorithms and coating algorithms that rely on global information is presented, which implies that the proposed algorithm is also optimal in a competitive sense. Simulation results show that the competitive ratio of the proposed algorithm may be better than linear in practice. Developed algorithms utilize only local control, require only constant-size memory particles, and are asymptotically optimal in terms of the total number of particle movements needed to reach the desired shape configuration."

        "text": "Fifth, models obtained through reverse engineering are not recorded. In general, software engineers do not record the models in the software documentation because of time constraints and because the development environment and the documentation environment are not integrated. Software development environments also do not provide a way to record the results of a reverse engineering session. Therefore, the models remain in the heads of the software engineers. They cannot be shared with the rest of the development team except through informal, error-prone communication. The inability to share software models is not only a technical problem. It is also a major management problem because it reduces productivity."

        "text": "If a particle occupies one node (i.e., it is contracted ), it can expand to an unoccupied adjacent node to occupy two nodes. If a particle occupies two nodes (i.e., it is expanded ), it can contract to one of these nodes to occupy only a single node. Performing movements via expansions and contractions has various advantages. For example, it would easily allow a particle to abort a movement if its movement is in conflict with other movements. A particle always knows whether it is contracted or expanded and this information will be available to neighboring particles. For an expanded particle, we denote the node the particle last expanded into as the head of the particle and call the other occupied node its tail. In a handover, two scenarios are possible: a) a contracted particle p can ”[[push]]” a neighboring expanded particle q and expand into the neighboring node previously occupied by q, forcing q to contract, or b) an expanded particle p can ”[[pull]]” a neighboring contracted particle q to a cell occupied by it thereby expanding that particle to that cell, which allows p to contract to its other cell. The ability to use a handover allows the system to stay connected while particles move (e.g., for particles moving in a worm-like fashion). Note that while expansions and contractions may represent the way particles physically move in space, they can also be interpreted as a particle ”looking ahead” and establishing new logical connections (by expanding) before it fully moves to a new position and severs the old connections it had (by contracting)."

It is our reason to exist. Let's push harder on that."
