There are many versions of the Jewish golem legend, but in most of them, a person-like clay statue comes to life after someone writes the word “truth” in Hebrew on its forehead, and eventually starts doing terrible things. The golem stops only when a rabbi erases one of those letters, turning “truth” into the Hebrew word for “death,” and the golem ceases to function."

That is it’s a question of the entity having sentience and free will or not.\n\nAs humans we have the notion of “free will” which alows us to treat any communications in what ever way we chose. However it alows others to come up with the notion of “responsability” and as you walk down that path the determination of good or bad under the current social set of mores and morals, which constantly change.\n\nLanguage be it poetry or codified rules is just information. Entities that are not sentient interpret it via rules that are built in usually by a sentient entity.\n\n\n"

Effectively something on the journy to being a human but not yet there, essentially something unfinished.\n\nWhen you look at the various stories what is essentially missing in the Golem is the sense of “Good or Bad” or societal mores and moarals. It’s “Right or Wrong” determination is based on hard rules not emotions thus uses bivalent not multivalent logic.\n\nThat is there is no “Man made God in his likness” just flow charts. There are no human rights, no merciful justice only the rules. If the rules are wrong and they almost always are, then so are the behaviours which in part are what some of the Golem stories are about.\n\nBut if you take as an example the stories of one religion then you should give equal weight to another.\n\nThe US is not technically a country of religion, there is supposadly clear lines between church and state, and some legislation supporting this.\n\nHowever if you make the mistake of believing what US politicians publically say about themselves, then the US is run by those who believe in the Judeo christian god of the many Abrahanic religions, primarily Anglo-Saxon derived Protestant Christianity based on one of the more modern bibles with it’s new and old testiments (moral stories).\n\nWhen you say,\n\n    “Language does not change the world, except insofar as it persuades, informs, or compels other people.”\n\nThe Bible takes a somewhat different view, most christians can quote some or all of this from Genesis,\n\n    “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.”\n\nFrom which many very firmly believe in “The Word of God” and use of “language”.\n\nMany belive from Hebrews that the word of god has very real corporeal power and the ability to control,\n\n    “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”\n\nAnd strengthend from Jeremiah,\n\n    “’Is not My word like a fire?’ says the Lord, ‘And like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?’”\n\nI could go on and delve into hebrew beliefs about the word of god and how it controls.\n\nOne of the lessons I learned early on is that religion can be a dangerously powerfull driver of humans to do the worst of bestial behaviour through the command of a deity. These days we wrap it up in words like “cognative bias” but in short religion is a form of brainwashing frequently applied to those to young to have any defense against it, thus it is a form of “child abuse”.\n\nWhich is why I avoid using any religious teachings for analogies, and advise most others to do the same, as refrence to “religion” and their deities will always get in the way of the message you are trying to explain.\n\nThe issue by the way is not language, that is at the end of the day just a method of communicating information, that is knowledge, methods, feelings, understanding and yes instructions or rules.\n\nThe actual issue is what the receiving entity of language be it spoken or written choses to do with it. That is it’s a question of the entity having sentience and free will or not.\n\nAs humans we have the notion of “free will” which alows us to treat any communications in what ever way we chose. However it alows others to come up with the notion of “responsability” and as you walk down that path the determination of good or bad under the current social set of mores and morals, which constantly change.\n\nLanguage be it poetry or codified rules is just information. Entities that are not sentient interpret it via rules that are built in usually by a sentient entity.\n\nWhilst DAO’s are language which both communicates and instructs, they are not intended for sentient entities but the “unquestioning obeyant systems” we call computers or even wider autonomous systems such as industrial control systems. We do not expect nor do we want sentience in such systems, we want every state to be fully defined and progression from one state to another fully defined such that the system behaviour is fully determanistic.\n"

Entities that are not sentient interpret it via rules that are built in usually by a sentient entity.\n\nWhilst DAO’s are language which both communicates and instructs, they are not intended for sentient entities but the “unquestioning obeyant systems” we call computers or even wider autonomous systems such as industrial control systems.

There are many versions of the Jewish golem legend, but in most of them, a person-like clay statue comes to life after someone writes the word “truth” in Hebrew on its forehead, and eventually starts doing terrible things. The golem stops only when a rabbi erases one of those letters, turning “truth” into the Hebrew word for “death,” and the golem ceases to function."
