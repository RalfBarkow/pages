Boundaries may exist in space, in time or in abstract concepts.\n\nInformation crossing a boundary between a system and its environment or between a system and its sub or suprasystem must do so by means of a transducer which leads the information across the boundary from the language of the system to the language of the environment. Confusion sometimes arises in complex systems when an activity overlaps different system and sub-system boundaries.\n\nIn many systems, perspectives or conditions may be different depending on how close they are to that system's boundary. In the natural environment, there are many examples of specialized boundary areas which are systems in and of themselves of which the shore line the tree line are perhaps the most familiar. A similar situation applies in an organization where staff members who spend most of their time representing the organization in its external environment will have a very different view from those whose activities are primarily internal. Sales and procurement staff, researchers, planners, and lobbyists have different perspectives from one another and from that held by the front office staff.\n# SOURCE\nthe word boundary refers to a setting of limits originally it applied primarily to territorial boundaries."
