Two-dimensional container configurations express change by [[Animation]]. Three-dimensional block configurations are intended to express change as physical activities. Thus iconic transformation rules can be expressed statically as textual rewrites, dynamically as shifting boundaries, and physically as the reorganization of concrete objects.
