On Earth this includes saturation of the atmosphere by greenhouse gases and production of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe most extensive mass extinction event in the history of Earth, represented by the Permian-Triassic boundary 251 million years-ago, involved acidification, oxygen depletion of the oceans and consequent emanations of toxic H2S and CH4, leading to a loss of some 57% of biological families, 83% of genera and 81% of marine species.\n\nIf the history of the 21st century is ever written it would report that, while large parts of the planet were becoming uninhabitable, the extreme rate and scale of global warming and migration of climate zones (~100 km per decade), the extent of polar ice melting, ocean warming and acidification, and methane release from permafrost, threatened to develop into one of the most extensive mass extinction events in the geological history of planet Earth.\n\nAs concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases exceed 500 ppm CO2-equivalents, consistent with global warming of more than 4oC, climate scientists have been replaced by an army of economists and politicians mostly ignorant of the physics and chemistry of the atmosphere but quantifying the cost-benefit economies of mitigation like corner grocers. Proposed mitigation action were mostly restricted to reduced emissions, neglecting the amplifying climate feedbacks and tipping points projected by leading climate scientists.\n\nDuring the 20th and 21st centuries, with the rise of Fascism and climate change denial, many humans remained preoccupied by brutal wars and propagation of suicidal weapons, entertained by sport circuses, celebrity cults, frivolous showbiz, gratuitous hubris, homicide movies, canned laughter and the share market. While large parts of the planet were becoming uninhabitable, billionaire cowboys kept throwing $billions into space. Small pockets of humanity survived in remote regions of the planet among the wretched of the Earth, strafed by drones by the forces of empires."
