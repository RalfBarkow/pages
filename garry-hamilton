I was very pleasantly surprised to find (at least at Coe Elementary that we chose to attend) that a public school DID seem to provide a very thoughtful and well balanced education. I really want public schools in this country to be not just good, but great! When we moved to Corvallis, OR, I felt that some things slipped. While most of the educators in our school here seem good, there seems to be less unity of curriculum, and during the 2nd grade, my daughter slipped in math.. basically, she learned more advanced stuff in the 1st grade in Seattle and was considered gifted! Anyway, my point is that the public school system seems to vary a lot around the country, or even around a single city. My opinion is that having the money to have enough teachers to keep class sizes low is the single most important thing that would help. -- [[Ron Jandrasi]]",

That hasn't been always the purpose of the teachers, parents, or students (certainly not the students) but with time, and the liberal application of more and more of the psych \"sciences\" we've achieved a system that conditions and indoctrinates more than it educates. The parents and students still resist that model, but the teachers have become (largely) assimilated into the psych-borg. I worked as a consultant with the NEA (National Education Assn) over a four year period, and I can tell you with certainty, they are not your friends. The system is rotten from the top down.

So some of this stuff I reserve for quiet, private conversations. I had an experience with a \"guru\" who allowed me to thrash around for weeks before I finally asked him what to do. The answer was (for him) simple and well known. I asked him indignantly why he let me waste so much time thrashing. His answer was, \"I don't dispense advice or knowledge unless it's asked for.\" I've had a hard time with that lesson, since I keep hoping that certain knowledge will register with some people if I give it freely. I'm nearly always wrong. But I'm always happy to convey what I know to anyone who asks. Sometimes what I know is even useful. And that makes it worthwhile. -- gh",

I don't think it is just me getting older. I can't bear the thought of my kids being so bombarded by valueless crap. Or worse, crap that promotes very poor values. I do think that healthy values can be instilled without being part of a church, though. (at least I hope so)",

Somewhere in that process I stopped being a \"church on Sunday\" guy. For several years \"church\" was what I lived (daily active application of values and the methods to achieve them). Sundays-only people didn't impress me at all. I still don't do Sundays-in-the-pew. But nobody can shake what I know. Something I have always told my kids when asked whether such-and-such was okay is, \"<b>[[Do What You Know Is Right]].</b>\" If they didn't know whether such-and-such was right/wrong, we worked through it from causes and effects, benefits and detriments. It hasn't been perfect, but I <i>never</i> gave them \"just do this; God says so.\" -- gh",

I was very pleasantly surprised to find (at least at Coe Elementary that we chose to attend) that a public school DID seem to provide a very thoughtful and well balanced education. I really want public schools in this country to be not just good, but great! When we moved to Corvallis, OR, I felt that some things slipped. While most of the educators in our school here seem good, there seems to be less unity of curriculum, and during the 2nd grade, my daughter slipped in math.. basically, she learned more advanced stuff in the 1st grade in Seattle and was considered gifted! Anyway, my point is that the public school system seems to vary a lot around the country, or even around a single city. My opinion is that having the money to have enough teachers to keep class sizes low is the single most important thing that would help. -- [[Ron Jandrasi]]",

The system was adopted from the Prussian model, with the purpose of creating skilled-but-manageable drones. That hasn't been always the purpose of the teachers, parents, or students (certainly not the students) but with time, and the liberal application of more and more of the psych \"sciences\" we've achieved a system that conditions and indoctrinates more than it educates. The parents and students still resist that model, but the teachers have become (largely) assimilated into the psych-borg. I worked as a consultant with the NEA (National Education Assn) over a four year period, and I can tell you with certainty, they are not your friends. The system is rotten from the top down. The only answer is to be better at educating your kids than the system is at indoctrinating them. -- gh",

Certain paradigms really threaten certain sacred conventions of today's \"enlightened\" academia, so if you flash too much of that stuff around, the \"enlightened\" crowd will stone you to death to prevent contamination of the sacred \"truths\" they so cherish. So some of this stuff I reserve for quiet, private conversations. I had an experience with a \"guru\" who allowed me to thrash around for weeks before I finally asked him what to do. The answer was (for him) simple and well known. I asked him indignantly why he let me waste so much time thrashing. His answer was, \"I don't dispense advice or knowledge unless it's asked for.\" I've had a hard time with that lesson, since I keep hoping that certain knowledge will register with some people if I give it freely. I'm nearly always wrong. But I'm always happy to convey what I know to anyone who asks. Sometimes what I know is even useful. And that makes it worthwhile. -- gh",

As political manipulators have discovered that TV provides a direct conduit for data (or a \"message\") modulating a \"carrier wave\" of entertainment, what TV has become is an indoctrination platform. Cute/fun/hillarious/emotional programs carry embedded social/political messages. You're talking to your kid one day and realize that he/she is spouting the most absurd <i>social engineering</i> crap you've heard. You ask where they got this from. They can't tell you. \"Everybody knows\" it's this way or that way. Occasionally, they'll identify the TV as source. But the real damage happens when 200 kids all get the same message from the same TV program, then get together and laugh/joke/discuss and <i>agree</i> about the message content.",
