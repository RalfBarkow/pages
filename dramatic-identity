A certain paragraph might make no sense at all if mislabelled, because when we listen, we're always listening to motivation as well as to the words, and Speaker A might have no conceivable motive for saying those words. Similarly, unlabelled discussion can be hard to follow, because a sentence may not make much sense if you don't know which position (which identity, which dramatis persona) is uttering it. If a single person is trying to lay out both sides of a question (whether or not he plans to ultimately present one side as superior), he has to be careful to let the reader know when he's \"speaking for\" which side, else the flow gets incoherent.

If a single person is trying to lay out both sides of a question (whether or not he plans to ultimately present one side as superior), he has to be careful to let the reader know when he's \"speaking for\" which side, else the flow gets incoherent.
