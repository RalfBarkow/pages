As with Leo, the main object in Grafoscopio was a document tree/outline and I had a kind of ugly hack that allowed me to use \"thisNotebook\" to refer to the file representing the outline (as shown in the screenshot of the Data Journalim Handbook transcription at [1]). I imagine that thisPage could refer to the object that is serialized as checksum.lepiter when represented on the filesystem. We could device something like thisPage parents first to choose from the contexts where the snippet is embedded/called.\n\n[1] https://mutabit.com/repos.fossil/mapeda/doc/tip/intro.md\n"

As we go from different ways of organizing information: graphs, hierarchies, infographies and so on, we need different interaction/organizing metaphors. At the moment I'm happy with TW as it frees me from hierarchy, but sometimes I need it, and new developments are done to provide TW of bullets and hierarchies when needed. (I think that as part of the tools for thought zeitgeist and recent cross-pollination). \n\nMy recent approach so far has been to use TW as a \"publishing platform\" for my thoughts and GT as a \"computing platform\" for them. At some point I would like to have a more integrated workflow between both. And I think that the path for that would be the TW server part implemented in Pharo/GT that we have talked elsewhere."

Zenodo, 2017. https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.1974261.\n> This manual documents the basics of Grafoscopio, a tool to make reproducible research and publishing, interactive documentation and literate computing, which allow authors to intertwine prose, code, data and visualizations into storytelling, and readers and coauthors can verify, collaborate on and extend the document claims and artifacts. The context for that cocreation is my PhD in Design and Creation in the University of Caldas (Manizales, Colombia) and in our local hackerspace HackBo (Bogotá, Colombia), but we are making something that moves beyond and between frontiers and our hope is to enhance that.\n\n"
