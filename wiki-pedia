Let's say Britannica took issue with 60 -- about half of those errors -- and then split the difference between Britannica and Nature's stories, so that 30 of the initial 123 are invalid. That leaves 93 errors in Britannica versus 162 in Wikipedia, suggesting 1.7 errors in Wikipedia for every error in Britannica. (If we assume Britannica is correct in asserting that about half the errors aren't actually errors, then the difference could be as large as 63:162 -- more than 2.5 errors in Wikipedia for every error in Britannica). If any significant fraction of the errors cited by Nature's editors are spurious then calling this selection of Wikipedia articles \"about as accurate as\" the Britannica ones seems generous.

It seems a complaint is that wikis are innately subjective and hence a wiki encyclopedia trying to massage objectivity from subjective sources (its contributors) will supposedly fail. I think that issue may be less relevant than it seems - it can be side-stepped by considering that what people really want is knowledge of relative consistency; objectiveness is not truly necessary until they get new information that conflicts/is not consistent (ie.

Wikis like Wikipedia have specific goals and these goals (like creating an encyclopedia) allow them to supersede (not eliminate) the subjective nature of wiki by providing some thing of more important value - in this case authoritative secondary information source. People deal with subjectiveness all the time in the offline world, such as one person loves a certain tv show, another person hates it. Paper encyclopedia have multiple contributors too. People's opinions are typically not atomic, hence a synergy/fusion of multiple of opinions is possible. That we have a stable diverse society relies on that fact.

Let's say Britannica took issue with 60 -- about half of those errors -- and then split the difference between Britannica and Nature's stories, so that 30 of the initial 123 are invalid. That leaves 93 errors in Britannica versus 162 in Wikipedia, suggesting 1.7 errors in Wikipedia for every error in Britannica. (If we assume Britannica is correct in asserting that about half the errors aren't actually errors, then the difference could be as large as 63:162 -- more than 2.5 errors in Wikipedia for every error in Britannica). If any significant fraction of the errors cited by Nature's editors are spurious then calling this selection of Wikipedia articles \"about as accurate as\" the Britannica ones seems generous.

Wikis like Wikipedia have specific goals and these goals (like creating an encyclopedia) allow them to supersede (not eliminate) the subjective nature of wiki by providing some thing of more important value - in this case authoritative secondary information source. People deal with subjectiveness all the time in the offline world, such as one person loves a certain tv show, another person hates it. Paper encyclopedia have multiple contributors too. People's opinions are typically not atomic, hence a synergy/fusion of multiple of opinions is possible. That we have a stable diverse society relies on that fact. If you keeping looking for pure objectivism in a subjective world, you are going to be like Diogenes searching for truly honest man - an unnecessary chore since people are equipped to handle nuances of subjective reality as a matter of course.",

Another issue to note is that having encyclopedia as \"majority rule\" opinion is to be expected and <i>important</i>. The goal is to make available stable knowledge on given topics. Now if you say that your minority opinion on a topic is correct and the majority opinion is false - so be it. As an encyclopedia is a secondary or tertiary source of information, it is <i>supposed</i> to represent the informed majority view on the topic - this makes it slower to changes but saves a lot more hassle for readers. If you consider your opinion correct, you present it as an appropriate primary source and more weight it gains in the suitable industry/field then more weight it gains in an consensus encyclopedia. Simple as that (or should be when things run smoothly). If your opinion for, say, pure air as a food, has problems against the majority opinion then either improve the case in the right places for debate or write in a different type of wiki as wikipedia needs to relatively NPOV in order to provide knowledge of some consistency to the reader.",

With few exceptions, all claims must have citations of <i>secondary references</i>, which mostly means newspaper and magazine articles, including some peer-reviewed scientific journals.

Notability must similarly be proven by coverage in the popular press! Oh, and anonymity is encouraged, so authors need not take personal responsibility for their edits. -- David Spector",
