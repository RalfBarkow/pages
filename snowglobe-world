Yes, it would be nice to have a simple way to do so. BTW , the snowglobe world (https://croquet.io/snowglobe) lets you drag and drop an  object to a snow sphere to make it the child of the sphere; so you can see that that can be done. – yoshiki via [https://discord.com/channels/694586717247635488/965416739779248158/1074496788976910408 discord]"
