Is it called Mont Blanc because of the color of the rock, or presence of snow?  The lived experience from 50 miles away prompted that question.  Depending on the cloud cover and sunlight, it was not always visible, nor clear what types of surfaces we were seeing.  A wiki search included photos of Europe's highest snow-capped peak, the disputed claims of France, Italy and Switzerland, and more.  But it was not until this sun-drenched morning, the distinctive color, texture and form of the mountain made itself present.  No longer blending into the clouds at 4,807  meters above sea level, no longer a question of how snow fields and glaciers could remain late into the year during a record-breaking August heatwave.  This mountain is all about the snow and rock grappling, forming, bonding, becoming one."
