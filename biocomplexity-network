The evolution of the Network was a response to the lack of integrated study and understanding of issues of complexity that were preventing progress on risk assessments, such as how to incorporate the very different models and diversity of topics and approaches used by social scientists in a field historically dominated by biologists. We recognized that predicting risk to endangered species requires more than specialized modeling expertise and biological knowledge, and we pursued collaboration between natural and social scientists (Nyhus et al. 2002). We also realized that understanding how such interdisciplinary networks function could be as important as the models, predictions, and policy suggestions they developed (Westley and Vredenburg 2003)."
