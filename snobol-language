SNOBOL was implemented in SIL, the \"SNOBOL Implementation Language\", a low-level \"assembly\" language for a [[Virtual Machine]]. The syntax and semantics of SIL were such that it could be (and generally was) implemented as a set of macros for your favorite assembler. The idea was that you wrote a few dozen macros implementing the SIL \"opcodes\" in a manner appropriate for your hardware and OS architecture, then you fed the macro definitions, followed by the SIL program for SNOBOL, into your assembler, and <i>voil√†;</i> out popped a SNOBOL interpreter. (Generally you had to link it with the FORTRAN IV I/O library to get something you could actually use.) The book <i>The Macro Implementation of SNOBOL4</i> describes the process, which was carried out successfully on many platforms. (In the days in which SNOBOL was invented, it was exceedingly rare for a language without an ANSI/ISO standard - <i>i.e.,</i> nearly all of them - to be available on any machine other than the one for which it was initially developed.)",

I was a Math/CS major, and a friend of mine was a Linguistics major who had a corpus of Old Saxon (see [[Anglo Saxon Language]]) that she needed to analyze for certain orthographic and phonological phenomena (whose nature escapes me... this was over 25 years ago). She had transcribed the passages into the Roman alphabet and typed them into the computer, and my SNOBOL program helped her scan the text looking for words and phrases matching certain patterns. I couldn't just write a program that would scan the text and match it against a fixed set of patterns, because she needed to look for different things in different contexts at different stages of her research. So I had to write a program that would allow her to enter descriptions (in a form she could use, which ruled out SNOBOL syntax; otherwise she could have just written her own programs) from which I would assemble, at run time, SNOBOL pattern objects, which I then used to scan her corpus. Basically I \"compiled\" her entry form into patterns, then read text in a loop, matching patterns against the input, and printing out matching sentences. Yes, another complexity was that she had entered the text in lines of no more than 80 characters (so it could be punched, naturally!), but she wanted to scan and match sentences, not lines. So I had to slurp the text line-by-line and break it into sentences on the fly.",

It is true that the control structures of SNOBOL are primitive, but the more you get to know SNOBOL the more you find that the pattern-matching facilities often substitute for control structures, making the latter less necessary than in many other languages. My own use of SNOBOL has been very limited, but I find for some purposes it is far more convenient than any other language I have come across.

The syntax and semantics of SIL were such that it could be (and generally was) implemented as a set of macros for your favorite assembler. The idea was that you wrote a few dozen macros implementing the SIL \"opcodes\" in a manner appropriate for your hardware and OS architecture, then you fed the macro definitions, followed by the SIL program for SNOBOL, into your assembler, and <i>voil√†;</i> out popped a SNOBOL interpreter. (Generally you had to link it with the FORTRAN IV I/O library to get something you could actually use.) The book <i>The Macro Implementation of SNOBOL4</i> describes the process, which was carried out successfully on many platforms. (In the days in which SNOBOL was invented, it was exceedingly rare for a language without an ANSI/ISO standard - <i>i.e.,</i> nearly all of them - to be available on any machine other than the one for which it was initially developed.)",

I was a Math/CS major, and a friend of mine was a Linguistics major who had a corpus of Old Saxon (see [[Anglo Saxon Language]]) that she needed to analyze for certain orthographic and phonological phenomena (whose nature escapes me... this was over 25 years ago). She had transcribed the passages into the Roman alphabet and typed them into the computer, and my SNOBOL program helped her scan the text looking for words and phrases matching certain patterns. I couldn't just write a program that would scan the text and match it against a fixed set of patterns, because she needed to look for different things in different contexts at different stages of her research. So I had to write a program that would allow her to enter descriptions (in a form she could use, which ruled out SNOBOL syntax; otherwise she could have just written her own programs) from which I would assemble, at run time, SNOBOL pattern objects, which I then used to scan her corpus. Basically I \"compiled\" her entry form into patterns, then read text in a loop, matching patterns against the input, and printing out matching sentences. Yes, another complexity was that she had entered the text in lines of no more than 80 characters (so it could be punched, naturally!), but she wanted to scan and match sentences, not lines. So I had to slurp the text line-by-line and break it into sentences on the fly.",

It is true that the control structures of SNOBOL are primitive, but the more you get to know SNOBOL the more you find that the pattern-matching facilities often substitute for control structures, making the latter less necessary than in many other languages. My own use of SNOBOL has been very limited, but I find for some purposes it is far more convenient than any other language I have come across. Even the pattern-matching facilities in [[Icon Language]] and its descendants do not have the same smoothness and ease of use.
