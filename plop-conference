OK, PLoP stands for Pattern Languages Of Programs, which is a conference series that started with the original [[Plop Conference]] in the U.S. (we will be having the 8th such conference ([[Plop Two Thousand Two]]) this coming September) and now includes conferences such as [[Euro Plop]] in Germany, [[Sugar Loaf Plop]] in Brazil, and [[Koala Plop]] down under in Australia. The PLoP's are different from other conferences in that there is not a \"program committee\" who reads and rejects and accepts papers on the first pass. Instead, there is a process called Shepherding, which assigns an experienced author to work with the author of a pattern or pattern language for a length of time (usually around two months) to work together on the paper and suggest improvements. At the end of the period, the shepherd gets a vote (together with a program committee member) as to whether or not the paper should be accepted for workshopping at the conference. -- [[Kyle Brown]]",

OK, PLoP stands for Pattern Languages Of Programs, which is a conference series that started with the original [[Plop Conference]] in the U.S. (we will be having the 8th such conference ([[Plop Two Thousand Two]]) this coming September) and now includes conferences such as [[Euro Plop]] in Germany, [[Sugar Loaf Plop]] in Brazil, and [[Koala Plop]] down under in Australia. The PLoP's are different from other conferences in that there is not a \"program committee\" who reads and rejects and accepts papers on the first pass. Instead, there is a process called Shepherding, which assigns an experienced author to work with the author of a pattern or pattern language for a length of time (usually around two months) to work together on the paper and suggest improvements. At the end of the period, the shepherd gets a vote (together with a program committee member) as to whether or not the paper should be accepted for workshopping at the conference. -- [[Kyle Brown]]",
