      "text": "Arizona State University (ASU) researchers have found that hackers could exploit virtual private networks (VPNs) to strip users&apos; anonymity and send them to bogus websites by tapping what ASU&apos;s William Tolley calls &quot;a fundamental networking vulnerability.&quot; The vulnerability monitors the presence and size of the data packets routed along the VPN. Attackers first send different-sized packets to different entry/exit ports, which if forwarded signals that the targeted port is the correct one; they can then send packets where they have altered the source address to seem as if they originate from one of the legitimate ends of the connection. The researchers say they have alerted a number of VPN providers to the attack, but it is unlikely that all currently used networks will be patched. Tolley said, &quot;Our advice is to avoid VPNs if you&apos;re trying to keep your information private from government entities, or something like that.&quot;"
