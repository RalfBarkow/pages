Within 15 minutes the Agile Manifesto was on the white board. Value 2 and 4 were put there by XP founders. Value 3 was argued for by me, a Scrum founder. Value 1 was a general discussion of all present.\n>\nWhen the other Signatories came back into the room, they looked at the board, Ward Cunningham said it was awesome, and none changed a word. We spent the afternoon writing the 12 principles behind the Manifesto.\n>\n[https://www.quora.com/Were-Agile-and-Scrum-developed-separately-and-do-they-overlap-or-complement-each-other/answer/Jeff-Sutherland-13?srid=uAHih quora]"
