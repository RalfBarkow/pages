I know none of you as individuals are anywhere near as \"ivory tower\" as you collectively appear in some of these programming pages... Well, a couple of you probably do fit the bill (\"you <b>KNOW</b> who you are!\") but, from reading these comments it seems SG served as a counterbalance. You work with limitations and this one's a biggy. The tool requires diversity, it requires there to be a balance in it's population of users and... it also seems to have some very steep slopes (instability) in this regard (scary part here). If one person like SG goes, others like him a feel a little less welcome, a little less like this is a place for <i>them</i>. and then they start baling and you all slide into a single, non-diverse bunch of people who argue about trivial things, because the differences between you are, well, <b>trivial</b>. And that's when you'll get diminishing returns on time spent in that discourse.",
