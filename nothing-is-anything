As such, Nothingness in terms of a pattern would be better described as [[Nothingness Is Everything]], regardless of time and space. Mapping this to programming languages or data is sort of difficult, as to explore the unknown of Nothingness tends to be quite difficult in that Anything from Nothingness cannot be exactly defined. Yet however, bearing the thought in mind that Everything eventually boils down to Nothingness and that Nothingness is purely based on the uncertainty principle defined elsewhere. Null or Nil is not Nothingness, except when being expressed as 1/0 which is, in fact, undefined and, when being projected unto a Cartesian coordinate system, will yield arbitrary values for y in y(x) = 1/x, where x = 0. At least, mathematicians cannot exactly define what Anything in Nothingness is, and this gives me some relief. Or does anybody know how to solve 1/0? C defines void as a datatype of arbitrary or unknown type, yet it points to a location in dynamic memory space, a space that which can only be emptied but not freed, emptying means simply putting nulls to whereas freeing exists only in terms of freeing up more memory, i.e. removing it from internal non-empty memory datastructures of the kernel's memory manager, yet, the memory or rather its contents is still not really freed but is in undefined state instead. Void is a construct that allows for arbitrary pointers to be passed to sub- or co-routines, that will then decide based on knowledge gained from the memory location, or, in case of a hierarchy of derived and therefore somehow related C-structures, to allow arbitrary casting from one type of structure to another one. This, however, will lead you to trouble in case differently structured structures are passed or the sub- or co-routine takes for granted that at least a given type-instance of a structure is passed as an argument. --[[Carsten Klein]]",
