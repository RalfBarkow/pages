Three factors seemed to contribute. Attending a conference necessitated being away from the day-to-day busyness of running a school, creating the [[Emergent Whitespace]] to think and reflect; keynotes and presentations were where new ideas emerged and there were like minded people to talk to about these ideas; and if I made a connection, there was a eureka moment, a surprise and sense of joy in that new realisation.

This was first within Australia after becoming a QASSP Travelling Scholar and organising a trip to Perth and another to Melbourne for teachers. Later, when I started working for QASSP this was through International study tours."

On a study tour you are not only away from the busyness of leading a school, but of all other aspects of your life; great ideas emerge from other people’s work and their context connections are made AND there is the opportunity to talk about these ideas with people you are connecting with in meaningful ways. Its powerful when we learn together!"
