This ‘bumping’ can happen at any time - when reading, listening to others and, especially for school leaders, when attending gatherings like conferences. This is when creative breakthroughs can emerge. Three factors contribute to such [[Eureka Moments]] occurring at gatherings like conferences. "

In addition keynotes and presentations offer new ideas or thinking to emerge, and especially if these people offer perspectives outside of education. And finally at these gatherings like minded people attend which means they have an understanding of the schooling context, and are driven by a similar purpose. Talking to colleagues about the about the ideas presented can spark new meaning. Attending a conference opens creative windows with new views, which is a place full of potential. "

Ideas can emerge from experiencing other people’s work and connections can be made to one's own context AND there is the opportunity to talk about these ideas with people with whom meaningful connections are be developed. Its powerful when we are engaged in [[Collective Learning]]!"
