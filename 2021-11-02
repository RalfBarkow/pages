For example, a lecture or presentation is transmitted from a lecture hall or studio to a corporate training center or to a PC at home. The advantage of this variant is that it enables bidirectional communication between teachers and learners. Experiences in various international projects show how difficult it is to overcome not only the spatial but also the social distance between people with the help of technology (see e.g. the EU projects in Held & Kugeman, 1995; Hesse et al., 1997). In fact, it must be noted with disappointment that the use of teleteaching in a large number of projects is reduced to the unidirectional transmission of lectures, etc., for which there are much cheaper and more attractive distribution variants (video, CD, etc.). -- Kerres, M. & Jechle, Th. (2000): Betreuung des Lernens in telemedialen Lernumgebungen, Unterrichtswissenschaft, 28 (3), S. 257 - 277, p. 270\n"

        "text": "A further decision has to be made with regard to the distinction between synchronous and asynchronous variants of interpersonal communication between learners and the supervising institution and whether these are realized by push or pull.\n\nIn synchronous communication, instructors and learners are present at the same time but in different locations. For example, a lecture or presentation is transmitted from a lecture hall or studio to a corporate training center or to a PC at home. The advantage of this variant is that it enables bidirectional communication between teachers and learners. Experiences in various international projects show how difficult it is to overcome not only the spatial but also the social distance between people with the help of technology (see e.g. the EU projects in Held & Kugeman, 1995; Hesse et al., 1997). In fact, it must be noted with disappointment that the use of teleteaching in a large number of projects is reduced to the unidirectional transmission of lectures, etc., for which there are much cheaper and more attractive distribution variants (video, CD, etc.). -- Kerres, M. & Jechle, Th.
