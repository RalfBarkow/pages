The fact that the exchange of assets does not participate directly in the process of the production of commodities, does not mean that they do not produce anything.

Financial activities are ‘productive’ in the sense that they reproduce and reshape power relations. Now, if assets are the units of capitalized power, and if power is (among other things) power over production, then production is ultimately governed by the ownership of assets.
