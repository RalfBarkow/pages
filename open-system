For biological systems, one thinks primarily of energy input and output of useless energy; for sense systems, one thinks primarily of exchange of information. A sense system draws information from its environment, interprets, if we may say so, surprises, and is built into a network of other systems that responds to this information-processing system. The basic condition that explains entropy is the same in both cases, namely exchange relations between system and environment. This is what the term open system refers to."

How can an operation type internally recognize that certain operations belong to the system and other operations do not? This question has become significant, for example, for immunology, for the theory of the immune system, since the end of the 1960s."
