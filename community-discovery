However, many large networks often lack a particular community organization at a global level.

We tested this intuition against the state-of-the-art overlapping and non-overlapping community discovery methods, and found that our new method clearly outperforms the others in the quality of the obtained communities, evaluated by using the extracted communities to predict the metadata about the nodes of several real world networks. We also show how our method is deterministic, fully incremental, and has a limited time complexity, so that it can be used on web-scale real networks."

Suddenly, everything around the ego makes sense and some groups can be easily spotted. These groups correspond to the high school and university friends, mates from different workplaces and the members of an online community (we know all these details because the chosen ego is one of the authors of this paper). The ego is part of all these communities and knows that particular subsets of its neighborhood are part of these communities too. Probably, different egos have different perspectives over the same neighbors and it is the union of all these perspectives that creates an optimal partition of the network. In other words: if node A and node B are considered in the same communities by all the nodes connected to both A and B, then they should be grouped in the same community. This is achieved by a democratic bottom-up mining approach: in turn, each node gives the perspective of the communities surrounding it and then all the different perspectives are merged together in an overlapping structure."

        "text": "Here, we chose one of the 15k nodes from the previous example and extracted what we call its “ego minus ego” network, i.e. its ego network in which the ego node has been removed, together with all its attached edges. Suddenly, everything around the ego makes sense and some groups can be easily spotted. These groups correspond to the high school and university friends, mates from different workplaces and the members of an online community (we know all these details because the chosen ego is one of the authors of this paper). The ego is part of all these communities and knows that particular subsets of its neighborhood are part of these communities too. Probably, different egos have different perspectives over the same neighbors and it is the union of all these perspectives that creates an optimal partition of the network. In other words: if node A and node B are considered in the same communities by all the nodes connected to both A and B, then they should be grouped in the same community. This is achieved by a democratic bottom-up mining approach: in turn, each node gives the perspective of the communities surrounding it and then all the different perspectives are merged together in an overlapping structure."
