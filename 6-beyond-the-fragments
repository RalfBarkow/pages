Espoused values are flabby, I feel: jaw-flapping, idealist (yuk! did we learn *nothing* from Marx?), fatally weak in the face of fiat - material force, material provision, material separation, material organisation. OK, that’s my melancholia kicking in! But also, it’s the systemiser, the engineer-designer; and the activist of rank-&-file skilling-*contra*-deskilling (such an important politics of the early post-Fordist 70s), who asks how practices are *materially* interwoven, and where - in which actual spaces and locations - *value-ings* are coproduced and mobilised, self-consciously and intentionally, skillfully and manifestly, in *actual* aware collaborations.

In the spring of 2016 I contacted Robin because I found myself engaging, with others of my baby-boomer generation, in the production of legacy, and felt a powerful need for his present-day perspective as an older comrade who spanned a little further back: into the May Day Manifesto, new Left generation of the 60s, when I was still in school. By the time we exchanged mails again, late 2016, I had begun hatching the idea of a ‘college of conviviality’ \\[Illich xxx] which would steward activist legacy and cultivate the capability of cultivating *‘tools for conviviality’*; and was needing his perspective (along with Stephen Yeo’s, as a May Day peer of Robin’s, and an ex-President of Ruskin College) on the need for and nature of such a thing. Thus, formacion was the root of my most recent engagement with Robin. \n"
