Affairs are explained as a matter of [[Shame]], and the person cheated on is left no “face” and thinks they have no choice but to kill themselves in order to prove the injustice done to them. Those with mental illness similarly see it as shameful and something that leaves them unable to fulfill their roles. Unable to live up to familial or social requirements, they see little alternative to suicide."

Not to receive one’s proper food is considered expulsion from the family; to be mistreated by one’s sons is considered the destruction of one’s status as father. Blame for not having fulfilled one’s role [[Obligation]]s (serving one’s grandmother, carrying water) is perceived as de facto ejection from one’s kinship group. The inability to marry prevents one from achieving central role-identity characteristics, and such a situation can be highly precarious, especially for those who are already at the bottom of the role hierarchy. If identity can be found only in successful role fulfillment and community relationships, then a denial of role recognition is perceived as catastrophic. Since the onion has no pit, there is no “personal core” that one can retreat to."

In such cases the only way out, it may seem, is to let the onion, that is, one’s network of relationships, crumble. Without a “pit,” proactive agency is difficult to establish on one’s own, so suicide, as a radical form of “passive aggression,” becomes an option. By killing oneself, the subject who is denied [[Person]]hood within the family brings severe disrepute to that family and thereby shames and socially punishes it. If someone feels that they have “lost face”—that is, their identity—at the hands of their family, they can in turn make the whole family lose face by committing suicide. The family is publicly exposed as dysfunctional and violating proper role enactment. The act of suicide serves as an act of revenge for the injustice received—the denial of role identity—and is intended to bring the perceived perpetrators to justice by harming their reputation and status within the local community."

From the insult, to the [[Duel]] [⇒ [[Tödliche Konflikte]]], to the malevolent misdiagnosis, everything that happened between Casanova and Colonel Branicki was a function of their social roles and the expectations tied to them. Sincerity can provide meaning and identity. But it can also outweigh the desire to live and make those whose roles are violated feel bereft enough to commit suicide or kill others just to prove a point. In guiding how to live, sincerity also informs decisions about how to die."

      "text": "Importantly, even when people do not commit suicide or challenge others to combat, the regime of sincerity can prove a crushing demand. The helicopter parent who stifles their own personal life, and their son’s childhood, feels an overwhelming duty to “be there” for the child. On the other extreme, parents who obsess over work and providing for their children might find themselves living some version of Harry Chapin’s Cats in the Cradle: “When you comin’ home dad? I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then. You know we’ll have a good time then.” Anyone can feel the pressure to continually perform, to meet goals, and to otherwise live according to certain expectations. But the most glaring difficulty with sincerity is its internal paradox. At the heart of all these issues, from suicides and duels to obsession with family life or professional achievement, is the impossible demand for a person’s inner psychology to become fully congruent with external social expectations. As with any other method of achieving identity, sincerity has as much potential to enrich as to oppress, especially when obsessively overidentifying with one’s roles so that any other aspects or potentials of selfhood seem false or wrong, or even evil."

        "text": "Importantly, even when people do not commit suicide or challenge others to combat, the regime of sincerity can prove a crushing demand. The helicopter parent who stifles their own personal life, and their son’s childhood, feels an overwhelming duty to “be there” for the child. On the other extreme, parents who obsess over work and providing for their children might find themselves living some version of Harry Chapin’s Cats in the Cradle: “When you comin’ home dad? I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then. You know we’ll have a good time then.” Anyone can feel the pressure to continually perform, to meet goals, and to otherwise live according to certain expectations. But the most glaring difficulty with sincerity is its internal paradox. At the heart of all these issues, from suicides and duels to obsession with family life or professional achievement, is the impossible demand for a person’s inner psychology to become fully congruent with external social expectations. As with any other method of achieving identity, sincerity has as much potential to enrich as to oppress, especially when obsessively overidentifying with one’s roles so that any other aspects or potentials of selfhood seem false or wrong, or even evil."

Along with rapid modernization, economic growth, and urbanization, the suicide rate fell spectacularly. Still, China stands out in one respect: It “is one of the few countries in the world that has a higher suicide rate by women over men.”7 As empirical research suggests, both the prevalence of female over male suicide and the prevalence of rural over urban suicide can be related to a continued regime of sincerity in a preindustrialized setting where women, given their subordinated status, suffer even more from role pressures than men."

Along with rapid modernization, economic growth, and urbanization, the suicide rate fell spectacularly. Still, China stands out in one respect: It “is one of the few countries in the world that has a higher suicide rate by women over men.”"

Because people who suffer domestic injustice are likely to become depressed and commit suicide, of course psychiatry will play an important role in the control of suicide; but people do not merely want to be mentally healthy. They also want to be happy and lucky, and this is already beyond the reach of psychiatry. After a long period of fieldwork on suicide, I have come to understand suicide [in China] from the perspective of justice. – Wu Fei, Suicide and Justice: A Chinese Perspective (New York: Routledge, 2009), 6."
