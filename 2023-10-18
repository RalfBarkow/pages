Something can be said about Smalltalk programming style that may lead to smaller methods (but 'deeper' call graphs) that python or Java, but this may also be tied to the coder UI interfaces historically tied to Smalltalks and now to Gt. How a tool looks probably affects the type of code you end up writing in it. One big empty text editor may foster long methods. The visual abstraction of the Gt coder, with collapsible method definitions could be extended to other languages where saving a method coder would serialize to a normal text file.

      "text": "hey there everyone so I've got a little bit of time tonight and I'm just going to talk about this animation that I'm trying to make so if you've seen any of my J videos this might look a little familiar this is a animation that I run whenever I have a scene transition so I have a little this little bar comes down and spreads across the screen and then uh screen and it types out whatever word you want it to say so say you know Welcome to My Stream then it will whoops I'm sorry it goes up here so the same title should be welcome to my screen I stream when we set the text length to zero at the start and then when it comes down uh so this this this little guy comes down and that gets printed out and um so I think Godot can actually do a little bit better job of um rendering this font right now it's not very anti-alias and I think I think that's just the settings of my project um but yeah for the way I have set up at the moment um but yeah so but but basically on the screen it looks the way I want it to look and you know this is an animation I've been using since for years in fact I think I even had a version of it in blender uh and I've made this animation like several times in different engines you know like not necessarily used in a in a in a video but in any case I have this and I wanted to Port it to my new animation engine that I am building so um I drew the scene um so just as a quick update I had this thing called sketch app you can now drag the canvas around um it's a little buggy but there are panels that you can drag around and resize and like dock to various places um you can create a bunch of circles or whatever select them turn them all blue you can align their centers in different ways or you know what not um come on so you you know you can uh say we can make this one come to the front send to back press me send it back bring to front do all that kind of stuff there is a text tool where you can select a text and you can write once I added this dragging thing these little resizers move to the wrong place but you can say you want just to be a font like impact and you want it to be 100 and you want X to be yeah I was uh and then you want the color to be one of these colors up here say ffcc 99 which I always remember and then if you could see the bottom of this uh font of this form you could hit the checkbox and it would loud and whatever you can move around so um a lot of the drawing stuff is there some of it is not great um it's got a little bit of a bug I actually have some work on a line tool which I've not demoed before so this might not uh this is actually a cat mole from fine I'm not sure why it's taking so long to click but anyway and you can take these little pieces and move them around it's a little bit different than a bezier's line because the pieces are you know the points all lineup or rather the points rather the points the the path goes through all the points except for this little virtual point at the start and at the end um so that's pretty cool and actually that I'm not sure if it updates but it it respected my choice of this color um a little bit buggy uh very very early very very sorry early demo of this thing yeah uh not even it's a little it's not Pixel Perfect in grabbing the thing exactly sure why this used to be very readable now it's very dark but is back up here I guess you you can see that it doesn't quite enough anyway so the point is I got drawing tools and I was able to make enough of that scene the scene that I can you know approximate the the look that I wanted to have so um I can actually load that from Json now um so we can load and save to Json you'll notice this doesn't always put the right font in supposed to be cool and Park but it just doesn't uh doesn't pick it up sometimes I'm not entirely sure why that's a bug I'm not sure if it's a bug on my part or just like that but if I kick it enough times it you know you can you can make it work um there's no way to make it bold in the UI yet I think this button that button may or may or may not work but anyway you can get we can approximate the look and feel of the thing actually I think we wanted to I think I also have to make this scene uh I'm sorry set it to a different particular size yeah there we go um then the The Next Step would be to add some animation frames to it now I do have animation in here um animation does work I can create animations and I've kind of refactored a little bit so this is you might have seen this in my earlier videos [Music] so this is all created with code though and even today everything I'm going to be doing is going to be created through code but I want to get a little bit closer to you know uh making this animation the way I want it to work so right now the animation here is a property of this thing the GS player app which used to be called GS animator and you know like it wasn't it's application of itself but not of its own and I factored out this timeline widget so that's shared with the other thing which is the drawing thing which is called a sketch app and uh talking does not that thing does not behave properly when it's undocked it's sort of weird like this too to make it bigger you drag this little resizer down and then it pushes the container up also a little bit silly um but yeah so so the point is that once you you get the the uh tracks and the positions and whatnot in the right place you can do the animations you want to do um but this only works for two properties right now um You can set the position and you can set the rotation you cannot set the size and so I need to set the size to make this little box come down and to expand across the stream screen and I'll need to set a custom property here for making the text come out so you can see that there is some sense of some concept of what a property is uh so this this inspector okay I can bring it over to this side uh has the the font is a little really it's really faint it's really hard to see that but it says ID and then you can give it whatever name you want so I named this uh blue rectangle back here of the stripe text this is not in any order right now and those are the two elements in my scene so those two items are the only things in the scene um it's got a coordinates or a pair of coordinates a point it's got a fill color which is one of these colors from the Arne uh palette and that's about it um yeah and you can serialize this so so the way I'm serializing now you know as I draw whatever I want and then I come down here and I run this piece of code this little snippet right here that just makes a string and then dumps the Json surrounded by single quotes and Json uh is a is generated by actually the same the very same tool that is not this generating this inspector it's called Magritte it's a meta model and basically you describe the objects and the fields and what properties they have and what their labels are and then you can extend it and so you can tell it what the Json key should be or you know I created a thing that lets you tell it what the Json key should be and so when I run this um variable or should I do wrong I don't know what is wrong I think I have something selected maybe uh and you and it can make a Json string for you it's a little hard to read I can make this bigger and uh but then everything else will not be readable [Music] but because I appended this then now it's actually a command that I can copy and paste in into this tool down here and I for now I just have a bunch of things saved that way that I'm kind of working on um I'll show that in a second but basically uh you you say Json GS Json reader GS being the name of this or the code for this framework and then you read this chunk of Json and whatever you get it's you know here's a class here's some fills here's some children here's some text uh you notice um I know it's really hard to parse through all this stuff but the uh the text does not have in fact I bet if you I think if you say this all right if you just do this and we inspect this I think we'll get a Json Oh weird okay well whatever uh if I inspect this it should render as Json and you can get the data uh but doesn't like that so there's some problem with it yeah so it's a little buggy got some issues with the saving and whatnot so I'm still um doing a lot of this where I'm just editing this stuff by hand but you know once you get it this way now [Music] did that save it all right you can't copy it okay well so that's dumb yeah so I gotta fix that I don't want to derail this this whole demo but um I can just get it to parse so the GS Tech shape with wings and then yeah so it's missing that here we go and now we can parse it and we see some actual data um so uh but like it like you can see that this now you can probably see that this is missing the coordinates of the text so it doesn't save that and everything it goes back to the top left so the way this works um and and this is how we're gonna have to extend everything else here is GS text shape uh this is something I made to wrap the you know to adapt the built-in you know editable label concept to um my framework here and we can browse it a little bit we can see this area is a bunch of stuff these should actually be um Google doesn't agreed um but so these descriptions are uh are descriptions of the fields I guess I picked a bad example because [Music] all right all right so and then we have to refresh the scene I made this thing and it's not it's very very much a work in progress this little browser thing but but you can get these examples and you basically you create um on each as as instance methods you create a description for the fields in your in your class and so [Music] um you can annotate methods with these things called pragmas in in pharaoh and uh then you can query for all the things with that with that annotation so then you can make a view like this that shows you know show me all the things with that um with that annotation uh and up here these are things that we've that I've added to the the overall Graphics framework so [Music] you notice there is no place to put a position and that was because I was experimenting with the uh notion of having the circle like be positioned from its Center and something else being positioned from from elsewhere so um if we want to add a point for the text at the moment what we're going to do and maybe this will change we got to find the text shape and we have to make a new method and I just copied that message over from the the circle shape so I would say I'm just going to call this XY description or let's say position description um it's interesting that Circle does not have a Json key either so I think that was actually foreign yes yeah so I haven't done this yet the idea is that we can uh I didn't know how to extend Magritte to allow um allow Json keys but so give me a second here we're going to call this position GS position and we're going to call this position the GS position wraps the block stuff and then um a wrapper for that so now we look at the make great descriptions here we have a position description and somewhere in here yeah we have to wrap this if we want to give it a Json key this is not the way you're supposed to do this um is it not even saving the text it does GS text oh because right so so if the accessor is simple enough then you can just set you you can just tell it an accessor right um and then by default there's just taking that access sort of be the yeah okay so so then if I if if I were to do this right now again I'd have to um I'm not sure I think I have to restart the whole thing SketchUp let's load this of this one and then we'll export the text again it's not going to be right but now you can see it has a GS position GS position is wrong uh because it wasn't saving where I wanted it to save before um all right but now we have that thing um well um so my intent is to use that exact same system for the Json uh generation the inspector so this should say now that we've added that that should have a position field in here I haven't specified what order they should be in and it's not like truncating the formatting these numbers very nicely but it's there [Music] um I think if I accept this and then if I if I dump this out now I would expect that to be truncated a little bit but but it's not being truncated in the form here I truncated to three decimal places uh in the in the Json output anywhere else anyway so um you know this is all corrupt still so I'm not going to worry about that right now um the point is that uh I've got a bunch of features in here um and this thing Magritte this meta model is that I've just been demonstrating is what is what is powering the Json description it's both the reader and the writer and the inspector and I wanted to power the the animator uh but we're not quite there yet uh because before I knew about I made the animator before I learned about my greet um and like uh you know I looked into Magritte thinking that hey you know this might be this might do what it is that I'm trying to build because I had pictured this you know this sort of system where um but right so I made some design decisions that it turns out I could have done a little bit differently uh so for example the uh if I look at that GS text again uh lots of places where lost track of where it is but she has text shape and we look at some agreed descriptions uh that we are inherited uh you see I've added stuff to BL element and some of the other things I've added to uh PL elements like if I if I search here and I say package yeah and I say um my package name so you can extend any any object uh with what's called extension methods uh so they live in Europe oh sorry so so yeah so there the tag is with the star and then the name of the pack uh but so I've added all these things like GS bottom and GS Center that allow me to directly manipulate the position of any of any object of any visible object of any element right it's like the the core object in Block um the in you know the the position accessor in um uh in this Fork a block is not metric you you read it with position but you set it with relocate uh because because generally most of the time elements do not set their own position they're they're positioned by whatever container they're in uh but in my in my in my case here uh you know we do want we you know you are the author and you are drawing a picture in so you want to put things where you want to put them and so so objects do need to know their their position and that has to be something that's um serialized so it's still a little messy like these things they have some State associated with them when so when you set the position you can't just immediately read it right and so there needs to be uh there needs to be to be some some work done with that um but I'm not going to get into that I I've been rambling and showing like showing off stuff I I want to get into a little bit of actual coding and then probably wrap this up pretty early it's not going to be an eight hour stream um okay so bottom line is that I I basically copied and pasted this cleaned it up somewhere and I I've now stuck it in a uh thing called GS animator examples examples are meant to be something like a test Suite uh so but but that return a result and that can be chained together and put assertions in here I don't have any assertions but this little green box means that no assertions were you know failed during the Run of this last time it was run um so here we go here's the the scene as it was saved here um still it's not bold I don't know why sometimes I don't know if I can get it to be bold you can see it's not even the same font every time and that's a little weird um I don't know what to do about that um I can put a position in here now if I want and so I can put this at the position that it was in uh here so uh the position of the label never moves the label never moves it's always at this position which is which is form 128 and 254. so position so GS position uh and it's always in a circle and it has an app sign in the middle and it was 128. at what 128 at 254. now I have no idea if the uh if the coordinate system in Godot like where text is looks like the Anchor Point is up on the top left and I think that's going to be the same for for this and the size of this is fonts well that doesn't seem right no font size 120 pixels right okay and also this is 100 if I make this uh you know you you know uses a lot of screen real estate yeah so this is how big it should be and this is rendered at um 1080p which is the size of the entire that doesn't seem right yeah oh and yeah okay so yeah yeah so so when it when it's rendered in real time it actually scales the window because this is this is the size of renders that I don't know why it's not showing so the the full size of this one it it's not set to trigger that animation so I guess it rescales it to whatever the size should be so it's gonna look something about the size so so so probably that's about twice as big as it should be and so so the font size should be 64. set at 128 right now and it's probably for a 4K screen and it should be scaled down in half oops that didn't work uh it's because I'm missing a comma right there for the world okay I'm gonna make my screen huge for just a second because I want to see yeah um so I don't know if you can see that now but it looks like that's where the where it should be uh and that looks about right when you have when you can see the whole screen it looks about right I cannot scale this um so I I or I guess I can scale it but yeah I guess if you oh interesting um not sure what to say about that uh so this is actually set at uh not sure why I'm not sure why it's size that way I've seen uh size scene extend that was sent to no or this is the scene so it's self-exting okay whatever I don't know why it's that size I guess because I haven't told it any size and it's just matching the parent um but because I'm I'm on a smaller screen right now I'm going to try and set this to uh uh so we're gonna say scene uh seeing extend or scenes size 800 at 600. this is just for for testing once I have the ability to zoom these things that's gonna make a big difference wow this failed that because of invalid input but if we just ran it didn't we did I break something again confused I don't know all right again you can see if you look at the font you can really tell that it's like like this is the default font for GT and this is the font I want except I want it to be bold and this is being ignored so I don't know I think like if I just run this now if I just do this no child named text it found then you know do key equals now and I have no idea why that doesn't work just some kind of risk condition so I'm gonna ignore this I'm gonna ignore the font for now that's something let's see for later so this works all right so now the now the question is we need to wrap it and give it a a player so scenes should be my head's in the way isn't it seems should be should have this this text should have this ability to animate themselves uh but I didn't start out that way I didn't start out putting the animation on the scene I I built it from the UI out and so the UI is what contains the animation at the moment uh and so I did factor out this um this little guy that's what I did is I just you know I I took the self you know I took this example and now I'm calling it and I'm making a new player app that has this scene and the player app has this animation tool built into it this panel right here and then we're adding a track for the strike position and I just went through before the stream started and I copied the uh the what do you call them the keyframes the keyframe values from here manually um it's a little bit different Godot is timed in terms of or you know specified in terms of time because you have a variable frames per second based on you know how well the engine is running um whereas here I'm trying at least in my current way of thinking I'm going to have specific frames per second and Target a very specific frame rate which is 24 frames per second or 30 frames per second or whatever I think uh I think my YouTube videos are generally 30 frames per second which is really all you need unless you're like doing you know games or something uh okay so yeah so that's that's coming in right nice but you can see and and it does line up and um I think if that were both that would probably look about right um let me make the funnel a little bit bigger I don't think my and then if I run this and when we bring this down here [Music] I do want to get uh panning and zooming here zooming is built into um you know you can the zooming framework is already there in this system you can scale everything um but uh just as the the text was you know getting out of a sync with its its bounding box uh I'd have to I I did I did some work to address that and I have the same work to address scaling and so uh I don't want to click on something and then have the you know it's huge and it's going to have these little tiny control points right so I need to I need to fix that oh that's interesting yeah you can see this is this is where it's from here so you have this same problem if I scaled it uh so I just haven't haven't set that up yet that's on my list to do soon because then I'll be able to zoom in and out and see the whole scene with the mouse wheel um Okay so but so anyway I've added this now so I this worked this worked just great um and it's just in the wrong place it really needs to be part of the scene so that I can serialize it for one um and and so all this is you add a track for the stripe so it's a you know the first thing is what is the name of the thing you're doing so that's why I gave it a name up here has an ID called striped what is the name of the shape you are animating the second one is what is the property on there animating all right so the way this works oh so then we'll see this and this will not work adding size does not work and as soon as I move this I'm gonna get a bunch of Errors so GS Prop class is not in indexable um uh and so that has to do with the word size is used to indicate like the size of an array um and so that it's complaining that it's not an array right in small talk that's the convention that's what that's what the word size usually means it's overwritten you mean something else now I believe I can say oh no I can't right so if I say GS size uh that's not going to save me at all right it's not gonna work but it might do something different we'll do something different yeah it says it does not understand GSX which is what it was trying to say before but but size was defined for object so it inherited that okay um yeah object is overloaded with so many things that uh I I I personally would not have so many things on object but 50 year old language evolution of the 50 year old language okay so for a slot name on object GS prop perform a slot name and so what this is let's actually load it up here rather than in the debugger so we say GS spot with any luck I describe a point but that's actually GS Point description I I yeah what did I say IGS but it's not the word was it his prop is the word I don't know I got the words all right so this was my first take at something like uh this meta model thing I tried to make it look a little bit like Magritte using this right too and so on there's also thing called slots in in Pharaoh itself um but right now we have we have properties for a position and what it does is it says oh interesting how does this work ah I see so the word creating this was not I didn't think this out very well all right because it's on the class side so if we look at the um class side objects we filter down to the class side object you can see it yeah position and rotation are the only two ones that are defined and if we want to add a new one like size which I think is what we're going to call it uh then we need to have a GS uh size problem and then we need to create that class and so that's going to be a type of GS prompt GS prop and it is getting that thing and then save it and we'll just copy whatever that does all right so look at what the rotation prop does and so so rotate rotation is not a property in uh in in this framework it's not just an angle but I want to imagine that it's an angle and so I said a Target transform rotate by a degree value of y so this is what you have to do is you have to take that element you get it to transform you call rotate buy and then you apply it so you can do all kinds of things with the transform more than just rotating position same thing uh actually this one right so so by default read hmm what does he get oh anyway yeah because we're not reading them right you need to read when you're setting when you're creating the keyframes and I I'm doing it all by hand right now so this read is not just implemented yet and we won't need it for tonight so all I need to do is implement this one method uh right here in size prop and you know I was not necessarily thinking that this would only be for shapes at when I originally made it so it doesn't say whatever uh but it really should be a shape and so we're going to write a a size to a shape which is really a point I'm going to say a shape and we're going to say gsis uh so right so so now okay well that does not exist so anywhere in the GSX tent I just don't have an access for this uh okay so size whatever so these are very simple like they're originally called Setters and then when I realized I need to read things too and then then I started calling it props and then I realized well Magritte does this and maybe um whatever so when you uh they're also tied to handles like the index prop at index prompt this is used by the handles to move to uh the handles in a path to move the point at that index in the path right you know like it's a collection it's a list of points and then you just generate one for each point in the in the index and you can read and write so read actually does work here and I guess for this one because this one actually needs to read it to generate the handle the size prop I guess could do the same so and so if we want to read a a shape then we say a shape at we just say something or I guess extent uh you cannot write the extent for the similar reasons to why you cannot call the uh I'm going to say it's deprecated and you should use size instead um so yeah I don't really like this system but that should work and if we copy this class and and we say well let's just say GS selector problem right I'm thinking ahead to the uh selector prop and we're going to give it a selector see this is this is looking very very much like um a symbol uh like the way um agreed Works mcgreet has this whole notion of things called accessors and they have re-selectors right selectors a symbol but I'm going to just do this uh so read elector is equal to a symbol and we'll make that a property of this and so basically you're going to configure this by giving it a selector to read and select your right right selector symbol I don't think I actually saved read select yeah I didn't save it so lead selector and then I saved the instance variable but I didn't save the method so now that if you just rename things and then save it again you get a copy I have to actually right click and say like rename message to accurate okay so so this is going to be for the the text going across the screen and um I am running low on time here but I'm going to just kind of wrap this up so I might actually just I don't have I don't have the thing right so let's just do the extent this this should work now so if I have a gsi's prop then I have to go into gsrop and I have to say [Music] um of size so I do I do have that and then if I want to add uh with selectors so read a reader a read selector and write a write selection I know I'm getting a little bit of my head of myself here but we will say return GS what do they call it uh yes accessor prop this selector prop selector prop new and then we're going to say read selector a read selector and write selector a and right and so this is called a Cascade it's a semicolon there so it's going to send all these messages to that one object it's going to update itself and and each one of them the final result if you don't return anything is to return the object itself okay so that's that's all set um and so then I oh right and then this one I I read and write in eight shapes size um definitely needs to be merged with the Magritte support for points but whatever and then this one we can where's the other one I made that was the I'm almost done sweetie I'll be out in a little while okay okay I probably gotta wrap this up but I really want to see something on the screen so right selector right to read select or read two and then we're going to say oh right so this is not how we do this so we have to say perform is it arguments argument you say perform with arguments and then we're gonna say a size nope it's not this is we're gonna say perform right selector so bottom right selector with arguments a size and then to read it we're going to perform a uh reset comment which so now I could I could implement this with uh I could use this to replace all these things well not the rotation because the rotation is complicated not the indexing because that's complicated I'm going to give myself a 10 more minutes and then we'll try and wrap this up uh so anyway so I think some of these could be replaced with with this one it's more General and also uh all the whole thing could probably be replaced with Negrete in the future but I'm just I just want to get this on the screen right now all right so I've added this uh this is called size so this is the symbol that's passed to GS prop to tell it um oh okay so this should work yeah so now we've got this it it grows and it expands I like that um and so now to do the text we need to add the lengths here and so length shown I have to add that as a uh as a selector I'm almost done sweetie give me a couple minutes okay and then um I need to add this to be uh GS prompt so if I say I create a method called blank shown and this has to be on the class because it's a Constructor for for the class we're going to say we're going to return GS selector prop new and read selector right selector okay I'm just I'm just making a video I'll be almost I'm almost done okay the recollector is uh I have to implement this and right selector is length shown and I have to add this to the text right so we have to add this to GS Tech shape we have to add both of those accessors and so we can say uh length shown is here and then uh click this to commit that this is also in the Greek form so they're using that to describe the objects and generate the forms uh internally in in glamorous toolkit here and so we create accessors and so those should have added two uh two new but we're only looking at descriptions we want to look here we look under accessing we should see length shown um and so when we do this we need to reject rate this is a number actually so a number and then we're going to self redecorate which is to redraw the text uh and when we redraw the text uh font size size font size and then right sorry so we say so text color is self text color font size is the font size I don't know why text color is oh because it's a function you have to we don't I don't want to duplicate that function call uh and then I lost my place here just like chattering away out there I think it's bedtime for them it's usually an hour later you know school has started so uh my schedule's a bit off all right so I'm almost done with this and then we're gonna say uh uh text shoot okay so I have to do this I have to say um I have to say full text full string all right so when we set this all right so first of all in the initialization this should be called it should be to be in initializing uh x equals new text right so it calls that that's good so text I gotta get this listening for changes but um yes now we have initial ization here oops so in initialization we're calling text and then from text we say we can say self we'll just say full string equals a string and super text equals a string let's do this uh I don't think this is going to be something we're all right so so uh like shown like shown equals eight string size again and then what do we need to do at when we call that setter bring this back down here in the accessor for that thing the length shown so in when we recall redecorate uh not size super text because we don't want to use R text it can be full oh sorry I think we have to start over because we need the text first because then we you can't decorate the text until it's there so self is full string foreign how do you say this banana you know whatever I'm almost done guys come on give me like a couple more seconds okay five more minutes how do you find the first part of a string comparing accessing substring is called substring now I'm gonna look up on Google here take the first and I know you can do this I know I put a string in pharaoh you do it okay copy from text full string copy from one two and we have to wrap this whole thing because it thinks it's all one message so we can wrap this from there copy from to uh uh length clean title animation nope not this this is garbage animation nope it's over here gotta find this example again so animated text run this again it should work now oh no does not understand title animate position and size oh because it doesn't understand this battle card anime animated position and title card not without not the word scene okay let me run this uh no we don't need this we don't need the GS player anymore because we already have it um right now we have three tracks yes ah there we go hello world ah out of bounds 14. okay we're almost done we're almost there what was this yes two full string size max length shown copy from thank you X yes that's all we needed to do we just need to check that balance condition and then oh [Music] okay crop you want from to protect I want to admin not Max and here's my thing going ah come on I'm like seconds away from you can't see my screen I have this problem on my phone where I can't see the screen come on okay super text length shown equals zero okay it's true and we're gonna set the text to empty if false then full string copy from min of that and then this is save it and this should work yes animator examples we run it and hello world"

        "text": "hey there everyone so I've got a little bit of time tonight and I'm just going to talk about this animation that I'm trying to make so if you've seen any of my J videos this might look a little familiar this is a animation that I run whenever I have a scene transition so I have a little this little bar comes down and spreads across the screen and then uh screen and it types out whatever word you want it to say so say you know Welcome to My Stream then it will whoops I'm sorry it goes up here so the same title should be welcome to my screen I stream when we set the text length to zero at the start and then when it comes down uh so this this this little guy comes down and that gets printed out and um so I think Godot can actually do a little bit better job of um rendering this font right now it's not very anti-alias and I think I think that's just the settings of my project um but yeah for the way I have set up at the moment um but yeah so but but basically on the screen it looks the way I want it to look and you know this is an animation I've been using since for years in fact I think I even had a version of it in blender uh and I've made this animation like several times in different engines you know like not necessarily used in a in a in a video but in any case I have this and I wanted to Port it to my new animation engine that I am building so um I drew the scene um so just as a quick update I had this thing called sketch app you can now drag the canvas around um it's a little buggy but there are panels that you can drag around and resize and like dock to various places um you can create a bunch of circles or whatever select them turn them all blue you can align their centers in different ways or you know what not um come on so you you know you can uh say we can make this one come to the front send to back press me send it back bring to front do all that kind of stuff there is a text tool where you can select a text and you can write once I added this dragging thing these little resizers move to the wrong place but you can say you want just to be a font like impact and you want it to be 100 and you want X to be yeah I was uh and then you want the color to be one of these colors up here say ffcc 99 which I always remember and then if you could see the bottom of this uh font of this form you could hit the checkbox and it would loud and whatever you can move around so um a lot of the drawing stuff is there some of it is not great um it's got a little bit of a bug I actually have some work on a line tool which I've not demoed before so this might not uh this is actually a cat mole from fine I'm not sure why it's taking so long to click but anyway and you can take these little pieces and move them around it's a little bit different than a bezier's line because the pieces are you know the points all lineup or rather the points rather the points the the path goes through all the points except for this little virtual point at the start and at the end um so that's pretty cool and actually that I'm not sure if it updates but it it respected my choice of this color um a little bit buggy uh very very early very very sorry early demo of this thing yeah uh not even it's a little it's not Pixel Perfect in grabbing the thing exactly sure why this used to be very readable now it's very dark but is back up here I guess you you can see that it doesn't quite enough anyway so the point is I got drawing tools and I was able to make enough of that scene the scene that I can you know approximate the the look that I wanted to have so um I can actually load that from Json now um so we can load and save to Json you'll notice this doesn't always put the right font in supposed to be cool and Park but it just doesn't uh doesn't pick it up sometimes I'm not entirely sure why that's a bug I'm not sure if it's a bug on my part or just like that but if I kick it enough times it you know you can you can make it work um there's no way to make it bold in the UI yet I think this button that button may or may or may not work but anyway you can get we can approximate the look and feel of the thing actually I think we wanted to I think I also have to make this scene uh I'm sorry set it to a different particular size yeah there we go um then the The Next Step would be to add some animation frames to it now I do have animation in here um animation does work I can create animations and I've kind of refactored a little bit so this is you might have seen this in my earlier videos [Music] so this is all created with code though and even today everything I'm going to be doing is going to be created through code but I want to get a little bit closer to you know uh making this animation the way I want it to work so right now the animation here is a property of this thing the GS player app which used to be called GS animator and you know like it wasn't it's application of itself but not of its own and I factored out this timeline widget so that's shared with the other thing which is the drawing thing which is called a sketch app and uh talking does not that thing does not behave properly when it's undocked it's sort of weird like this too to make it bigger you drag this little resizer down and then it pushes the container up also a little bit silly um but yeah so so the point is that once you you get the the uh tracks and the positions and whatnot in the right place you can do the animations you want to do um but this only works for two properties right now um You can set the position and you can set the rotation you cannot set the size and so I need to set the size to make this little box come down and to expand across the stream screen and I'll need to set a custom property here for making the text come out so you can see that there is some sense of some concept of what a property is uh so this this inspector okay I can bring it over to this side uh has the the font is a little really it's really faint it's really hard to see that but it says ID and then you can give it whatever name you want so I named this uh blue rectangle back here of the stripe text this is not in any order right now and those are the two elements in my scene so those two items are the only things in the scene um it's got a coordinates or a pair of coordinates a point it's got a fill color which is one of these colors from the Arne uh palette and that's about it um yeah and you can serialize this so so the way I'm serializing now you know as I draw whatever I want and then I come down here and I run this piece of code this little snippet right here that just makes a string and then dumps the Json surrounded by single quotes and Json uh is a is generated by actually the same the very same tool that is not this generating this inspector it's called Magritte it's a meta model and basically you describe the objects and the fields and what properties they have and what their labels are and then you can extend it and so you can tell it what the Json key should be or you know I created a thing that lets you tell it what the Json key should be and so when I run this um variable or should I do wrong I don't know what is wrong I think I have something selected maybe uh and you and it can make a Json string for you it's a little hard to read I can make this bigger and uh but then everything else will not be readable [Music] but because I appended this then now it's actually a command that I can copy and paste in into this tool down here and I for now I just have a bunch of things saved that way that I'm kind of working on um I'll show that in a second but basically uh you you say Json GS Json reader GS being the name of this or the code for this framework and then you read this chunk of Json and whatever you get it's you know here's a class here's some fills here's some children here's some text uh you notice um I know it's really hard to parse through all this stuff but the uh the text does not have in fact I bet if you I think if you say this all right if you just do this and we inspect this I think we'll get a Json Oh weird okay well whatever uh if I inspect this it should render as Json and you can get the data uh but doesn't like that so there's some problem with it yeah so it's a little buggy got some issues with the saving and whatnot so I'm still um doing a lot of this where I'm just editing this stuff by hand but you know once you get it this way now [Music] did that save it all right you can't copy it okay well so that's dumb yeah so I gotta fix that I don't want to derail this this whole demo but um I can just get it to parse so the GS Tech shape with wings and then yeah so it's missing that here we go and now we can parse it and we see some actual data um so uh but like it like you can see that this now you can probably see that this is missing the coordinates of the text so it doesn't save that and everything it goes back to the top left so the way this works um and and this is how we're gonna have to extend everything else here is GS text shape uh this is something I made to wrap the you know to adapt the built-in you know editable label concept to um my framework here and we can browse it a little bit we can see this area is a bunch of stuff these should actually be um Google doesn't agreed um but so these descriptions are uh are descriptions of the fields I guess I picked a bad example because [Music] all right all right so and then we have to refresh the scene I made this thing and it's not it's very very much a work in progress this little browser thing but but you can get these examples and you basically you create um on each as as instance methods you create a description for the fields in your in your class and so [Music] um you can annotate methods with these things called pragmas in in pharaoh and uh then you can query for all the things with that with that annotation so then you can make a view like this that shows you know show me all the things with that um with that annotation uh and up here these are things that we've that I've added to the the overall Graphics framework so [Music] you notice there is no place to put a position and that was because I was experimenting with the uh notion of having the circle like be positioned from its Center and something else being positioned from from elsewhere so um if we want to add a point for the text at the moment what we're going to do and maybe this will change we got to find the text shape and we have to make a new method and I just copied that message over from the the circle shape so I would say I'm just going to call this XY description or let's say position description um it's interesting that Circle does not have a Json key either so I think that was actually foreign yes yeah so I haven't done this yet the idea is that we can uh I didn't know how to extend Magritte to allow um allow Json keys but so give me a second here we're going to call this position GS position and we're going to call this position the GS position wraps the block stuff and then um a wrapper for that so now we look at the make great descriptions here we have a position description and somewhere in here yeah we have to wrap this if we want to give it a Json key this is not the way you're supposed to do this um is it not even saving the text it does GS text oh because right so so if the accessor is simple enough then you can just set you you can just tell it an accessor right um and then by default there's just taking that access sort of be the yeah okay so so then if I if if I were to do this right now again I'd have to um I'm not sure I think I have to restart the whole thing SketchUp let's load this of this one and then we'll export the text again it's not going to be right but now you can see it has a GS position GS position is wrong uh because it wasn't saving where I wanted it to save before um all right but now we have that thing um well um so my intent is to use that exact same system for the Json uh generation the inspector so this should say now that we've added that that should have a position field in here I haven't specified what order they should be in and it's not like truncating the formatting these numbers very nicely but it's there [Music] um I think if I accept this and then if I if I dump this out now I would expect that to be truncated a little bit but but it's not being truncated in the form here I truncated to three decimal places uh in the in the Json output anywhere else anyway so um you know this is all corrupt still so I'm not going to worry about that right now um the point is that uh I've got a bunch of features in here um and this thing Magritte this meta model is that I've just been demonstrating is what is what is powering the Json description it's both the reader and the writer and the inspector and I wanted to power the the animator uh but we're not quite there yet uh because before I knew about I made the animator before I learned about my greet um and like uh you know I looked into Magritte thinking that hey you know this might be this might do what it is that I'm trying to build because I had pictured this you know this sort of system where um but right so I made some design decisions that it turns out I could have done a little bit differently uh so for example the uh if I look at that GS text again uh lots of places where lost track of where it is but she has text shape and we look at some agreed descriptions uh that we are inherited uh you see I've added stuff to BL element and some of the other things I've added to uh PL elements like if I if I search here and I say package yeah and I say um my package name so you can extend any any object uh with what's called extension methods uh so they live in Europe oh sorry so so yeah so there the tag is with the star and then the name of the pack uh but so I've added all these things like GS bottom and GS Center that allow me to directly manipulate the position of any of any object of any visible object of any element right it's like the the core object in Block um the in you know the the position accessor in um uh in this Fork a block is not metric you you read it with position but you set it with relocate uh because because generally most of the time elements do not set their own position they're they're positioned by whatever container they're in uh but in my in my in my case here uh you know we do want we you know you are the author and you are drawing a picture in so you want to put things where you want to put them and so so objects do need to know their their position and that has to be something that's um serialized so it's still a little messy like these things they have some State associated with them when so when you set the position you can't just immediately read it right and so there needs to be uh there needs to be to be some some work done with that um but I'm not going to get into that I I've been rambling and showing like showing off stuff I I want to get into a little bit of actual coding and then probably wrap this up pretty early it's not going to be an eight hour stream um okay so bottom line is that I I basically copied and pasted this cleaned it up somewhere and I I've now stuck it in a uh thing called GS animator examples examples are meant to be something like a test Suite uh so but but that return a result and that can be chained together and put assertions in here I don't have any assertions but this little green box means that no assertions were you know failed during the Run of this last time it was run um so here we go here's the the scene as it was saved here um still it's not bold I don't know why sometimes I don't know if I can get it to be bold you can see it's not even the same font every time and that's a little weird um I don't know what to do about that um I can put a position in here now if I want and so I can put this at the position that it was in uh here so uh the position of the label never moves the label never moves it's always at this position which is which is form 128 and 254. so position so GS position uh and it's always in a circle and it has an app sign in the middle and it was 128. at what 128 at 254. now I have no idea if the uh if the coordinate system in Godot like where text is looks like the Anchor Point is up on the top left and I think that's going to be the same for for this and the size of this is fonts well that doesn't seem right no font size 120 pixels right okay and also this is 100 if I make this uh you know you you know uses a lot of screen real estate yeah so this is how big it should be and this is rendered at um 1080p which is the size of the entire that doesn't seem right yeah oh and yeah okay so yeah yeah so so when it when it's rendered in real time it actually scales the window because this is this is the size of renders that I don't know why it's not showing so the the full size of this one it it's not set to trigger that animation so I guess it rescales it to whatever the size should be so it's gonna look something about the size so so so probably that's about twice as big as it should be and so so the font size should be 64. set at 128 right now and it's probably for a 4K screen and it should be scaled down in half oops that didn't work uh it's because I'm missing a comma right there for the world okay I'm gonna make my screen huge for just a second because I want to see yeah um so I don't know if you can see that now but it looks like that's where the where it should be uh and that looks about right when you have when you can see the whole screen it looks about right I cannot scale this um so I I or I guess I can scale it but yeah I guess if you oh interesting um not sure what to say about that uh so this is actually set at uh not sure why I'm not sure why it's size that way I've seen uh size scene extend that was sent to no or this is the scene so it's self-exting okay whatever I don't know why it's that size I guess because I haven't told it any size and it's just matching the parent um but because I'm I'm on a smaller screen right now I'm going to try and set this to uh uh so we're gonna say scene uh seeing extend or scenes size 800 at 600. this is just for for testing once I have the ability to zoom these things that's gonna make a big difference wow this failed that because of invalid input but if we just ran it didn't we did I break something again confused I don't know all right again you can see if you look at the font you can really tell that it's like like this is the default font for GT and this is the font I want except I want it to be bold and this is being ignored so I don't know I think like if I just run this now if I just do this no child named text it found then you know do key equals now and I have no idea why that doesn't work just some kind of risk condition so I'm gonna ignore this I'm gonna ignore the font for now that's something let's see for later so this works all right so now the now the question is we need to wrap it and give it a a player so scenes should be my head's in the way isn't it seems should be should have this this text should have this ability to animate themselves uh but I didn't start out that way I didn't start out putting the animation on the scene I I built it from the UI out and so the UI is what contains the animation at the moment uh and so I did factor out this um this little guy that's what I did is I just you know I I took the self you know I took this example and now I'm calling it and I'm making a new player app that has this scene and the player app has this animation tool built into it this panel right here and then we're adding a track for the strike position and I just went through before the stream started and I copied the uh the what do you call them the keyframes the keyframe values from here manually um it's a little bit different Godot is timed in terms of or you know specified in terms of time because you have a variable frames per second based on you know how well the engine is running um whereas here I'm trying at least in my current way of thinking I'm going to have specific frames per second and Target a very specific frame rate which is 24 frames per second or 30 frames per second or whatever I think uh I think my YouTube videos are generally 30 frames per second which is really all you need unless you're like doing you know games or something uh okay so yeah so that's that's coming in right nice but you can see and and it does line up and um I think if that were both that would probably look about right um let me make the funnel a little bit bigger I don't think my and then if I run this and when we bring this down here [Music] I do want to get uh panning and zooming here zooming is built into um you know you can the zooming framework is already there in this system you can scale everything um but uh just as the the text was you know getting out of a sync with its its bounding box uh I'd have to I I did I did some work to address that and I have the same work to address scaling and so uh I don't want to click on something and then have the you know it's huge and it's going to have these little tiny control points right so I need to I need to fix that oh that's interesting yeah you can see this is this is where it's from here so you have this same problem if I scaled it uh so I just haven't haven't set that up yet that's on my list to do soon because then I'll be able to zoom in and out and see the whole scene with the mouse wheel um Okay so but so anyway I've added this now so I this worked this worked just great um and it's just in the wrong place it really needs to be part of the scene so that I can serialize it for one um and and so all this is you add a track for the stripe so it's a you know the first thing is what is the name of the thing you're doing so that's why I gave it a name up here has an ID called striped what is the name of the shape you are animating the second one is what is the property on there animating all right so the way this works oh so then we'll see this and this will not work adding size does not work and as soon as I move this I'm gonna get a bunch of Errors so GS Prop class is not in indexable um uh and so that has to do with the word size is used to indicate like the size of an array um and so that it's complaining that it's not an array right in small talk that's the convention that's what that's what the word size usually means it's overwritten you mean something else now I believe I can say oh no I can't right so if I say GS size uh that's not going to save me at all right it's not gonna work but it might do something different we'll do something different yeah it says it does not understand GSX which is what it was trying to say before but but size was defined for object so it inherited that okay um yeah object is overloaded with so many things that uh I I I personally would not have so many things on object but 50 year old language evolution of the 50 year old language okay so for a slot name on object GS prop perform a slot name and so what this is let's actually load it up here rather than in the debugger so we say GS spot with any luck I describe a point but that's actually GS Point description I I yeah what did I say IGS but it's not the word was it his prop is the word I don't know I got the words all right so this was my first take at something like uh this meta model thing I tried to make it look a little bit like Magritte using this right too and so on there's also thing called slots in in Pharaoh itself um but right now we have we have properties for a position and what it does is it says oh interesting how does this work ah I see so the word creating this was not I didn't think this out very well all right because it's on the class side so if we look at the um class side objects we filter down to the class side object you can see it yeah position and rotation are the only two ones that are defined and if we want to add a new one like size which I think is what we're going to call it uh then we need to have a GS uh size problem and then we need to create that class and so that's going to be a type of GS prompt GS prop and it is getting that thing and then save it and we'll just copy whatever that does all right so look at what the rotation prop does and so so rotate rotation is not a property in uh in in this framework it's not just an angle but I want to imagine that it's an angle and so I said a Target transform rotate by a degree value of y so this is what you have to do is you have to take that element you get it to transform you call rotate buy and then you apply it so you can do all kinds of things with the transform more than just rotating position same thing uh actually this one right so so by default read hmm what does he get oh anyway yeah because we're not reading them right you need to read when you're setting when you're creating the keyframes and I I'm doing it all by hand right now so this read is not just implemented yet and we won't need it for tonight so all I need to do is implement this one method uh right here in size prop and you know I was not necessarily thinking that this would only be for shapes at when I originally made it so it doesn't say whatever uh but it really should be a shape and so we're going to write a a size to a shape which is really a point I'm going to say a shape and we're going to say gsis uh so right so so now okay well that does not exist so anywhere in the GSX tent I just don't have an access for this uh okay so size whatever so these are very simple like they're originally called Setters and then when I realized I need to read things too and then then I started calling it props and then I realized well Magritte does this and maybe um whatever so when you uh they're also tied to handles like the index prop at index prompt this is used by the handles to move to uh the handles in a path to move the point at that index in the path right you know like it's a collection it's a list of points and then you just generate one for each point in the in the index and you can read and write so read actually does work here and I guess for this one because this one actually needs to read it to generate the handle the size prop I guess could do the same so and so if we want to read a a shape then we say a shape at we just say something or I guess extent uh you cannot write the extent for the similar reasons to why you cannot call the uh I'm going to say it's deprecated and you should use size instead um so yeah I don't really like this system but that should work and if we copy this class and and we say well let's just say GS selector problem right I'm thinking ahead to the uh selector prop and we're going to give it a selector see this is this is looking very very much like um a symbol uh like the way um agreed Works mcgreet has this whole notion of things called accessors and they have re-selectors right selectors a symbol but I'm going to just do this uh so read elector is equal to a symbol and we'll make that a property of this and so basically you're going to configure this by giving it a selector to read and select your right right selector symbol I don't think I actually saved read select yeah I didn't save it so lead selector and then I saved the instance variable but I didn't save the method so now that if you just rename things and then save it again you get a copy I have to actually right click and say like rename message to accurate okay so so this is going to be for the the text going across the screen and um I am running low on time here but I'm going to just kind of wrap this up so I might actually just I don't have I don't have the thing right so let's just do the extent this this should work now so if I have a gsi's prop then I have to go into gsrop and I have to say [Music] um of size so I do I do have that and then if I want to add uh with selectors so read a reader a read selector and write a write selection I know I'm getting a little bit of my head of myself here but we will say return GS what do they call it uh yes accessor prop this selector prop selector prop new and then we're going to say read selector a read selector and write selector a and right and so this is called a Cascade it's a semicolon there so it's going to send all these messages to that one object it's going to update itself and and each one of them the final result if you don't return anything is to return the object itself okay so that's that's all set um and so then I oh right and then this one I I read and write in eight shapes size um definitely needs to be merged with the Magritte support for points but whatever and then this one we can where's the other one I made that was the I'm almost done sweetie I'll be out in a little while okay okay I probably gotta wrap this up but I really want to see something on the screen so right selector right to read select or read two and then we're going to say oh right so this is not how we do this so we have to say perform is it arguments argument you say perform with arguments and then we're gonna say a size nope it's not this is we're gonna say perform right selector so bottom right selector with arguments a size and then to read it we're going to perform a uh reset comment which so now I could I could implement this with uh I could use this to replace all these things well not the rotation because the rotation is complicated not the indexing because that's complicated I'm going to give myself a 10 more minutes and then we'll try and wrap this up uh so anyway so I think some of these could be replaced with with this one it's more General and also uh all the whole thing could probably be replaced with Negrete in the future but I'm just I just want to get this on the screen right now all right so I've added this uh this is called size so this is the symbol that's passed to GS prop to tell it um oh okay so this should work yeah so now we've got this it it grows and it expands I like that um and so now to do the text we need to add the lengths here and so length shown I have to add that as a uh as a selector I'm almost done sweetie give me a couple minutes okay and then um I need to add this to be uh GS prompt so if I say I create a method called blank shown and this has to be on the class because it's a Constructor for for the class we're going to say we're going to return GS selector prop new and read selector right selector okay I'm just I'm just making a video I'll be almost I'm almost done okay the recollector is uh I have to implement this and right selector is length shown and I have to add this to the text right so we have to add this to GS Tech shape we have to add both of those accessors and so we can say uh length shown is here and then uh click this to commit that this is also in the Greek form so they're using that to describe the objects and generate the forms uh internally in in glamorous toolkit here and so we create accessors and so those should have added two uh two new but we're only looking at descriptions we want to look here we look under accessing we should see length shown um and so when we do this we need to reject rate this is a number actually so a number and then we're going to self redecorate which is to redraw the text uh and when we redraw the text uh font size size font size and then right sorry so we say so text color is self text color font size is the font size I don't know why text color is oh because it's a function you have to we don't I don't want to duplicate that function call uh and then I lost my place here just like chattering away out there I think it's bedtime for them it's usually an hour later you know school has started so uh my schedule's a bit off all right so I'm almost done with this and then we're gonna say uh uh text shoot okay so I have to do this I have to say um I have to say full text full string all right so when we set this all right so first of all in the initialization this should be called it should be to be in initializing uh x equals new text right so it calls that that's good so text I gotta get this listening for changes but um yes now we have initial ization here oops so in initialization we're calling text and then from text we say we can say self we'll just say full string equals a string and super text equals a string let's do this uh I don't think this is going to be something we're all right so so uh like shown like shown equals eight string size again and then what do we need to do at when we call that setter bring this back down here in the accessor for that thing the length shown so in when we recall redecorate uh not size super text because we don't want to use R text it can be full oh sorry I think we have to start over because we need the text first because then we you can't decorate the text until it's there so self is full string foreign how do you say this banana you know whatever I'm almost done guys come on give me like a couple more seconds okay five more minutes how do you find the first part of a string comparing accessing substring is called substring now I'm gonna look up on Google here take the first and I know you can do this I know I put a string in pharaoh you do it okay copy from text full string copy from one two and we have to wrap this whole thing because it thinks it's all one message so we can wrap this from there copy from to uh uh length clean title animation nope not this this is garbage animation nope it's over here gotta find this example again so animated text run this again it should work now oh no does not understand title animate position and size oh because it doesn't understand this battle card anime animated position and title card not without not the word scene okay let me run this uh no we don't need this we don't need the GS player anymore because we already have it um right now we have three tracks yes ah there we go hello world ah out of bounds 14. okay we're almost done we're almost there what was this yes two full string size max length shown copy from thank you X yes that's all we needed to do we just need to check that balance condition and then oh [Music] okay crop you want from to protect I want to admin not Max and here's my thing going ah come on I'm like seconds away from you can't see my screen I have this problem on my phone where I can't see the screen come on okay super text length shown equals zero okay it's true and we're gonna set the text to empty if false then full string copy from min of that and then this is save it and this should work yes animator examples we run it and hello world"
