There are roughly 4.3 billion planets that were initially evenly distributed across stars, so each star started with 65,000 planets. In the long-run Urbit developers believe $10 to be a fair price for a planet. Assuming that the price eventually converges to $10 per planet and Urbit achieves widespread adoption, then each star is worth $650k in planet real estate alone. Planets are also expected to pay a monthly fee to their stars for routing services (which is the bare minimum service; the star may choose to offer services as well). This fee is estimated to be anywhere from $10–$100 per month."
