How great is the danger of military conflict?\n\nI have been involved in U.S.-China relations for about 40 years. Now, for the first time, I am seriously concerned. Because the danger of escalation is great. China has become more powerful and more determined in pursuing its interests. In doing so, it is also prepared to take calculated risks. And since 2017, the U.S. has been providing strategic responses, for example by forming the military pact with Australia and the United Kingdom. All this increases the likelihood of a military conflict between the US and China as a result of an incident or accident."

The rivalry between the two superpowers will remain, but system competition can be managed, as history shows. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union developed a set of rules to prevent a catastrophe. A crisis as dangerous as the one in 1962 never happened again afterwards - despite intense competition between the two systems. Such a common set of rules is needed today between the U.S. and China.\n\n"

If President Xi Jinping remains in power, China is likely to try to annex Taiwan in the late 2020s or early 2030s. By then, China's military will be much stronger and its economy more resilient in the event of international sanctions."

Russia's war of aggression, however, has changed everything. The West must now stick together. Europe has to decide whether it will side with the U.S. and Asia's democracies and actively defend the West's values against China's authoritarianism. But as soon as Ukraine disappears from the headlines, Europe runs the risk of \"strategic amnesia,\" as the Chinese say. And when European corporations like VW see great opportunities in China again, the Europeans will return to normal economic relations. That is the deep conviction of the Chinese.\n\n"

They fear democratic color revolutions allegedly orchestrated by the U.S. - which could destabilize their countries. The common enemy is the USA; together they can achieve more. They want to restructure the world order. For example, they want to decouple international law from UN norms."

        "text": "What is Europe's role in the systemic struggle in the Indo-Pacific?\n\nBefore the Ukraine war, there was a debate in Europe about strategic autonomy. Russia's war of aggression, however, has changed everything. The West must now stick together. Europe has to decide whether it will side with the U.S. and Asia's democracies and actively defend the West's values against China's authoritarianism. But as soon as Ukraine disappears from the headlines, Europe runs the risk of \"strategic amnesia,\" as the Chinese say. And when European corporations like VW see great opportunities in China again, the Europeans will return to normal economic relations. That is the deep conviction of the Chinese.\n\n"
