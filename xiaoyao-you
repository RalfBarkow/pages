You can indicate the capacity to be highly attentive to one’s surroundings, as animals are, or to learn in a nonstrenuous and potentially spontaneous way, as children can. It can also refer to the social ease among people that we experience when engaged in an intellectually stimulating or emotionally enjoyable conversation among friends. "

Such contentment can sometimes be found through an approach to identity where one neither overcommits to nor shuns away from enacting one’s social personas—a state meditation masters might refer to as “calm emotional detachment.” You implies the paradoxical flexibility both to critically subvert the ethos of a socially enforced identity and to enjoy having it. Exactly how this is possible under conditions of profilicity remains to be seen. A contemporary version of the tale of the naked scribe has not yet been written."
