Aesthetics expressed as art inspires—produces an unwillingness to settle for what we have and a desire for something better. It is both the producer and product of cre­ative activity—change; it is essential for continuous devel­opment. Art also entertains and recreates, yielding fun in what we do, regardless of why we do it. It is the satisfaction we derive from \"going there\" in contrast to the satisfaction derived from \"getting there.\" Recreation provides \"the pause that refreshes.\" It recreates creators. We would not be able to maintain continuous pursuit of ideals without payoffs along the way. But how does all this relate to leadership?"
