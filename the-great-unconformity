When you load the crust with weight (mountains, sediments, ice) the crust sinks into the mantle (basins like the one on my sketch do this) and when you erode or remove weight the crust slowly rebounds, bringing deep rocks to the surface. Therefore, the principle of isostasy is key in both deep burial and massive uplift. "
