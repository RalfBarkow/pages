Moreover, they evidenced a number of clear plans for books. Examination of his entire extant corpus brought to light another unexpected feature: for all their universality the notebooks are focussed on a surprisingly small number of basic themes: crucial among these are his studies of transformational geometry and a mechanical approach to nature, which uses as a point of departure his concept of four powers (weight, force, motion and percussion), and serves ultimately to integrate both his study of the microcosm (anatomy) and the macrocosm (astronomy) within a single grand plan. It was shown that these studies were guided by a distinct method of listing variables systematically and playing with them experimentally. It was claimed that the results of this enterprise inspired him to write treatises and led him to make serious plans for publication."
