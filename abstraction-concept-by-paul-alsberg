      "text": "As with language, it is again the sense organs that are switched off. But with the concept the liberation from the natural limitation of the sense organs is essentially different. The (concrete) word eliminates the sense organs with respect to the perception of a single object, the (abstract) concept with respect to the perception of all objects connected by a common characteristic. The concept is consequently the more comprehensive tool, for which reason it has also pushed back the \"concrete\" word in the language use more and more. But despite the developmental connection of the concept to the \"word\" and the conceptual character of our language, the difference in essence between word and concept is always noticeable: Where a word refers to a single specific object, it takes the place of this object and conveys a vivid idea of it; where, on the other hand, a word appears as a \"concept,\" it takes the place of all objects encompassed by the concept and is not vivid. In the extraordinary achievement of the concepts, to transfer all the incoherent, manifold, incalculable within the nature meaningfully into order, unity, control, the enormous material superiority of all artificial tools over the physical possibilities asserts itself again."

      "text": "That the concept, although it can only be thought, is therefore not a \"psychic\" (bodily-functional) experience, but rather an artificial, extracorporeal structure, should not cause any more difficulties for the understanding after our same-sense explanations about the nature of language. Above all, we have to distinguish sharply also here between the finished concepts as \"tools\" and the formation and operation of the concepts as bodily-functional performances. The \"raw material\" for the concepts (idea of the objects and their common characteristic) again originates from our brain function, is therefore of \"mental\" kind and characterizes the concept equally as a mental tool. The formation of the concepts (abstraction) as well as their \"operation\", namely all those mental activities, by which the concepts are transferred into higher concepts or are connected to judgments or are subjected to the conclusion procedure, are also based on Gehimfunktion. But also the thinking of the concepts belongs to their \"operation\" (analogously as in the language the \"speaking\" of the word). The already pre-existing concept is not formed by the thinking of it, but only put into action. It is the spirit, which sets the tools built up by itself for the fulfillment of its purpose performance into activity. A concept that is not thought is like a word that is not spoken, or like a hammer that is not used: all three of them are \"tools\", i.e. means for the liberation of the body, and as such in constant readiness, but without their mere possibility for the elimination of the body also already being put into action. Only when the hammer is swung, the word spoken, the concept thought, do they go into action as tools. This is in itself a self-evident fact, but in the case of the \"concept\" it needs a special emphasis, so that the \"thinking\" of the concept (certainly a \"psychic experience\", but still nothing more than its \"operation\") is not taken for the concept itself and thus its tool nature is misjudged."

However, as we have seen, this does not in the least affect the tool nature of the finished concept, but rather becomes the determining factor only for the specific kind of its performance."

Doch ist beim Begriff die Befreiung von der Naturbeschränktheit der Sinnesorgane eine wesentlich andre. Das (konkrete) Wort schaltet die Sinnesorgane hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmung eines einzelnen Gegenstands aus, der (abstrakte) Begriff hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmung aller, durch ein gemeinsames Merkmal verbundener Gegenstände. Der Begriff ist mithin das umfassendere Werkzeug, aus welchem Grund er auch das „konkrete\" Wort im Sprachgebrauch mehr und mehr zurückgedrängt hat. Aber trotz der entwicklungsgeschichtlichen Bindung des Begriffs an das „Wort\" und des begrifflich gewordenen Charakters unsrer Sprache ist der Wesensunterschied zwischen Wort und Begriff stets feststellbar: Wo ein Wort sich auf einen einzelnen bestimmten Gegenstand bezieht, da tritt es an die Stelle dieses Gegenstands und vermittelt eine anschauliche Vorstellung desselben; wo hingegen ein Wort als „Begriff\" auftritt, da setzt es sich an die Stelle aller vom Begriff umfaßten Gegenstände und ist unanschaulich. In der außerordentlichen Leistung der Begriffe, all das Unzusammenhängende, Mannigfaltige, Unübersehbare innerhalb der Natur sinnvoll in Ordnung, Einheit, Beherrschung überzuführen, macht sich wiederum die gewaltige materielle Überlegenheit aller künstlichen Werkzeuge über die körperlichen Möglichkeiten geltend.\n"

Vor allem müssen wir auch hier scharf zwischen den fertigen Begriffen als „Werkzeugen\" und der Bildung und Bedienung der Begriffe als körperlich-funktionellen Leistungen unterscheiden. Das „Rohmaterial\" zu den Begriffen (Vorstellung der Objekte und ihres gemeinsamen Merkmals) entstammt wiederum unserer Gehimfunktion, ist demnach „geistiger\" Art und charakterisiert den Begriff gleicherweise als ein geistiges Werkzeug. Auf Gehimfunktion beruht auch die Bildung der Begriffe (Abstraktion) sowie ihre „Bedienung\", nämlich alle jene geistigen Tätigkeiten, durch welche die Begriffe in höhere Begriffe übergeführt oder zu Urteilen verknüpft oder dem Schlußverfahren unterworfen werden. Aber auch das Denken der Begriffe gehört mit zu ihrer „Bedienung\" (analog wie in der Sprache das „Sprechen\" des Wortes). Wird doch der schon vorher existierende Begriff durch das Denken desselben nicht erst gebildet, sondern lediglich in Aktion gesetzt. Es ist der Geist, welcher die von ihm selbst aufgebauten Werkzeuge zur Erfüllung ihrer Zweckleistung in Tätigkeit setzt. Ein Begriff, der nicht gedacht wird, ist wie ein Wort, das nicht gesprochen, oder wie ein Hammer, der nicht benützt wird: sie alle drei sind „Werkzeuge\", d. h. Mittel zur Körperbefreiung, und als solche in ständiger Bereitschaft, ohne daß aber ihre bloße Möglichkeit zur Körperausschaltung auch schon in die Tat umgesetzt würde. Erst wenn der Hammer geschwungen, das Wort gesprochen, der Begriff gedacht wird, treten sie als Werkzeuge in Aktion. Dies ist an sich ein selbstverständlicher Sachverhalt, bedarf aber beim „Begriff\" einer besondem Hervorhebung, damit nicht das „Denken\" des Begriffs (gewiß ein „psychisches Erlebnis\", aber doch nichts weiter als seine „Bedienung\") für den Begriff selber gehalten und dadurch seine Werkzeugnatur verkannt wird.\n"

        "text": "That the concept, although it can only be thought, is therefore not a \"psychic\" (bodily-functional) experience, but rather an artificial, extracorporeal structure, should not cause any more difficulties for the understanding after our same-sense explanations about the nature of language. Above all, we have to distinguish sharply also here between the finished concepts as \"tools\" and the formation and operation of the concepts as bodily-functional performances. The \"raw material\" for the concepts (idea of the objects and their common characteristic) again originates from our brain function, is therefore of \"mental\" kind and characterizes the concept equally as a mental tool. The formation of the concepts (abstraction) as well as their \"operation\", namely all those mental activities, by which the concepts are transferred into higher concepts or are connected to judgments or are subjected to the conclusion procedure, are also based on Gehimfunktion. But also the thinking of the concepts belongs to their \"operation\" (analogously as in the language the \"speaking\" of the word). The already pre-existing concept is not formed by the thinking of it, but only put into action. It is the spirit, which sets the tools built up by itself for the fulfillment of its purpose performance into activity. A concept that is not thought is like a word that is not spoken, or like a hammer that is not used: all three of them are \"tools\", i.e. means for the liberation of the body, and as such in constant readiness, but without their mere possibility for the elimination of the body also already being put into action. Only when the hammer is swung, the word spoken, the concept thought, do they go into action as tools. This is in itself a self-evident fact, but in the case of the \"concept\" it needs a special emphasis, so that the \"thinking\" of the concept (certainly a \"psychic experience\", but still nothing more than its \"operation\") is not taken for the concept itself and thus its tool nature is misjudged."
