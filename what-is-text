This is not to say that markup and theories of markup must be \"subjective.\" (It is also not to say – see below – that they must not be subjective.) It is to say that they are and must be social, historical, and dialectical, and that some forms have greater range and power than others, and that some are useful exactly because they seek to limit and restrict their range for certain special purposes.
