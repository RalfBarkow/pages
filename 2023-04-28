This authentication is highly simplified and does not require maintaining a database of users.

You are correct that Tor Project does maintain a public list of known exit node IP addresses, which is regularly updated.\n\nTo access this list, you can go to the following URL:\n\nhttps://check.torproject.org/exit-addresses\n\nThis page lists all the currently known exit nodes, along with their IP addresses, the date and time they were last seen, and their country of origin. It is worth noting that this list is not exhaustive, and not all exit nodes may be included in it.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned earlier, publishing a list of exit node IP addresses goes against the privacy and anonymity principles of the Tor network. Therefore, I would still caution against using this list for any purpose that might undermine the security and privacy of the network or its users."

        "text": "On FreedomBox, Coturn provides both STUN and TURN servers. Both services are provided over TCP as well as UDP. They are provided on unencrypted as well as encrypted channels (which have a higher chance of success). Since STUN servers are very inexpensive and don't consume a lot of server resources, there is no authentication needed to use them. TURN servers on the other hand need authentication. This authentication is highly simplified and does not require maintaining a database of users. A server such as matrix-synapse which is about to setup an audio/video call between two peers will generate a username and password using a shared secret. When the peers use the TURN server, they will be validated using these credentials because the TURN server also knows the same secret. "

An Experiment in Live Collaborative Programming on the Croquet Shared Experience Platform. In: Companion Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on the Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming. Online. New York, NY, USA: Association for Computing Machinery. 8 December 2022. p. 46–53. [Accessed 28 April 2023]. Programming ’22. ISBN 978-1-4503-9656-1. DOI 10.1145/3532512.3535224. This paper describes our experiences in building a live collaborative programming environment on top of the JavaScript version of the Croquet shared experience platform. Croquet provides a clean substrate for building real-time collaborative applications. We created an application framework that supports live programming, and used that framework to build the Greenlight collaborative application, then in turn, modified it to do live programming experiments. The environment allows multiple users to modify the running application from within, with changes taking effect immediately. The experiment was inspired by earlier work including Douglas Engelbart’s oN-Line System (NLS) and the Kansas system in Self. Analogically, the system is like the Smalltalk environment made collaborative. In this paper we explain the Croquet architecture, its library and framework, and the Greenlight application used to make the live programming environment. The standard version of Greenlight is available at https://croquet.io/greenlight, and the modified demo system is available at https://croquet.io/scripting.\n"
