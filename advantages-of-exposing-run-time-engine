Syntax is more than simple text parsing, it's a representation of a feature, and those features aren't common to all languages, and can't simply be translated from one syntax to the next. For example, Visual Basic has no concept of closures, anonymous functions, or even first class functions, so you can't just trivially translate Lisp or Smalltalk to VB, you'd have to fake a ton of non-existent features first. C doesn't have objects - same problem, you have to fake the feature first, to even attempt a translation. The whole reason a language is created in the first place is to express an idea or feature in a way that existing languages don't. People have tried this before and continue to fail. If there were a bunch of languages that could all be expressed via a generic meta-syntax, they'd be fairly worthless as languages, since they don't offer anything unique anyway. ",

Perhaps \"exposing\" is not quite the right term because many dynamic languages already offer ways to \"see\" internal (and sometimes change) structures if you know enough about the language. I am simply suggesting that the same access be done by treating the internals like a data structure instead of using peculiar syntax to access it. <b>Thus, I am not necessarily suggesting more access, just more comfortable access.</b> This implies that I think data-structure-like or DB-like access is superior than syntactical approaches to the same info, which is basically true.

Syntax is more than simple text parsing, it's a representation of a feature, and those features aren't common to all languages, and can't simply be translated from one syntax to the next. For example, Visual Basic has no concept of closures, anonymous functions, or even first class functions, so you can't just trivially translate Lisp or Smalltalk to VB, you'd have to fake a ton of non-existent features first. C doesn't have objects - same problem, you have to fake the feature first, to even attempt a translation. The whole reason a language is created in the first place is to express an idea or feature in a way that existing languages don't. People have tried this before and continue to fail. If there were a bunch of languages that could all be expressed via a generic meta-syntax, they'd be fairly worthless as languages, since they don't offer anything unique anyway. ",
