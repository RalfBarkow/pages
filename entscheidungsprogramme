Decision programs define conditions of factual correctness of decisions. This does not mean (or only in the limiting case) that decisions can be obtained by way of logical deduction. Even if they are \"conditional programs\" in the sense to be discussed in a moment, often indeterminate terms that need interpretation in the situation play a role. Moreover, programmed decision-making is typically guided by contextual memories, so that one may fall back on the original meaning of the program when deviations seem reasonable. Despite these ambivalences, indeed precisely thanks to the elasticity they provide, the factual reference to programs in organizations normally also stands for social acceptance. It may be that a decision program is accompanied by the instruction to report anomalies or suspicions that might speak against the program; but this then almost amounts to paradoxical programming – it may or may not be right – and generally has little effect."
