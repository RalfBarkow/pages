I hate it. I feel we gain so much by showing who else is present, \"where\" they are, and what they are doing. I feel that this is one of the great distinctions of 3D (virtual worlds and XR), but can also be done for 2D (e.g., circular head-shot avatars in the margins next to the paragraph you have selected).\nHowever, doing this across worlds involves some design problems. For one, I don't know how to indicate presence in a world that you're not actually in:\n- A ghost? Hidden behind the portal that you can't see, with a laser beam passing through the portal, prompting you to stop what you're doing to walk around the portal to more clearly see who is there? A ghost on a higher layer so that you see it from behind the portal, but also see others layered on top in a confusing jumble? (I've done some seeing-through-walls stuff, and I think maybe David also has done so for the military.) And that would indicate spatial location which is kind of meaningless i this case, yet fail to indicate which world they are in, which is important.\n- Maybe limit portals to only be two-way and 1:1, so that the people in the other world looking back can see the users of one and only one world through the portal at them? Do you require the door to be open from both sides when allowing interaction?\nNow, what about audio? How do you communicate with the people reaching through the portal to mess you up?\nI think it's fascinating to try to solve these issues, and maybe we should establish such conventions now, while we can. It's certainly fun to try. I truly do not know if the effort and risk pulls its weight, especially given the technical issues to overcome as well. But what really gives me pause is the responsibility against creating opportunities for harming other users. Spooky action at a distance isn't just confusing, it can be dangerous.\n"
