Of the fact that the art imitates the nature, can be here therefore not at all the speech. But also the visible figures, which meet us in the imagination, in the dream or in the pictorial memory, never have a rectangular frame around them, which made them only to pictures. In this the figures of our imagination resemble the cave paintings of the Palaeolithic Age. Neither in the free nature nor in our imaginative imagination, therefore, is a picture surface of rectangular form at home. So when, where and how did we come to have them in the first place? And what does the process of their formation and shaping teach us about them, and about us? These are the questions [[Manfred Sommer]] explores in the descriptions and reflections of this book."

Of the fact that the art imitates the nature, can be here therefore not at all the speech. But also the visible figures, which meet us in the imagination, in the dream or in the pictorial memory, never have a rectangular frame around them, which made them only to pictures. In this the figures of our imagination resemble the cave paintings of the Palaeolithic Age. Neither in the free nature nor in our imaginative imagination, therefore, is a picture surface of rectangular form at home. So when, where and how did we come to have them in the first place? And what does the process of their formation and shaping teach us about them, and about us? These are the questions [[Manfred Sommer]] explores in the descriptions and reflections of this book."

While a humanities scholar can in many cases (but not all) do his or her work in the [[Library]] of another university (and, as a consequence of the [[digitisation]] of texts, perhaps in any other place in the future), a much more restrictive location constraint arises for the natural and technical scientist in the form of attachment to \"his or her\" [[Laboratory]]. One can easily see this in the fact that the \"Centres of Advanced Studies\" that are emerging worldwide are predominantly institutions of the humanities and social sciences, because only in these disciplines are the necessary mobilities possible. -- [[ICT influence on teaching and research]]"

This paper investigates the effect of attending immigrant-dense schools on student outcomes, which consists of the joint effect of immigrant peers and school context. The sorting of students into schools is not random, and a large immigrant peer effect literature uses school fixed effects to eliminate selection bias. However, keeping schools fixed also eliminates the effect of the school context and is accordingly unsuited to estimate the total effect of attending immigrant-dense schools. By using both a value-added approach and by drawing on application data to manage selection bias, this paper demonstrates that attending immigrant-dense upper secondary schools in Norway increases student dropout, even though a school fixed effects model indicates no detectable immigrant peer effects.

        "text": "The meritocracy, which today often has negative connotations, in which a person's social position (and perhaps even his or her worth) depends on his or her own ability and performance, is a child of modernity. The meritocratic promise in modern societies enables the realistic dream of improving one's status through effort, diligence, and talent, and climbing the social ladder accordingly. It opens the way to a social structure legitimized far from castes and estates. Stairs and (later) elevators have been built into the social shell over the last 200 years. However, the idea that everyone can be the architect of his or her own fortune through talent, diligence and performance proves to be empirically uninformed upon closer examination. On the one hand, there are findings that attest to measurable deficits in the education system with regard to performance equity; on the other hand, the question of how (recognized) performance is created and defined is hardly answered satisfactorily. Thus, a close connection between social origin, educational success and social status in adulthood can still be observed - and in Germany in a particularly pronounced way. At the same time, the mechanisms of social inequality have changed."

As we observe how others observe us, we calibrate our self-presentation accordingly. Profile-based identity is evident everywhere from pop culture to politics,\nmarketing to morality. But all too often critics simply denounce\nthis alleged superficiality in defense of some supposedly pure\nideal of authentic or sincere expression. This book argues that the profile marks an epochal shift in our concept of identity and\ndemonstrates why that matters.  You and Your Profile  blends social theory, philosophy, and cultural critique to unfold an\nexploration of the way we have come to experience the world.\nInstead of polemicizing against the profile, Hans-Georg Moeller and Paul J. D’Ambrosio outline how it works, how we readily apply it in our daily lives, and how it shapes our values-personally,\neconomically, and ethically. They develop a practical vocabulary of life in the digital age. Informed by the Daoist tradition, they\nsuggest strategies for handling the pressure of social media by\ndistancing oneself from one’s public face. A deft and wide-ranging consideration of our era’s identity crisis, this book provides\nvital clues on how to stay sane in a time of proliferating\nprofiles.\n"
