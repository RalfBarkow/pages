The first thing that Koslow notes is that for laws and explanations to reduce possibilities, a new concept of possibilities and their reduction is needed. Koslow starts by describing a new set of possibilities (he calls them natural possibilities), which includes things as varied as the truth values of sentences, the members of sample spaces and the outcomes of tossing a die. Natural possibilities can be abstract (numbers, numerical equations, truth values), concrete (a particular act, such as eating a banana), object-like, property-like, structured, structureless, and so on. However varied these and other possibilities are, Koslow shows why they are all genuinely modal. He does this by introducing a mini-theory of natural possibilities. The modal character of a set of natural possibilities N is explained by means of the notion of a certain implication relation defined on the power set of N."

After showing how laws reduce possibilities, Koslow notes that Mellor’s facticity condition on explanation, namely that A’s explaining B entails both A and B, entails that explanations that either are laws or involve laws as parts will reduce possibilities. But not all explanations are like that: some do not involve laws at all. Koslow notes that many models of explanation do not guarantee that explanations reduce possibilities but says that Mellor accepts certain constraints on explanations which yield the result that explanations in general reduce possibilities. The constraint in question is that A’s explaining B entails that the chance of B given A is greater than the chance of B given the absence of A."
