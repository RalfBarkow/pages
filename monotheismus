Moses had the task to free the people, to which he belonged, from the dependence on the old Egypt and its Pharaohs, and from this it explains itself quite casually, thus without having to explain here in more detail, how he imagined this liberation: The unity of the people of the Jews is not guaranteed by a bodily present God, like the Pharaoh, but by a God who, at the beginning at least, is still personified, but completely banished into a beyond of the real world.

But the reason for this abstract unity, like the reality, which stood opposite to this unity, was completely different. With the Jews this unity was negatively related to the units they wanted to escape, it was determined directly from a historically given situation: just the ancient Egypt, but also, for example, the other empires competing with the Egyptians: Babylonians, Syrians, etc. Via this way of negation only the synthesis of the own context as a people results.

In any case, the Jews had to come up with a very good reason, considered against the background of the historical conditions prevailing in their environment, why they could nevertheless be absolutely devoted to this one God who could not even give them his commands himself. In short: a form had to be found in which this God communicated with them. In their God the unity, the truth, which overcomes all separations, is represented in an ideal way, but what follows from this, what is to be done and to be omitted, so that the unity also realizes itself in the world, that had to be determined in a new way, completely differently at any rate than the virtue doctrine of the Greeks tried to do, or than the way in which the laws issued by the Pharaohs claimed divine, i.e. general validity for themselves.

I have shown it above: the truth must include opposites in itself, otherwise it is none. Instead of including all opposites in God, as Aristotle did, in order to then be able to exclude them from thinking, which makes God an incomprehensible being, truth can, however, be understood precisely as the expression of a separation of God from man in principle, and thinking now has the task of processing this separation in its life: In the form of the laws enacted by God, and not, as with the ancient Greeks, and later still with the ancient Romans, a doctrine of virtue, the knowledge of which presupposes a sophisticated philosophical reflection (as shown: on money).

All common explanations of this history are philosophically insufficient, which means: they are fundamentally wrong. For they start from a concept of truth which owes its existence only to the logic of capital: Nowadays it is no longer asked what truth is, but true is unquestionably only that which allows to cast reality, as it is empirically given, into the form of general laws which have to be formulated free of contradictions in themselves. I do not elaborate on this, but state: Whoever examines the history of monotheism with this modern concept of truth, must include in this history either anthropological constants (such as a basic human need for religion, or spirituality, as it is mostly called today) or general laws (evolutionary mostly, such as that all changes in biological nature follow a principle immanent to this nature: be it the survival, be it the reduction of complexity, be it even the constant higher development of the species or genera or however formulated). But since already the empirical starting position never actually corresponds to these constants and laws, the problem arises, which is characteristic for the modern science, to have to interpret the interlocking of data situation and general laws constantly anew, although one should know that this process is infinite in principle."

      "text": "This separation, every high school student here in the West learns, describes what happened to man in the so-called Copernican turn: If he had previously been separated from God, but privileged by this God over all nature surrounding him, he now found himself confronted with a nature to which he had the faculty of knowledge ahead of him, but which he could otherwise conceive of himself only as one of its fleeting moments, only as something like a whim of this nature. The separation of God and man was replaced in the course of the Copernican turn by that of subject and object, but this more and more in the way already indicated here, that truth was not emphatically conceived as the synthetic moment of this separation (as for instance in Kant as transcendental subject), not, as in the Socratic method, in such a way to conceive ideas as the moment that synthesizes being and becoming, but just in the way the separation of God and man was already conceived theologically: just as here one side of the separated, God, was at the same time conceived as the mediating third, so now, in capitalist society, precisely one side of the subject/object opposition, that of the object, more precisely: nature, in which man is undoubtedly embedded, is elevated to the rank of the synthesizing third. If today we speak of objectivity instead of truth, as the sciences do, then we have long since accepted, deep down, that the separation of subject and object does not refer to a synthesizing third, analogous to that of being and becoming in Greek philosophy, but rather to the fact that what we tend to call the subject is nothing more than a moment of the object, to which, in order to become fully an object, only a certain unruliness remains, which will already give itself (and has already given itself once in National Socialism): then, for example, when all the movements of this subject can be proved as behavior determined by genes. Who speaks of objectivity instead of truth, thus basically talks just like Heidegger, when he murmurs about the being, which moves in time, and in it shows the knowing - the, as he calls it: Daseienden - that it *is*."

        "text": "This separation, every high school student here in the West learns, describes what happened to man in the so-called Copernican turn: If he had previously been separated from God, but privileged by this God over all nature surrounding him, he now found himself confronted with a nature to which he had the faculty of knowledge ahead of him, but which he could otherwise conceive of himself only as one of its fleeting moments, only as something like a whim of this nature. The separation of God and man was replaced in the course of the Copernican turn by that of subject and object, but this more and more in the way already indicated here, that truth was not emphatically conceived as the synthetic moment of this separation (as for instance in Kant as transcendental subject), not, as in the Socratic method, in such a way to conceive ideas as the moment that synthesizes being and becoming, but just in the way the separation of God and man was already conceived theologically: just as here one side of the separated, God, was at the same time conceived as the mediating third, so now, in capitalist society, precisely one side of the subject/object opposition, that of the object, more precisely: nature, in which man is undoubtedly embedded, is elevated to the rank of the synthesizing third. If today we speak of objectivity instead of truth, as the sciences do, then we have long since accepted, deep down, that the separation of subject and object does not refer to a synthesizing third, analogous to that of being and becoming in Greek philosophy, but rather to the fact that what we tend to call the subject is nothing more than a moment of the object, to which, in order to become fully an object, only a certain unruliness remains, which will already give itself (and has already given itself once in National Socialism): then, for example, when all the movements of this subject can be proved as behavior determined by genes. Who speaks of objectivity instead of truth, thus basically talks just like Heidegger, when he murmurs about the being, which moves in time, and in it shows the knowing - the, as he calls it: Daseienden - that it *is*.
