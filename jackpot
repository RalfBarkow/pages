One of the main fun parts is playing through whether and, if so, how the end of the world (\"[[Jackpot]]\" as it is called) will occur in these simultaneously artificial and real worlds, or editing the worlds in question so that it takes a course that suits the player in question. Burton and Flynne stumble upon the fact that they are characters in a very same game played, for example, by people like Lev Zubov (JJ Feild), the equally charming and murderous klept with whom the two have to deal."
