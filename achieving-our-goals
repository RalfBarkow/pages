First, the perception part of the interface experiences its environment, and the raw information is passed over to the eyes, which according to the intentions of the player separate the raw perceptions into distinctions by looking for interesting differences in value. The resulting pattern of distinguished objects is passed to the [[strategy]], which selects a number of objectives to meet as it sees fit. These objectives are passed to the hands, which in turn let themselves be controlled by the objectives by means of double dispatching. The actions fired by the objectives through the hands are queued at the action part of the interface, which at some point will hopefully cause a change in the environment. The action part of the interface perceives its surroundings again, and the cycle begins anew."

Second, when objectives control the hands it may be useful to synch up with the environment before having the hands perform the intended action. Thus, objectives may peek through the eyes in realtime waiting for the appropriate trigger before moving the hands as intended."
