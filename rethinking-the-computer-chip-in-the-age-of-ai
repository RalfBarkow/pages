Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, ANYbotics, Clearpath Robotics, Open Robotics, and Unitree pledged against weaponizing their &quot;advanced-mobility general-purpose robots&quot; or their underlying software, while also vowing to ensure their customers do not weaponize them either. The companies also said they do not oppose &quot;existing technologies&quot; used by governments to &quot;defend themselves and uphold their laws.&quot; Boston Dynamics says police and fire departments are using the company's canine-like robot Spot to assess hazardous situations, but the firm notes Spot is not designed for surveillance or as a substitute for police officers."
