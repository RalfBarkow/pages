Designing things and the creative process still delights me (and can be undertaken hidden from too much interaction with, and potential judgement of, others). However, afterschool I fell into a business program at university and before finishing that qualification I had a job in finance. I do recall the white shirt and tie, 'yes' culture of the finance industry at that time didn't fulfill. It certainly crushed the joy I felt being creative. I now wonder if, as that naïve 21year old, what was missing was any clarity I had about my 'why'.  "

At the time I started working in the education system men were often offered promotional opportunities very early in their career. This was usually as a principal in a one or two teacher school in a rural community. I was offered such a position just over eighteen months after graduating. It is true that the subsequent drive for advances in my career as a school leader were motivational. Another wonder is whether these promotions were about proving myself, and not because of any clarity of purpose."

I undertook an MBA in ‘entrepreneurship and small business management’. In my mind the idea was to go onto bigger and more important endeavours than running a small school.  On reflection I feel the original finance job, or being a small cog in a large bureaucratic education system, were not going to be rewarding or sufficient. The search for fulfillment even saw me resign from the department at one stage and start a photography business!"
