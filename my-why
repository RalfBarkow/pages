      "text": "When I was at high school I wanted to be an architect. I took great joy from a few of the subjects taken at high school - art and graphics. Designing things and the creative process still delights me. However, in another example of lacking self-confidence, after school I fell into a business program at university and before finishing that qualification I had a job in finance. The white shirt and tie, 'yes' culture of the finance industry at that time didn't fulfil. It certainly lacked the joy I felt when being creative. I now wonder if, as that naïve 21year old, what was missing was any clarity I had about my 'why'.  "

      "text": "Within a few years, I returned to university to become a teacher. At the time I started working in the education system men were often offered promotional opportunities very early in their career – this opportunity was usually as a principal in a one or two teacher school in a rural community. I was offered such a position just over eighteen months after graduating and my career in school leadership was underway. It’s true that the subsequent drive for advances in my career were a motivation. As I said previously, I do wonder whether these promotions were about further proving myself, and not because of any clarity of purpose."

      "text": "I continued to straddle the fields of education and business. Perhaps this positioning is part of being a constructive discontent – not being satisfied with where I was; with the status quo, always looking beyond where I was. I undertook a masters in ‘entrepreneurship and small business management’. In my mind, the idea was to go onto bigger and more important endeavours than running a small school. On reflection, I feel the original finance job, or being a small cog in a large bureaucratic education system, were not going to be rewarding, or sufficient for me. The search for fulfilment even saw me resign from the department at one stage and start a photography business!"

We'd been out to dinner with friends and on our way home my wife was reflecting on the times, I had become animated in conversations through the night. She said to me, “You know David, the only time I hear you talking about anything passionately is when you talk about education.” It was a powerful observation that when I felt most passionate was when I was standing on my soapbox and talking about how schooling could be improved – what felt like a [[Deep Truth]] flowing from within me. The saying goes that whilst no one conversation is guaranteed to change the trajectory of a life, any conversation can. This was one conversation that did."

Designing things and the creative process still delights me. However, in another example of lacking self-confidence, after school I fell into a business program at university and before finishing that qualification I had a job in finance. The white shirt and tie, 'yes' culture of the finance industry at that time didn't fulfil. It certainly lacked the joy I felt when being creative. I now wonder if, as that naïve 21year old, what was missing was any clarity I had about my 'why'.  "
