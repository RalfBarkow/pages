In this case, it may be best to make the method a public method of a different (possibly a new) class.  For example, if a class is doing some string manipulation and finds itself with a private method called changeTabsToSpaces, that is an excellent candidate to be made a public static method of some other class, where it can then be properly tested <i>and</i> easily used from other classes.  You may also find that there are several methods which operate upon a common subset of the class's state -- these may be a good candidate to become a new object.  Although you might think that these refactorings are silly, being done just so that you can test these methods, they are not -- they are design improvements that needed to happen anyhow, and your desire to reach into the private methods to test them was simply a warning sign that the design was probably not factored as well as it could be.",

In this case, it may be best to make the method a public method of a different (possibly a new) class.

You may also find that there are several methods which operate upon a common subset of the class's state -- these may be a good candidate to become a new object.

Use these macros consistently as replacements for the protected and private keywords in class declarations for classes with members or methods that I would like to keep accessible during testing. Also use the NDEBUG macro to conditionally compile any tests that require access to protected or private members in the unit tests. ",

This is a potential problem with any approach that uses access to private members, whether you gain access by conditional compilation by testing a subclass. It is not clear to me, howover, what sort of errors can be missed as a result of testing code that allows more promiscuous access to internals than that allowed in the production code. Can anyone give me a realistic example of a type of bug that you might miss as a result of this procedure if: i) Your classes pass all unit tests with some private members or methods converted to private, ii) The \"production\" code compiles correctly, despite the additional restrictions on access.  -David Morse",
