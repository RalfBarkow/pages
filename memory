Beyond the superficial return to archaisms and traditions, interest in memory is also growing through a more complex approach. After a few centuries of pursuing the future, it now seems to be caught up: the future has already begun, but we do not yet know what to do with it. The new is predominantly unknown, uncontrollable and largely incomprehensible – such as the Internet, developments in technology or the indeterminable perspectives of scientific research. For this reason, it seems useful to turn once again to memory. Not so much to revive a past that is definitively closed and useless for a future that we only know will be different, but rather because memory holds a [[Store of Forms]] that can be used to manage and structure the present. In other words, orientation to the future – taken to an extreme – leads once again to a confrontation with the present, and the structures of the present are provided by memory.\n"

      "text": "All this needs to be treated in more detail, and we will deal with it below. At this point we confine ourselves to mentioning that in the archaic and ancient form memory was much more than a mere preservation of memories. It represented the entity that gave order to the cosmos and thus gave meaning to action; it regulated the relationship between contingency and necessity, between the mutable and the eternal, between limited and disordered human affairs and the ultimate things of the world. In this respect, temporal references were of secondary importance: memory was recollection, but also anticipation, revival of the past, but also forgetting and prefiguring the future – it was above all the confirmation and establishment of a general order starting from a given point in time and context. It is this aspect of memory in particular that we need to revive: the idea that one has an orientation when one is oriented only to oneself – as is the case with one who remembers, and that this orientation, though contingent, is therefore not already accidental. We will deal with this by first outlining the procedures of divination (chap. II) and the techniques of rhetoric (chap. III), and then turn to the preconditions for the bruising debates that accompanied the exclusion of memory at the beginning of modernity (chap. IV), and in the wake of which memory as a subject of research has been all but forgotten.\n"

      "text": "This project, if taken seriously, presents some difficulties. First, the associated reference system must be determined: It is about memory, but whose memory is meant? It is well known that the idea of an individual subject is recent, at least it is closely linked to the emergence of modernity – but modernity is the age that has least to do with memory. If we are to study the pre-modern (or at least the forms of memory independent of the mainstream of modern semantics), we must refrain from the now suspect reference to the subject, although the subject continues to be the more or less implicit reference point of almost all studies of memory. Even Halbwachs's concept of collective memory and considerations of so-called computer memory do not dispense with the primary reference to forms of subjectivity, which, as we shall see, are of little use to us. Our main interest will rather be on extra-individual forms of memory – our reference system will therefore be the memory of society. Here, we understand society to be an autonomous system that proceeds with its own operations, radically distinct from the mental operations of the individuals participating in it – which ties in with [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s definition of society. Memory, with which we want to deal, is thus neither a subject of psychology nor of biology, but it is and can only be a subject of sociology.\n"

      "text": "But by what is the memory of society determined, if not by psychological and biological structures? In Luhmann's conception, society consists of communications. If memory concerns the way in which self-reference is established, then the way in which communications refer to communications depends primarily on the tools or the available means to manage this, and that means concretely: on the technologies (or media) of communication. If it becomes possible to record communication in writing and thus to return to it at a later point in time, or if, for example, the possibility arises through the press to address persons who are distant in time or place and even completely unknown, then the way in which communication connects to itself and conditions itself also changes. In other words, the form of society's memory changes.\n"

But one could also say, and perhaps it is the same thing, that the memory of society is the precondition for the enforcement and diffusion of certain means of communication. In essence, the thesis states that there is a circular relationship of mutual influence between memory and communication media, and that this relationship can be discerned by analyzing the time reference, the degree of conceptual abstraction, the nature of environmental engagement, and, above all, the self-reflexivity of communication.\n"

      "text": "This basic assumption is becoming increasingly relevant as we live in an information society in which communication technologies are literally machine-driven, posing entirely new kinds of interpretive problems. The Internet is about to become the neuralgic center of projections of the future that we cannot possibly control. Thus, at the same time, it is beginning to become the neuralgic center of the organization of memory, which in turn is regaining relevance. In our view, therefore, it is no coincidence that both topics are becoming the focus of interest at the same time, just as it is no coincidence that the theories available provide extremely unsatisfactory explanations in both respects. If one wants to examine the memory of contemporary society, then one must also take into account the incursion of telematics, its preconditions and the reactions to it (such as the fear of \"big brother\" or the syndrome of waiting for the revolution), the impossibility of controlling the \"net\" and the new forms of network connections that emerge almost by themselves out of precisely this impossibility of control. All this will occupy us in chapter V, where we will try to outline the related memory model with its peculiarity of using the context (meaning the so-called user/machine interactivity) to limit possible arbitrariness.\n"

      "text": "The choice of the topic >memory< is additionally made for reasons immanent to the theory: it is an object that can be used to show in which way reflexivity operates. Reflexivity has become ubiquitous. The problems of self-reference, observer dependence, the receding of linear relations before circular configurations are the presuppositions of any theoretical work with a modicum of scientific pretensions – it is these problems that inevitably tend to generate paradoxes. This is true of sociology in general, and to a special degree of memory. Everything that can be said about it can also be formulated as a paradox: Memory is simultaneously past and present, subjective and objective, personal and uncontrollable, memory and forgetting – and in each case one side of the distinction forms the condition for the existence of the opposite one. What is interesting, however, is not the mere exposure of paradoxes, but the demonstration that structures emerge nonetheless (or precisely because of them). In the case of memory, this involves examining how memory works – how it remembers, forgets, and forms its own structures. By explaining the mechanisms of memory, one indirectly finds an explanation for reflexivity and its conditions – as long as one does not stop at the explanation of paradoxes, but tries to reach more complex forms of stability by means of a theoretical construction.\n"

        "text": "Today, however, it looks as if a different attitude is gaining ground. Beyond the superficial return to archaisms and traditions, interest in memory is also growing through a more complex approach. After a few centuries of pursuing the future, it now seems to be caught up: the future has already begun, but we do not yet know what to do with it. The new is predominantly unknown, uncontrollable and largely incomprehensible – such as the Internet, developments in technology or the indeterminable perspectives of scientific research. For this reason, it seems useful to turn once again to memory. Not so much to revive a past that is definitively closed and useless for a future that we only know will be different, but rather because memory holds a store of forms that can be used to manage and structure the present. In other words, orientation to the future – taken to an extreme – leads once again to a confrontation with the present, and the structures of the present are provided by memory.\n"

An dieser Stelle beschränken wir uns darauf, zu erwähnen, dass in der archaischen und antiken Form das Gedächtnis viel mehr war als ein bloßes Bewahren von Erinnerungen. Es stellte diejenige Instanz dar, die dem Kosmos eine Ordnung gab und damit dem Handeln einen Sinn verlieh; es regelte das Verhältnis zwischen Kontingenz und Notwendigkeit, zwischen dem Veränderbaren und dem Ewigen, zwischen den begrenzten und ungeordneten menschlichen Angelegenheiten und den letzten Dingen der Welt. In dieser Hinsicht waren temporale Bezüge von untergeordneter Bedeutung: Das Gedächtnis war Erinnerung, aber auch Vorwegnahme, Wiederbelebung der Vergangenheit, aber auch Vergessen und vorausdeutende Darstellung der Zukunft - es war vor allem die Bestätigung und Herstellung einer allgemeinen Ordnung, die von einem gegebenen Zeitpunkt und Zusammenhang ausging. Insbesondere diesen Aspekt von Gedächtnis gilt es wiederzubeleben: die Idee, dass man über eine Orientierung verfügt, wenn man sich nur an sich selbst orientiert - so wie es dem ergeht, der sich erinnert und dass diese Orientierung, wenn auch kontingent, darum nicht schon zufällig ist. Dies werden wir behandeln, indem wir zuerst die Prozeduren der Wahrsagung (Kap. II) und die Techniken der Rhetorik (Kap. III) darstellen, um dann auf die Voraussetzungen für die zermürbenden Debatten zu sprechen zu kommen, die die Ausgrenzung des Gedächtnisses zu Beginn der Moderne begleitet haben (Kap. IV) und in deren Anschluss das Gedächtnis als Forschungsgegenstand so gut wie vergessen worden ist.\n"

If it becomes possible to record communication in writing and thus to return to it at a later point in time, or if, for example, the possibility arises through the press to address persons who are distant in time or place and even completely unknown, then the way in which communication connects to itself and conditions itself also changes.

But one could also say, and perhaps it is the same thing, that the memory of society is the precondition for the enforcement and diffusion of certain means of communication. In essence, the thesis states that there is a circular relationship of mutual influence between memory and communication media, and that this relationship can be discerned by analyzing the time reference, the degree of conceptual abstraction, the nature of environmental engagement, and, above all, the self-reflexivity of communication.\n"

The Internet is about to become the neuralgic center of projections of the future that we cannot possibly control. Thus, at the same time, it is beginning to become the neuralgic center of the organization of memory, which in turn is regaining relevance. In our view, therefore, it is no coincidence that both topics are becoming the focus of interest at the same time, just as it is no coincidence that the theories available provide extremely unsatisfactory explanations in both respects. If one wants to examine the memory of contemporary society, then one must also take into account the incursion of telematics, its preconditions and the reactions to it (such as the fear of \"big brother\" or the syndrome of waiting for the revolution), the impossibility of controlling the \"net\" and the new forms of network connections that emerge almost by themselves out of precisely this impossibility of control. All this will occupy us in chapter V, where we will try to outline the related memory model with its peculiarity of using the context (meaning the so-called user/machine interactivity) to limit possible arbitrariness.\n"

Reflexivity has become ubiquitous. The problems of self-reference, observer dependence, the receding of linear relations before circular configurations are the presuppositions of any theoretical work with a modicum of scientific pretensions - it is these problems that inevitably tend to generate paradoxes. This is true of sociology in general, and to a special degree of memory. Everything that can be said about it can also be formulated as a paradox: Memory is simultaneously past and present, subjective and objective, personal and uncontrollable, memory and forgetting - and in each case one side of the distinction forms the condition for the existence of the opposite one. What is interesting, however, is not the mere exposure of paradoxes, but the demonstration that structures emerge nonetheless (or precisely because of them). In the case of memory, this involves examining how memory works - how it remembers, forgets, and forms its own structures. By explaining the mechanisms of memory, one indirectly finds an explanation for reflexivity and its conditions - as long as one does not stop at the explanation of paradoxes, but tries to reach more complex forms of stability by means of a theoretical construction.\n"
