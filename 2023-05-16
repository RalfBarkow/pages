A majority of the grammarian's efforts are devoted to the disambiguation process, first hypothesizing rules which dictate constituent categories and relationships among words in ambiguous sentences, and then seeking exceptions and corrections to these rules.\nIn this work, I propose an automatic method for acquiring a statistical parser from a set of parsed sentences which takes advantage of some initial linguistic input, but avoids the pitfalls of the iterative and seemingly endless grammar development process. Based on distributionally-derived and linguistically-based features of language, this parser acquires a set of statistical decision trees which assign a probability distribution on the space of parse trees given the input sentence. These decision trees take advantage of significant amount of contextual information, potentially including all of the lexical information in the sentence, to produce highly accurate statistical models of the disambiguation process. By basing the disambiguation criteria selection on entropy reduction rather than human intuition, this parser development method is able to consider more sentences than a human grammarian can when making individual disambiguation rules.\nIn experiments between a parser, acquired using this statistical framework, and a grammarian's rule-based parser, developed over a ten-year period, both using the same training material and test sentences, the decision tree parser significantly outperformed the grammar-based parser on the accuracy measure which the grammarian was trying to maximize, achieving an accuracy of 78% compared to the grammar-based parser's 69%."

In the late 1980s, we developed Smalltalk on a DEC VAX/8600 computer to promote education and research of object-oriented programming in China. Smalltalk can also be used as the language of object-oriented database e.g., Gemstone. However, an object-oriented data model makes it hard to define views and handle role multiplicity as well as [[Object Migration]]. We extended the object-oriented data model with the new concepts of deputy objects and deputy classes. The new model is called the object deputy model and can provide a unified realization of object views, roles and migration. It can be implemented in Smalltalk. In China, there are other Smalltalk-related research projects such as the Smalltalk program understanding support system and Chinese character information processing in Smalltalk. We introduce these research works."

Based on distributionally-derived and linguistically-based features of language, this parser acquires a set of statistical decision trees which assign a probability distribution on the space of parse trees given the input sentence. These decision trees take advantage of significant amount of contextual information, potentially including all of the lexical information in the sentence, to produce highly accurate statistical models of the disambiguation process. By basing the disambiguation criteria selection on entropy reduction rather than human intuition, this parser development method is able to consider more sentences than a human grammarian can when making individual disambiguation rules.\nIn experiments between a parser, acquired using this statistical framework, and a grammarian's rule-based parser, developed over a ten-year period, both using the same training material and test sentences, the decision tree parser significantly outperformed the grammar-based parser on the accuracy measure which the grammarian was trying to maximize, achieving an accuracy of 78% compared to the grammar-based parser's 69%."

They can be used to capture mutations made to objects, including their data and behavior, and apply those changes to another Smalltalk environment.\n\nHere's a general approach to recording mutation vectors for object migration in Smalltalk using change sets:\n\nCreate a new change set: In your Smalltalk development environment, create a new change set dedicated to tracking the mutations for the object migration. Change sets are typically represented as collections of code changes.\nIdentify the objects to be migrated: Determine which objects you want to migrate from one Smalltalk environment to another. These objects should be self-contained, with all the necessary data and behavior encapsulated within them.\nTrack mutations in the change set: As you make changes to the objects, such as modifying instance variables or adding/removing methods, ensure that these changes are recorded in the dedicated change set. This can be done by adding the code snippets representing these changes to the change set.\nCapture object state: To record the complete state of an object, including its instance variables, you can define methods on the object that return its state as a dictionary or any suitable data structure. You can then invoke these methods and store the resulting state in the change set.\nSerialize the change set: Once you have recorded all the mutations related to the object migration, you can serialize the change set. This step involves converting the change set into a format that can be easily transferred to another Smalltalk environment. Smalltalk provides built-in mechanisms for serialization, such as saving the change set as a file.\nMigrate the change set: Transfer the serialized change set to the target Smalltalk environment where you want to apply the recorded mutations.\nApply the change set: Load the change set into the target Smalltalk environment and apply the recorded mutations to the appropriate objects. The specific steps for applying the change set may vary depending on the Smalltalk implementation you're using.\nBy following these steps, you can record mutation vectors for object migration in Smalltalk using change sets. Change sets provide a convenient way to track and manage changes, making it easier to migrate objects between Smalltalk environments while preserving their state and behavior."
