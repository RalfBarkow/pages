I thought I was in luck as the Chair was Prof of Math and Systems @ Cambridge university.\nAt first he didn't respond but I persisted.

My dad was patiently waiting outside in the car he had driven me over in....\nThis stopped them playing games and they got interested. They offered me a \"deal\". I would give their board a weekend workshop to use it on their own strategy. In return they would give me access to their teachers and let me run a PD course for teachers.\nThe workshop went well but the owner refused to keep his side of the bargain. Why? He told me that it had been hard work....too hard for teachers on a jolly from work. That he had competitors who offered an equally good day off work - nice food, surroundings, a it of learning but not too much. I was too much. ST is too much!"

I did a number of experiments at **Chapeltown Academy**, Sheffield, where my niece had been in the 6th form. \n(a) I offered a course in *Business Thinking* and made it easy to participate (free, in school hours etc). At the first session 10 students turned up. At the second, there were only 3. I asked the 7 why they had given up and they told me that it was difficult and they weren't going to get a qualification that would help them to get into university! By the third session I had only one boy who stuck with it through thick and thin (including getting laughed at by his peers in the common room when he was sitting talking to me!) I asked him why he had continued with me when all his pals had quit. He told me that he could see how he could use this everywhere and that he was quitting chemistry A level to give himself time to develop his skill. That one boy gave me the hope to carry on. \n(b) I also did sessions with the *geography* students. We explored climate change as a system and discovered the options humanity faces. When asked how they felt about the future scenarios that emerged from their model one boy said he had a different solution. He told us that we could all get on a space ship and escape to another planet. So I asked him what would happen to the new planet if nobody changed their mindset on the journey and he almost shouted that the same thing would happen to that planet. I asked what should we do then? And he said we have to change our mindset and our behavior. This is not dissimilar to [[Do It Naturally]].I wonder if that boy changed *his* mindset and behavior?"

She told me a story of 2 boys fighting on the playground. She asked them what had happened and why. One boy explained the history and the other agreed. She asked what would be the consequences if this continued and they explained that people would get hurt and others would be disturbed. She asked what should happen next and they said they should be punished! They suggested they wanted to be punished by missing their break the next day as they had spoiled this break for the others. Because they had been so fair she offered them the opportunity to play a game of their choice while they were locked inside! This gives me *Hope*!!"

He taught me that hen we (or should I say \"I\"?)  try to prevent failure we prevent learning. He taught me that learning through experiments with horses can be life changing. Willy would die for learning. He has devoted his life to a big experiment to explore how to create and maintain a horse on full power from conception to grave.

My dad was patiently waiting outside in the car he had driven me over in....\nThis stopped them playing games and they got interested. They offered me a \"deal\". I would give their board a weekend workshop to use it on their own strategy. In return they would give me access to their teachers and let me run a PD course for teachers.\nThe workshop went well but the owner refused to keep his side of the bargain. Why? He told me that it had been hard work....too hard for teachers on a jolly from work. That he had competitors who offered an equally good day off work - nice food, surroundings, a it of learning but not too much. I was too much. ST is too much!"

Once again I turned out to be wrong. \nI thought that the best way in would be through my subject \"Maths\" and I contacted the committee that sets the Maths curriculum. I thought I was in luck as the Chair was Prof of Math and Systems @ Cambridge university.\nAt first he didn't respond but I persisted. He agreed with me but said it was impossible as he couldn't find teachers to teach basic maths!"

At the first in-person meeting I had to threaten to leave as they were disrespecting my (and more importantly my dad's) time. My dad was patiently waiting outside in the car he had driven me over in....\nThis stopped them playing games and they got interested. They offered me a \"deal\". I would give their board a weekend workshop to use it on their own strategy. In return they would give me access to their teachers and let me run a PD course for teachers.\nThe workshop went well but the owner refused to keep his side of the bargain. Why? He told me that it had been hard work....too hard for teachers on a jolly from work. That he had competitors who offered an equally good day off work - nice food, surroundings, a it of learning but not too much. I was too much. ST is too much!"

He said that those who are naturally talented rarely know what it is they are doing. He said observe and ask questions but remember that they are not you. You will have to try it for yourself and find your own way. Trial and error. When we (or should I say \"I\"?)  try to prevent failure we prevent learning."

I would modify it and say *\"there is nothing so good for the wholeness of a human being as the wholeness of a horse\"*. See [[Riding Dynamics]]. I have learned so much from **[[Willy Sidorak]]**. He taught me that hen we (or should I say \"I\"?)  try to prevent failure we prevent learning. He taught me that learning through experiments with horses can be life changing. Willy would die for learning. He has devoted his life to a big experiment to explore how to create and maintain a horse on full power from conception to grave. How can we help Willy to create a *European Centre of Excellence for Ethical Horsemanship*?"

        "text": "8. I did a number of experiments at **Chapeltown Academy**, Sheffield, where my niece had been in the 6th form. \n(a) I offered a course in *Business Thinking* and made it easy to participate (free, in school hours etc). At the first session 10 students turned up. At the second, there were only 3. I asked the 7 why they had given up and they told me that it was difficult and they weren't going to get a qualification that would help them to get into university! By the third session I had only one boy who stuck with it through thick and thin (including getting laughed at by his peers in the common room when he was sitting talking to me!) I asked him why he had continued with me when all his pals had quit. He told me that he could see how he could use this everywhere and that he was quitting chemistry A level to give himself time to develop his skill. That one boy gave me the hope to carry on. \n(b) I also did sessions with the *geography* students. We explored climate change as a system and discovered the options humanity faces. When asked how they felt about the future scenarios that emerged from their model one boy said he had a different solution. He told us that we could all get on a space ship and escape to another planet. So I asked him what would happen to the new planet if nobody changed their mindset on the journey and he almost shouted that the same thing would happen to that planet. I asked what should we do then? And he said we have to change our mindset and our behavior. This is not dissimilar to [[Do It Naturally]].I wonder if that boy changed *his* mindset and behavior?"

I said what if they do nothing? He said they'll experience the consequences. He waits for them to ask him questions then he asks them how they would answer the question! His daughter is into horses and so that is what she does. I guess that is the same as we learnt from age 0 to school!"
