An opportunity to mark the roll and collect notes, yes, but more of an opportunity for pastoral care. Our tutor teacher chatted with us about our day, we had an opportunity to ask for support, sometimes we played games and we more generally built relationships. Connections were purposefully deepened. I loved tutor group. I loved my final school. "

I was six years old and I was fumbling for my eraser, nervous on my first day.  "
