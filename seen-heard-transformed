An opportunity to mark the roll and collect notes, yes, but more of an opportunity for pastoral care. Our tutor teacher chatted with us about our day, we had an opportunity to ask for support, sometimes we played games and we more generally built relationships. Connections were purposefully deepened. I loved tutor group. I loved my final school. "

I was six years old and I was fumbling for my eraser, nervous on my first day.  "

I recall distinctly the day that solidified this understanding. It was my first day at one of my new schools and I accidently knocked my full pencil case onto the ground. The teacher thought I had done it on purpose and swiftly put me in my place, telling me that I’d disrupted the whole class, barking that I couldn’t behave in this way at my new school and insisting that I needed to ‘hurry up and quietly complete my work and quit playing around’. I was six years old and I was fumbling for my eraser, nervous on my first day. What a beautiful welcome. "
