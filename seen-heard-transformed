The stability and connection I was craving was absent. Across my twelve years of education, I attended five schools. I wonder often what my teachers back then thought of me, the box they put me into."

I recall distinctly the day that solidified this understanding. It was my first day at one of my new schools and I accidently knocked my full pencil case onto the ground. The teacher thought I had done it on purpose and swiftly put me in my place, telling me that I’d disrupted the whole class, barking that I couldn’t behave in this way at my new school and insisting that I needed to ‘hurry up and quietly complete my work and quit playing around’. I was six years old and I was fumbling for my eraser, nervous on my first day. What a beautiful welcome. "

The striking differences altered my entire perception of school. Each morning we met in tutor groups organised by grade and house teams. An opportunity to mark the roll and collect notes, yes, but more of an opportunity for pastoral care. Our tutor teacher chatted with us about our day, we had an opportunity to ask for support, sometimes we played games and we more generally built relationships. I loved tutor group. I loved my final school. "

My house leader, a senior teacher, suggested I nominate for House Captain. This challenged my inner narrative - possibly the most uncoordinated amongst my year level.
