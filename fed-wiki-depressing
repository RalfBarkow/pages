Why isn't this on Ward's start page?\n- hä? Description is confusing, 4 steps, drag them to done is useless UI shit if I don't understand what to do first of all\n- gave up after not being able to do step 1. Really, Ward, that's the next step in wikis!?\n- Claim the site, hä? I only want to make a page\n- I click the lock icon. It says Welcome back wardcunningham. I'm not Ward. Hä?\n- the UI jumped to Ward's start page, I lost my page, my context. At least the back button works now\n- with some URL pruning I'm at https://wiki.ralfbarkow.ch/view/welcome-visitors\n- here is a Create New Page form, interesting, I'll try that but I actually didn't want to mess up somebody else's wiki\n- I have a new page, it has a yellow border (what, why?), I can't edit this page. I want to cry, holy shit, what a UX, I'd better run away\n- I read previously that I should double click to edit. But the page is empty. There is nothing to double click.\n- I don't know if this is just a draft, or saved, and if saved then where, locally, on the server? Will it be lost if I navigate away? How would I find this new page ever again? Uaaaahhh. Makes me appreciate local markdown files. It might just be a research project, then everything is \"ok\" and blessed.\n- I'd like to ask Ward, how, after c2.com, he could make such bad thing\n- now I'll send my unedited notes to this Ralf and/or Ward, will try ward@c2.com\n- could not find Ralf's email. On http://ralfbarkow.ch/ I get a 403 forbidden. I guess that was my experience with Federated Wiki. Sad. Wasted time."
