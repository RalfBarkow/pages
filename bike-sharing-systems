Developing an inventory model for a BSS involves unique challenges because of the special features of these systems. A BSS experiences two types of demand: a demand for bicycles, by customers who wish to enter the system (renters), and a demand for lockers, by users who have finished their rides and wish to leave the system (returners). Therefore, basic inventory logic that dictates that a higher inventory level can satisfy more customers is not suitable for addressing this problem. Because each station has a fixed capacity, a larger quantity of bicycles at a given station implies a smaller quantity of available lockers. Because of the nonhomogeneous asymmetric demand processes that typically characterize BSSs, an inherent imbalance is created, leading to shortages both of bicycles when users are attempting to rent them and of vacant lockers when users are attempting to return them."

For instance, several authors have presented pricing mechanisms that give customers incentives to change their origins and/or destinations, for example, Chemla et al. (2013b), Pfrommer et al. (2014), and Waserhole and Jost (2016). Kaspi, Raviv, and Tzur (2014), and Kaspi et al. (2016) proposed a parking reservation policy in which a user reserves a locker at the intended destination station before renting a bicycle, thereby diminishing uncertainty and redirecting that user’s demand to an available station. A different kind of policy was presented by Fricker and Gast (2016). Their policy encourages users to choose two destination stations instead of one, and the system then directs them to the station with more vacant lockers."

      "text": "Most static repositioning studies assume that a target inventory level or range of inventory levels is known for each station. Only a few studies have addressed the issue of how to determine these target levels for static repositioning. Nair and Miller-Hooks (2011) formulated the problem as a stochastic mixed integer program with the objective of minimizing the cost of the redistribution operation for a required service level. They defined a shortage as a net difference between the total demand over the planning horizon and the total inventory, ignoring the sequence of events occurring in the system. Raviv and Kolka (2013) and Schuijbroek, Hampshire, and van Hoeve (2017) presented a Markov chain–based model in which the inventory level is tracked continuously throughout the day. Renters who arrive at an empty station and returners who arrive at a full station are assumed to abandon the system and are considered to be lost sales. Raviv and Kolka (2013) suggested a user dissatisfaction function that measures the performance of a station in terms of the expected penalty due to abandonment by returners and renters as a function of the initial inventory at a single station. Schuijbroek, Hampshire, and van Hoeve (2017) used dual-bounded service level constraints presented by Nair and Miller-Hooks (2011). Another study that addressed the issue of target inventory levels was conducted by Leurent (2012), who modeled bike sharing stations as a dual Markovian waiting system and assumed that unsatisfied customers would wait at a station rather than abandoning the system. All of these studies considered models based on a single station, meaning that each station’s inventory target level was calculated independently of the others, and the interactions among stations were neglected. In Vogel, Neumann Saavedra, and Mattfeld (2014), the inventory levels of all stations were set simultaneously, but these authors also ignored the influence of interaction on the system because they treated shortages of bicycles and lockers as lost sales. They determined the stations’ inventory levels to minimize the total expected operation costs of the system due to relocation while satisfying a minimal level of service."

      "text": "The interactions among the inventory levels at different stations are an inherent attribute of a BSS. When a customer arrives at an empty station (or when she observes this status online), she can choose between searching for an available bicycle at a neighboring station (referred to as roaming) or abandoning the system to use other means of transportation. Thus, an empty station can create a spillover of demand to nearby stations. In addition, if the customer decides not to use the system, a future demand for a locker at the destination station is eliminated. Such interactions occur between stations that are a distance from one another. Moreover, when a customer wishes to return her bicycle, she may arrive at a full station and then be obliged to find an available space at another station nearby (also referred to as roaming), meaning that a full station will always create locker demand at neighboring stations. In accordance with this concept, Rudloff and Lackner (2013) presented different count demand models for BSSs and demonstrated that full/empty stations have an influence on neighboring stations’ demand. George and Xia (2011) addressed the problem of determining the optimal fleet size for a vehicle rental company and derived analytical results for its relationship to vehicle availability at each rental station in the network."

Our contributions are as follows: First, we present a formal definition and mathematical formulation of the BSS inventory problem with station interactions (BSIP-SI).

This search uses a simulation model in which a user behavior model is implemented. This model includes the roaming between stations (that is, seeking an alternative station) that occurs upon a shortage of bicycles or lockers. Third, we use real data to test our algorithm and compare our results with the common practice of operators and with the results of the model presented in Raviv and Kolka (2013), which ignores these interactions. We show that our algorithm results in a better quality of service for all of the different instances tested.
