The research of Campbell, Brown and DiBello (1991) on the development of expertise in computer programmers relied heavily on structured interviews with experts and trainees.  The subjects were asked \"meta-level\" questions such as: How do you plan projects?  How do you recognize problems?  Can you compare how you do things now with how you did things when you were a beginner?  Can you tell from a program how expert the programmer was?  How did your knowledge of languages help when you learned a new one?  The researchers also conducted a longitudinal study, using audiotaped diaries of programmers who were learning Smalltalk, an object-oriented language.  The research showed the limitations of trying to distinguish experts from novices without considering intermediate stages of skill development.\n"

This sets the developmental approach of Campbell et al. apart from others (e.g. Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1986), which distinguish stages solely at a conceptual level, unanchored to empirical markers.

(1978) studied the way physicians made diagnoses and found that the physicians rarely used a purely inductive method of letting the data drive the inferences.  Even though the physicians were trained to reserve judgement rather than contaminate the process, they still could not resist forming early impressions.  Elstein et al. referred to this strategy as hypothetico-deductive method, because the early judgements were hypotheses that helped to direct the subsequent information gathering.  Without early hypothesis, the information gathering would have been inefficient and interminable.  Weitzenfeld, Klein, Riedl, Freeman, and Musa (1991) observed the same phenomenon in a study of expertise in software troubleshooting.  Experts were able to formulate initial hypotheses, or stories of how the problem might have arisen, and could use these hypotheses to direct the search for more evidence.  Where do hypotheses come from?  Presumably, they involve the same mechanism of situation assessment as was discussed earlier – using experience to judge typicality.\n"

      "text": "We feel it may be useful to examine a somewhat different perspective, one that centers around the way the experts perceive tasks and situations:\n\n1. There are several ways that experts can see things that others cannot: Experts can use their knowledge base to recognize typicality, experts can use perceptual learning to make fine discriminations, and experts can use mental simulation to represent antecedents and consequents.\n\n2. Experts can also use their knowledge base to apply higher level rules, such as top-down processing.  Such rules are also in the repertoire of novices and journeymen.  People at lower skill levels infrequently use higher level strategies because they lack the experience base to make such strategies work.\n\n3. Therefore, trying to train general strategies for thinking like experts may not be worthwhile.  Attempts to teach such strategies are not useful in developing expertise, and research does not demonstrate the effectiveness of such attempts.\n\n4. Training can address methods for sharpening perceptual skills and changing the way situations are experienced.  There are ways of providing personal experiences, manufactured experiences, and vicarious experiences to accelerate the growth of expertise.  We have shown how models of expertise can form the basis of knowledge engineering programs for training specialists in areas as diverse as nursing, computer programming, and research management.\n\n5. It may be useful to develop a discipline of knowledge engineering, to direct us in eliciting and applying expert knowledge."

Consider a study by Chi, Hutchinson, and Robin (1988), in which descriptions of novel dinosaurs were presented to children who were \"dinosaur expert\" or novices.  These novel dinosaurs were designed to be either typical or atypical.  The experts, of course, realized immediately that a dinosaur was typical of a call of dinosaurs and were then able to attribute all the relevant features from the family to which the novel \"typical\" dinosaur belonged.  The experts were equally proficient at determining that a novel dinosaur that was not typical did not belong to any of the familiar families.  Novices lacked this ability to judge typicality and to use it to infer other characteristics.\n\n"

Even though the physicians were trained to reserve judgement rather than contaminate the process, they still could not resist forming early impressions.  Elstein et al. referred to this strategy as hypothetico-deductive method, because the early judgements were hypotheses that helped to direct the subsequent information gathering.  Without early hypothesis, the information gathering would have been inefficient and interminable.  Weitzenfeld, Klein, Riedl, Freeman, and Musa (1991) observed the same phenomenon in a study of expertise in software troubleshooting.  Experts were able to formulate initial hypotheses, or stories of how the problem might have arisen, and could use these hypotheses to direct the search for more evidence.  Where do hypotheses come from?  Presumably, they involve the same mechanism of situation assessment as was discussed earlier – using experience to judge typicality."
