I'm interested in seeing if this will stay true for the other more concrete/small scale patterns as well and if they will only be really meaningful in relation to each other.\n\ngilesdring — Yesterday at 11:23 AM\nI think, as has been observed in our discussions previously, that the book is A Pattern Language that encapsulates the collective world view of the authors. We’ve seen the Utopianism that this manifests in the large scale patterns. We’re now seeing the “rightness of a solution given this context” in the more actionable patterns. It’ll be interesting to follow this narrative in the way you suggest… In their defence, right up top of the book they say that it’s up to the reader to construct their own pattern language that works for their context.\n\njonasmerlin — Today at 1:57 AM\nAbsolutely agree. Part of me still thinks that it would have been very interesting to decide on a \"project\" before starting our journey and then structuring our reading around that, like they suggest in the book's intro. Exactly because of the book's insistance that the patterns only become \"whole\" in specific contexts.\n\nhanbzu — Today at 4:18 AM\nThat's a good way of putting it, hierarchy is inevitable. Hierarchies emerge in all natural structures, so they are, at least, useful. But things are more complicated, as Alexander himself wrote in his 1965 essay \"A city is not a tree\", acknowledging that relationships never conform to a pure hierarchical structure—and accusing high modernist urban planners of making that mistake. Also it's important the process that generates hierarchies, they could be designed from the top, or emerge from the bottom, a combination of the two and everything in between "
