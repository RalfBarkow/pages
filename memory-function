Here, however, the tunnel graph shows the time jump: to the equation E1: [...] belongs the shape of two circles lying inside each other. Inside the inner circle lies a, inside the outer circle lies b. Since f is on the one hand the total expression (on the left side of the equation) and on the other hand the innermost partial expression (on the right side of the equation, inside the circle next to a), the circular area of the inner circle is connected with the exterior of both circles (...). Here the impulses start from the occupancies of the two variables a and b, the value, which the inner circle assumes in dependence on a, is transmitted (via the tunnel) to the circle exterior and thus determines the total expression. For the case that both variables a and b take the value n (unmarked), the memory function is to begin. The memory shall be stored, which of the two variables a or b has taken the value marked last. If this is true for a, then the whole expression f is marked, if this is true for b, then the expression is unmarked. The effective transmission shall be limited to the direction from outside to inside."
