What can computer simulations of language evolution tell us, and what may we learn from primate studies?

In the latter connection I am indebted to Edward Moseid and Kristiansand Zoo and Wildlife Park (in the Southern Part of Norway) for opening their doors for my observations of chimpanzee and offspring interaction. My observations began in 1992 when one of the chimpanzee mothers there saved her previously near-rejected infant from suffocation and after that became a holding mother in Winnicott’s sense. This is recounted in Chapter 5, and as illustrated there, I have records not just of infants clinging to their mothers, but of offspring carrying their younger siblings, when allowed by the watching mother. It is striking how the infant, clinging to the mother’s back, not only moves with her movements, but usually also adjusts the head to the mother’s head direction, and thus appears to gaze in the same direction as the mother’s gaze. Deprived of this advantage of protective and nurturing carrying and clinging, I submit, those hominid infants and parents who had the compensating capacity to [[warn]] and listen to warning signals and to teach and learn to cope by altercentric participation in the other, would come to have a critical selective advantage. This presupposes an adapted mirror systems allowing for perceptual reversal in face-to-face situations (which subjects with autism find difficult, returned to in Chapter 11)."

Here is emphasized Stern’s ‘staircase-logic’, by which each lower layer continues to be operative and support higher-order layers. This is the same logic that we apply in distinguishing the steps from primary to higher order tertiary intersubjectivity in ontogeny (Bråten & Trevarthen 1994/2000, 2007). They permit a halting comparison with the cultural transitions in evolution as posited by Donald (1991), giving rise to questions about phylogeny pursued in Part II."

Some connectionist models described concern the kind of mirror neurons support and adaptation required for perception and imitation in face-to-face situation of such apparently simple acts as observing and re-enacting arm-raising or a hand sign, and which actually require a radical frame of reference shift entailing perceptual reversal."

And what is more, much of this would have to occur in face-to-face interaction."

      "text": "As will be turned to in detail in Chapter 8, before their first year’s birthday infants are able to reciprocate the spoon-feeding to which they have been subjected, and even reveal by their mouth-movements that they take a virtual part in the other’s intake of food. Such occurrences will be accounted for in terms of a ‘virtual other’ mechanism (Bråten 1986/1988) operating as an altercentric resonant mirror system enabling the infant to feel a virtual moving with alter’s feeding movements from alter’s stance, leaving the infant with a procedural memory of having been a virtual co-author of the feeding, guiding the subsequent reciprocating re-enactment. This is learning by altercentric participation, defined as imitational learning by Ego’s virtual participation in Alter’s act from Alter’s stance as if Ego had been facing the same direction or been hand-guided giving rise to shared temporal vitality (affects) contours, reflecting the manner in which the enactment is felt to be virtually co-enacted and the feeling that directs the co-enactment, enabling circular re-enactment from procedural memory of such virtual co-enactments. The term ‘vitality contours’ is [[Daniel N. Stern]]’s (1999) term for such jointly experienced feelings that specify the movement contour, in contrast to discrete emotions. Consistently, the procedural memory left by such virtual co-enactment is here termed ‘e-motional memory’ (from the root sense ‘out-of-motion’ and the folk sense of ‘being moved by’). In face-to-face learning situations this entails sensorimotor reversal of what has been seen done by the other – entailing a shift from the other-centred frame of reference entailing resonance with what the model has been doing, to the self-centred frame of reference required for execution of the re-enactment, i.e., a shift from altercentric to egocentric body co-ordinates."

      "text": "As for my prediction that neural cells or a neural system supporting such altercentric participant perception would be discovered, an impetus was afforded by [[John O’Keefe]] at a King’s College Research Centre Workshop on the perception of subjects and objects in Cambridge, September 1992. Here, referring to evidence of so called ‘place cells’, he raised the issue of the relation between egocentric [[maps]] and allocentric maps in animals retrieving hidden foods. In conjunction with my virtual other postulate and with Trevarthen’s having posited an alteroceptive capacity in infants (as a complement to their proprioceptive capacity), here were afforded stepping stones for my later identification of altercentric participation. At the Cambridge workshop, upon my presentation of the minimal organizational prerequisites for the formation of schematic means for simulating the other, the theory of mind advocate [[Jean Heal]] asked me whether I regarded the modes of felt immediacy and simulational mediacy to be mutually exclusive. I replied then in the positive. Today, in line with the intersubjective “staircase” outlined in Figure 3.1 and specified in the Part III, I would have been more nuanced in my reply: while verbal conversation (at the second order layer of tertiary intersubjectivity) occurs in representational mediacy and may entail reflective mind-reading, it may evoke also more empathic simulation of mind. And, then, that would clearly be supported by the underlying mode of felt immediacy, operative at the layer of primary intersubjectivity."

For example, when subjects with autism are asked to “Do as I do” and understand the invitation, they have difficulties in matching the model’s gesture, incapable of carrying out the required perceptual mirror reversal entailed by altercentric participant perception. Simple examples are raising arms, grasp thumb, or peck-a-boo (cf. Bråten 1998a; Whiten & Brown 1998). In this connection I thank [[Peter Hobson]] for his recent acknowledgment of my explanatory prediction of perceptual mirror reversal deficit in autism which I voiced in July and August 1994, respectively in Paris and Oslo."

        "text": "As for my prediction that neural cells or a neural system supporting such altercentric participant perception would be discovered, an impetus was afforded by [[John O’Keefe]] at a King’s College Research Centre Workshop on the perception of subjects and objects in Cambridge, September 1992. Here, referring to evidence of so called ‘place cells’, he raised the issue of the relation between egocentric [[maps]] and allocentric maps in animals retrieving hidden foods. In conjunction with my virtual other postulate and with Trevarthen’s having posited an alteroceptive capacity in infants (as a complement to their proprioceptive capacity), here were afforded stepping stones for my later identification of altercentric participation. At the Cambridge workshop, upon my presentation of the minimal organizational prerequisites for the formation of schematic means for simulating the other, the theory of mind advocate Jean Heal asked me whether I regarded the modes of felt immediacy and simulational mediacy to be mutually exclusive. I replied then in the positive. Today, in line with the intersubjective “staircase” outlined in Figure 3.1 and specified in the Part III, I would have been more nuanced in my reply: while verbal conversation (at the second order layer of tertiary intersubjectivity) occurs in representational mediacy and may entail reflective mind-reading, it may evoke also more empathic simulation of mind. And, then, that would clearly be supported by the underlying mode of felt immediacy, operative at the layer of primary intersubjectivity."

For example, when subjects with autism are asked to “Do as I do” and understand the invitation, they have difficulties in matching the model’s gesture, incapable of carrying out the required perceptual mirror reversal entailed by altercentric participant perception. Simple examples are raising arms, grasp thumb, or peck-a-boo (cf. Bråten 1998a; Whiten & Brown 1998). In this connection I thank Peter Hobson for his recent acknowledgment of my explanatory prediction of perceptual mirror reversal deficit in autism which I voiced in July and August 1994, respectively in Paris and Oslo."
