Before doing that I wanted to understand thoroughly how a BlParallelAnimation works. So I created a subclass overriding the method doStep – method that as far as I understood is the one that runs the animations added to a BlParallelAnimation – and I added a Transcript show to it.

Is the issue synchronizing animations with sound?  To your earlier message about animations with delay, seems like you have that working and there are examples in the image that do this (see [[BlAnimationExamples]]>>#bouncingText).\nI'd consider using Announcements and event handlers to trigger different things and keep them in sync. Have you used these before?"
