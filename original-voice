      "text": "so you can't go to jazz sax class or detective writing class and find your voice but yet there if you take the if you look at people's process and you take the stuff out of it there's still some markers that I've discovered along the way this is a key one noticing oh you can't quite see it it says notice notice is the doorway what you [[notice]] is the key to your stuff and you know like even like right now or if we went out on the street everything's happening but you're gonna hear something you're gonna see something you're gonna all just even just that you even notice anything is a link to your your own voice and the the first thing to do is notice what you notice so it's this weird kind of helpful self-consciousness and what I try to do and I'm gonna just go through a couple of my examples really quickly I won't go through them all I kind of think of myself as a factory that's got all these physical and emotional and mental things and I just kind of watch myself and so oh look I really like it when the chords go up but the voice leaps down I don't know why I don't care why why doesn't mean anything to me I just noticed that if it's a female voice I get it's more I don't know why so I we're going to talk about the toolbox in a second so I noticed that and I put it in my toolbox the other thing that I noticed that I really like is when I'm flipping the radio only time I listen to the radio is in the car I'm flipping through the radio and I flip and there's a song usually beginning and I can't tell what's happening I don't know what key it's in the rhythm feels all weird and then before it settles in there's just a bliss for me about that kind of - sorted ungrounded nests so I noticed that I love it you can't program it in except where musicians so that's kind of one of the things I like so I tap into it they have the we have the anti notice which which for me is when you notice more in your field because this stuff applies to any field when you notice that there's something missing in the field even that you would notice that something is missing means it's probably for you so one example I had when I was in college years ago and I was really grooving on Steve Reich and Philip Glass in the early days and I thought you know what nobody's this kind of music it does this pulsing amazing rhythmic thing but nobody's doing it with the full-blown romantic orchestra not romantic in a sense with just the big orchestra and I thought well that kind of looks like if nobody's doing it then I got to do it so I started kind of working on how orchestration works and this and that and then somebody played me this john adams record the guy who wrote the opera nixon in china one of the strangest i won't be derogatory but one of the weirdest operas he played me this early record I was like that guy totally did it he totally did the Steve Reich equals romantic orchestra ring so for me it was like okay that's done I don't need to do it thank God I don't need to do it he's already 10 years ahead of me I wouldn't be that good at it but III it was a kind of a key like oh I see something's missing so I'll go that way I'm probably going to move on here so we can get further on but the the the second bottom one improvisation must be the solution is one thing that I discovered that in my working strategies when when I was younger and I used to record on a four-track cassette if you guys ever remember that proof that sound quality and music aren't really connected actually because I used to listen to a cassette in my car with the windows down the vinyl recorded to cassette on my car did I not hear music I heard music just fine what I used to do was I would make a recording project and I would have a four bar section where I didn't know what I would do there this is the days or you can't cut it out so I had to come up with a solution so in the process I would either improvise or compose something in there as the piece went on and I was forced to stretch myself I noticed I like that it goes in my toolbox and the kind of culmination of that is this record I did about a year and a half ago where a drummer gave me 50 one-minute drum solo if you can believe that I hate drum solos two minutes is enough for me but Markos amazing drummer and he talked me into it and I wrote an entire record to his 51 minute drum solo actually seven of us did there's seven complete records and it was the hardest thing I ever did and I realized this goes back to my original recordings where I gave myself this unbelievable challenge and it just got worse and worse or better and better because the results are fantastic it works for me so moving on how do you develop it and once you notice these things okay so you take all these little noticing things and you put them in your toolbox and what I mean by a toolbox I mean you have to have some way to keep track of your ideas otherwise you can't develop them you're just like relying on your mnemonic sense which is not very efficient at least for me at least at this age but even as a kid it didn't work that well so the toolbox is like in a way it's trickier for musicians you know a writer can write ideas down a painter can have a sketchbook musicians you can't you can record things but you can't really look at two audio recordings at the same time so I'm just I brought here what my toolbox looks right now looks like right now and it's really just a list of my devices things that I do not only that I like but I do so I have rhythm melody harmony orchestration and form and there's different things in here that I like certain ways that I like harmony certain kinds of rhythmic things that are in my vocabulary that I've said oh I like this I want to pursue this I'm good at this thing and so now I have this little toolbox and whenever I'm working I grab a couple of those things and run with them as opposed to grabbing somebody else's things just the fact that they're on here makes them more mine than yours right yours your list would look completely utterly different and what you would make from this as opposed to taking vocabulary off the shelf is going to be more yours and as you kind of refine this that you start to notice there's something underlying these things there's something underlying the way arisen excites me that's just me and not anybody else so that's how you go that's one way to work with the toolbox genre worked is kind of what I call is kind of the opposite of this genre work is where you do you make something that's already been made before and we all know romantic comedies detective novels light jazz country-western I'm not saying that you shouldn't do those things maybe that's where your voice is whatever I'm just saying that if you're heading down your own path you have to be really careful messing with this stuff that in a certain at certain points along the way you have to let stuff go that's not serving your aim for your own authenticity for me I kind of built in a thing by by playing a strange instrument I changed my tuning actually in 1986 2/5 bass tuning instead of fourth base I can't play anything that I used to play and as soon as I pick up a regular guitar the Allman Brothers licks come right out and and Leonard Skynyrd which is not my voice so I kind of like to protect myself another way of protecting yourself is not going to romantic comedy if you want to do something else but you got to make money sometimes so sometimes I dip in I do dip into it I do a lot of I've done a lot of stuff for TV but I always try to bring something from my toolbox in there a little I don't know a little rhythm a little the way that I use har I'm actually not very good at Jean rewriting some people are really great at it so they could have a different opinion but that's my opinion now the other thing is just to make tons of stuff I think we probably all know that but it's hard to it's hard to make ourselves believe it even me like I think that that at least when you're developing your idea a new idea you think it's really precious and you have to take care of it but the truth is if you just make a hundred of them you get really good at it it's proven actually and then the the next thing that I like to use and I notice other people using is you you've got all these things in your toolbox but now you want to actually make something and what I find is people if you have a great burning question you're you're set and here's some examples of some questions I have my own these are not made up these are people I know and worked with or actually coaching clients I work with number four can the rhythms speed up and slow down but stay on the grid this is a very amusing thing some of you guys may not know what I'm talking about but basically if the pulse is going that that that that this drummer came to me with that question like how can you do that how do you do it should I do it is it a good idea or a bad idea I don't I don't know I don't care about whether I mean any idea is a good idea so we worked with that and he's a perfect example of how if you take a question and just pursue it and run with it you end up with a body of work it's this it's the most direct method we tried to answer his question and it actually didn't sound that great but in the process he discovered something else and he ended up rebuilding his drum kit to be to complete small drum kits that he played with his right and left side of his body and built a whole vocabulary of playing different rhythms on the right and left side of his body and came up with this great percolating amazing groove music and has written about an hour's worth of music now now after about a year and a half he's onto this question and it sounds really different than a year and a half ago he's got his body and experience with it I'm just gonna raise you a couple of questions I have worked with how to write instrumental music that is neither jazz or classically structured these are very Muzo but I'm amused oh so I really wanted to do instrumental music that didn't sound like jazz or classical as soon as you put a voice on something it becomes instantly interesting take the voice away and now you're left with this incredible challenge of how do you make it engaging different people have had those answers and now we can pull those off the shelf so I was looking at ways to to challenge myself I think I have come up with answers I'm very interested in story so some of my questions that I pursued how does a storyteller speak so that the story is the audience's story and on and on and on how do you how do you have drumming without sounding like a drum kit how do you bring an audience into alert state and into an end into an alert state these if you pursue them you end up with a body of music or film or whatever I see my four-minute mark coming okay now you've made your amazing thing and you're ready to present it James doesn't even have a clock out he doesn't even know presenting is really simple selling your thing is really simple you guys ready for the key it's so simple there's really nothing more than you need to know is this that's it that's your key anything less than that is just Hollow height and we all see through it and we're all we all have access to the entire history of recorded music film books why not make something amazing failing that on the pathway at least be  authentic because that's your best chance of at least being unique right so that's my but I do have one little business thing here actually when James and I first started talking about this talk I had a lot of industry things and I put them in because I thought that's what you guys would want to hear cuz you know this is an industry thing and James is like screw that this is that let's go for that to meet here so but I do have one little point here you can't you can't be an artist in any way unless you're financially independent that does not mean rich that just means you're outgoing money is way lower than your incoming there's no way no other way to do it in in my field you don't make any money for six to 24 months on any project so not only do you have to overlap but you have to be able to live for six to twelve months with nothing coming in so generally that means cutting your expenses and doing everything as cheap as possible nowadays we can do that better so that's my little my one business tip I see the three-minute mark how are we doing okay so establishing yourself and I'm doing an overview here obviously at this point persistence persistence persistence this is a clip from yawns Fink Meyer do you guys know this filmmaker so spank Meyer is a guy who's a perfect example of this you don't know if his films or cartoons or what he uses claymation he uses stop action humans he used live-action humans he in his film Faust which is incredibly uses puppets life-sized puppets many puppets everything to tell this story and he's just been relentless in this path developing it not everything do I like but who cares and that I actually got this term the person's persistence of vision because when I was living in New Mexico I was at the Taos Film Festival and they have a persistence of vision award and they gave it to Swank Meyer of the year I was there and he you know he exemplifies that better than anyone I know so if you persist hopefully the world will embrace you but you know what if they don't who gives a  right [Applause] okay original voice I'm I I think I'm fairly well resisted being esoteric here I'm just gonna zip by this why is that original voice do we think of as first I have no answer for you you ponder that okay why do that why go this way why do this path there's a lot easier paths the challenges are crazy actually and they're great but there are challenges these are a few and one of the things that I get with my coaching clients is after six months or 12 months were work they were still working on idea like man is this is this how long it takes I might there's something wrong with me am I going too slow you know it's like I feel like I've just been working myself down into a hole and I was like yeah that's what it's like that's what it's like and they're like well it must get better I was like no it doesn't get any better actually the more you go the more uncomfortable it gets and and not just not just the financial uncertainty really I mean that's whatever but just this the sense of do I am I on the right path do I know what I'm doing what I made back then was cool and I don't know about this so so there we go are there rewards you bet there's rewards look at them [Applause] okay on to the real rewards I think the most important thing is that you get to do what only you do as opposed to trying to ape somebody else's path you know how can you beat that it sucks if nobody calls you for that well then you just make your own but you know if you persist you get you get called for what you can do and it is true that if you work towards your own authenticity you have a longer path otherwise you're just jumping John Ross and and why in my view why do something that someone else has done probably there's people out there who do it better than you unless you're the freakin best light jazz saxophone player in the world I don't know no derogatory to all you jazz saxophone players there but just an easy pick so I like jazz too so that's it guys so found it again no need to pit yourselves that was real you've all earned your BFA and thank you for tray guns so much for doing that do you guys want to hear another performance were your oyster [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause]"

        "text": "I play a very unusual instrument and I play it in an unusual way what what you heard tonight so far was there aren't too many people who can do it there's a few there's a half a dozen of us maybe but only one guy really does it like that and 25 years ago when I first started playing an instrument almost like this I had no conception of what I just did now 15 years ago I had maybe a little inkling and I've just kind of been crawling towards it so that's kind of one of the things I want to impart here tonight we're gonna start with my biases I have two biases at least two that I can think of tonight one is that to find your own way is more valuable than going some other somebody else's other way that's my bias hopefully we can dip into more than lip service to that my other bias is that people have a tendency to think that smart people think up clever things and that makes them original and I think that's total they just work and they find an idea that's core to their Center that's authentic to them and they just work it and work it and work it and eventually you start here with everyone else and then eventually you're over here and then you just keep going if you keep going because your voice kind of develops anyway so those are my two biases we're talking about original voice which in a way is absurd that we're even having this conversation because how can you not be authentic right well but yet we know some people feel more authentic than other people and some people have their voice more honed my my view is that they've just taken it and gone further and they've materialized it and they've formed it probably better than others one of the disadvantages you have or one of the things that takes you away from your authentic voice is almost anything that comes from the outside so any market forces any peer pressure any anything from outside probably isn't helpful to you because what I'm talking about is doing something that's never been done before so where can you look for it nowhere except for this path that I'm suggesting so it's a little it's a little absurd of conversation but we're having it anyway so where do you look the first thing is where do you look and for me what I've discovered I should add in here also not only do I play this strange instrument but I've been coaching artists in the creative process for about four years now mostly musicians but a couple of painters so I'm going to be drawing on examples from these guys as well because I've what what I what I what I'm what I'm on about here is that there is no map to go where no one's been before so you can't go to jazz sax class or detective writing class and find your voice but yet there if you take the if you look at people's process and you take the stuff out of it there's still some markers that I've discovered along the way this is a key one noticing oh you can't quite see it it says notice notice is the doorway what you notice is the key to your stuff and you know like even like right now or if we went out on the street everything's happening but you're gonna hear something you're gonna see something you're gonna all just even just that you even notice anything is a link to your your own voice and the the first thing to do is notice what you notice so it's this weird kind of helpful self-consciousness and what I try to do and I'm gonna just go through a couple of my examples really quickly I won't go through them all I kind of think of myself as a factory that's got all these physical and emotional and mental things and I just kind of watch myself and so oh look I really like it when the chords go up but the voice leaps down I don't know why I don't care why why doesn't mean anything to me I just noticed that if it's a female voice I get it's more I don't know why so I we're going to talk about the toolbox in a second so I noticed that and I put it in my toolbox the other thing that I noticed that I really like is when I'm flipping the radio only time I listen to the radio is in the car I'm flipping through the radio and I flip and there's a song usually beginning and I can't tell what's happening I don't know what key it's in the rhythm feels all weird and then before it settles in there's just a bliss for me about that kind of - sorted ungrounded nests so I noticed that I love it you can't program it in except where musicians so that's kind of one of the things I like so I tap into it they have the we have the anti notice which which for me is when you notice more in your field because this stuff applies to any field when you notice that there's something missing in the field even that you would notice that something is missing means it's probably for you so one example I had when I was in college years ago and I was really grooving on Steve Reich and Philip Glass in the early days and I thought you know what nobody's this kind of music it does this pulsing amazing rhythmic thing but nobody's doing it with the full-blown romantic orchestra not romantic in a sense with just the big orchestra and I thought well that kind of looks like if nobody's doing it then I got to do it so I started kind of working on how orchestration works and this and that and then somebody played me this john adams record the guy who wrote the opera nixon in china one of the strangest i won't be derogatory but one of the weirdest operas he played me this early record I was like that guy totally did it he totally did the Steve Reich equals romantic orchestra ring so for me it was like okay that's done I don't need to do it thank God I don't need to do it he's already 10 years ahead of me I wouldn't be that good at it but III it was a kind of a key like oh I see something's missing so I'll go that way I'm probably going to move on here so we can get further on but the the the second bottom one improvisation must be the solution is one thing that I discovered that in my working strategies when when I was younger and I used to record on a four-track cassette if you guys ever remember that proof that sound quality and music aren't really connected actually because I used to listen to a cassette in my car with the windows down the vinyl recorded to cassette on my car did I not hear music I heard music just fine what I used to do was I would make a recording project and I would have a four bar section where I didn't know what I would do there this is the days or you can't cut it out so I had to come up with a solution so in the process I would either improvise or compose something in there as the piece went on and I was forced to stretch myself I noticed I like that it goes in my toolbox and the kind of culmination of that is this record I did about a year and a half ago where a drummer gave me 50 one-minute drum solo if you can believe that I hate drum solos two minutes is enough for me but Markos amazing drummer and he talked me into it and I wrote an entire record to his 51 minute drum solo actually seven of us did there's seven complete records and it was the hardest thing I ever did and I realized this goes back to my original recordings where I gave myself this unbelievable challenge and it just got worse and worse or better and better because the results are fantastic it works for me so moving on how do you develop it and once you notice these things okay so you take all these little noticing things and you put them in your toolbox and what I mean by a toolbox I mean you have to have some way to keep track of your ideas otherwise you can't develop them you're just like relying on your mnemonic sense which is not very efficient at least for me at least at this age but even as a kid it didn't work that well so the toolbox is like in a way it's trickier for musicians you know a writer can write ideas down a painter can have a sketchbook musicians you can't you can record things but you can't really look at two audio recordings at the same time so I'm just I brought here what my toolbox looks right now looks like right now and it's really just a list of my devices things that I do not only that I like but I do so I have rhythm melody harmony orchestration and form and there's different things in here that I like certain ways that I like harmony certain kinds of rhythmic things that are in my vocabulary that I've said oh I like this I want to pursue this I'm good at this thing and so now I have this little toolbox and whenever I'm working I grab a couple of those things and run with them as opposed to grabbing somebody else's things just the fact that they're on here makes them more mine than yours right yours your list would look completely utterly different and what you would make from this as opposed to taking vocabulary off the shelf is going to be more yours and as you kind of refine this that you start to notice there's something underlying these things there's something underlying the way arisen excites me that's just me and not anybody else so that's how you go that's one way to work with the toolbox genre worked is kind of what I call is kind of the opposite of this genre work is where you do you make something that's already been made before and we all know romantic comedies detective novels light jazz country-western I'm not saying that you shouldn't do those things maybe that's where your voice is whatever I'm just saying that if you're heading down your own path you have to be really careful messing with this stuff that in a certain at certain points along the way you have to let stuff go that's not serving your aim for your own authenticity for me I kind of built in a thing by by playing a strange instrument I changed my tuning actually in 1986 2/5 bass tuning instead of fourth base I can't play anything that I used to play and as soon as I pick up a regular guitar the Allman Brothers licks come right out and and Leonard Skynyrd which is not my voice so I kind of like to protect myself another way of protecting yourself is not going to romantic comedy if you want to do something else but you got to make money sometimes so sometimes I dip in I do dip into it I do a lot of I've done a lot of stuff for TV but I always try to bring something from my toolbox in there a little I don't know a little rhythm a little the way that I use har I'm actually not very good at Jean rewriting some people are really great at it so they could have a different opinion but that's my opinion now the other thing is just to make tons of stuff I think we probably all know that but it's hard to it's hard to make ourselves believe it even me like I think that that at least when you're developing your idea a new idea you think it's really precious and you have to take care of it but the truth is if you just make a hundred of them you get really good at it it's proven actually and then the the next thing that I like to use and I notice other people using is you you've got all these things in your toolbox but now you want to actually make something and what I find is people if you have a great burning question you're you're set and here's some examples of some questions I have my own these are not made up these are people I know and worked with or actually coaching clients I work with number four can the rhythms speed up and slow down but stay on the grid this is a very amusing thing some of you guys may not know what I'm talking about but basically if the pulse is going that that that that this drummer came to me with that question like how can you do that how do you do it should I do it is it a good idea or a bad idea I don't I don't know I don't care about whether I mean any idea is a good idea so we worked with that and he's a perfect example of how if you take a question and just pursue it and run with it you end up with a body of work it's this it's the most direct method we tried to answer his question and it actually didn't sound that great but in the process he discovered something else and he ended up rebuilding his drum kit to be to complete small drum kits that he played with his right and left side of his body and built a whole vocabulary of playing different rhythms on the right and left side of his body and came up with this great percolating amazing groove music and has written about an hour's worth of music now now after about a year and a half he's onto this question and it sounds really different than a year and a half ago he's got his body and experience with it I'm just gonna raise you a couple of questions I have worked with how to write instrumental music that is neither jazz or classically structured these are very Muzo but I'm amused oh so I really wanted to do instrumental music that didn't sound like jazz or classical as soon as you put a voice on something it becomes instantly interesting take the voice away and now you're left with this incredible challenge of how do you make it engaging different people have had those answers and now we can pull those off the shelf so I was looking at ways to to challenge myself I think I have come up with answers I'm very interested in story so some of my questions that I pursued how does a storyteller speak so that the story is the audience's story and on and on and on how do you how do you have drumming without sounding like a drum kit how do you bring an audience into alert state and into an end into an alert state these if you pursue them you end up with a body of music or film or whatever I see my four-minute mark coming okay now you've made your amazing thing and you're ready to present it James doesn't even have a clock out he doesn't even know presenting is really simple selling your thing is really simple you guys ready for the key it's so simple there's really nothing more than you need to know is this that's it that's your key anything less than that is just Hollow height and we all see through it and we're all we all have access to the entire history of recorded music film books why not make something amazing failing that on the pathway at least be  authentic because that's your best chance of at least being unique right so that's my but I do have one little business thing here actually when James and I first started talking about this talk I had a lot of industry things and I put them in because I thought that's what you guys would want to hear cuz you know this is an industry thing and James is like screw that this is that let's go for that to meet here so but I do have one little point here you can't you can't be an artist in any way unless you're financially independent that does not mean rich that just means you're outgoing money is way lower than your incoming there's no way no other way to do it in in my field you don't make any money for six to 24 months on any project so not only do you have to overlap but you have to be able to live for six to twelve months with nothing coming in so generally that means cutting your expenses and doing everything as cheap as possible nowadays we can do that better so that's my little my one business tip I see the three-minute mark how are we doing okay so establishing yourself and I'm doing an overview here obviously at this point persistence persistence persistence this is a clip from yawns Fink Meyer do you guys know this filmmaker so spank Meyer is a guy who's a perfect example of this you don't know if his films or cartoons or what he uses claymation he uses stop action humans he used live-action humans he in his film Faust which is incredibly uses puppets life-sized puppets many puppets everything to tell this story and he's just been relentless in this path developing it not everything do I like but who cares and that I actually got this term the person's persistence of vision because when I was living in New Mexico I was at the Taos Film Festival and they have a persistence of vision award and they gave it to Swank Meyer of the year I was there and he you know he exemplifies that better than anyone I know so if you persist hopefully the world will embrace you but you know what if they don't who gives a  right [Applause] okay original voice I'm I I think I'm fairly well resisted being esoteric here I'm just gonna zip by this why is that original voice do we think of as first I have no answer for you you ponder that okay why do that why go this way why do this path there's a lot easier paths the challenges are crazy actually and they're great but there are challenges these are a few and one of the things that I get with my coaching clients is after six months or 12 months were work they were still working on idea like man is this is this how long it takes I might there's something wrong with me am I going too slow you know it's like I feel like I've just been working myself down into a hole and I was like yeah that's what it's like that's what it's like and they're like well it must get better I was like no it doesn't get any better actually the more you go the more uncomfortable it gets and and not just not just the financial uncertainty really I mean that's whatever but just this the sense of do I am I on the right path do I know what I'm doing what I made back then was cool and I don't know about this so so there we go are there rewards you bet there's rewards look at them [Applause] okay on to the real rewards I think the most important thing is that you get to do what only you do as opposed to trying to ape somebody else's path you know how can you beat that it sucks if nobody calls you for that well then you just make your own but you know if you persist you get you get called for what you can do and it is true that if you work towards your own authenticity you have a longer path otherwise you're just jumping John Ross and and why in my view why do something that someone else has done probably there's people out there who do it better than you unless you're the freakin best light jazz saxophone player in the world I don't know no derogatory to all you jazz saxophone players there but just an easy pick so I like jazz too so that's it guys so found it again no need to pit yourselves that was real you've all earned your BFA and thank you for tray guns so much for doing that do you guys want to hear another performance were your oyster [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause]"

        "text": "right well but yet we know some people feel more authentic than other people and some people have their voice more honed my my view is that they've just taken it and gone further and they've materialized it and they've formed it probably better than others one of the disadvantages you have or one of the things that takes you away from your authentic voice is almost anything that comes from the outside so any market forces any peer pressure any anything from outside probably isn't helpful to you because what I'm talking about is doing something that's never been done before so where can you look for it nowhere except for this path that I'm suggesting so it's a little it's a little absurd of conversation but we're having it anyway so where do you look the first thing is where do you look and for me what I've discovered I should add in here also not only do I play this strange instrument but I've been coaching artists in the creative process for about four years now mostly musicians but a couple of painters so I'm going to be drawing on examples from these guys as well because I've what what I what I what I'm what I'm on about here is that there is no map to go where no one's been before so you can't go to jazz sax class or detective writing class and find your voice but yet there if you take the if you look at people's process and you take the stuff out of it there's still some markers that I've discovered along the way this is a key one noticing oh you can't quite see it it says notice notice is the doorway what you notice is the key to your stuff and you know like even like right now or if we went out on the street everything's happening but you're gonna hear something you're gonna see something you're gonna all just even just that you even notice anything is a link to your your own voice and the the first thing to do is notice what you notice so it's this weird kind of helpful self-consciousness and what I try to do and I'm gonna just go through a couple of my examples really quickly I won't go through them all I kind of think of myself as a factory that's got all these physical and emotional and mental things and I just kind of watch myself and so oh look I really like it when the chords go up but the voice leaps down I don't know why I don't care why why doesn't mean anything to me I just noticed that if it's a female voice I get it's more I don't know why so I we're going to talk about the toolbox in a second so I noticed that and I put it in my toolbox the other thing that I noticed that I really like is when I'm flipping the radio only time I listen to the radio is in the car I'm flipping through the radio and I flip and there's a song usually beginning and I can't tell what's happening I don't know what key it's in the rhythm feels all weird and then before it settles in there's just a bliss for me about that kind of - sorted ungrounded nests so I noticed that I love it you can't program it in except where musicians so that's kind of one of the things I like so I tap into it they have the we have the anti notice which which for me is when you notice more in your field because this stuff applies to any field when you notice that there's something missing in the field even that you would notice that something is missing means it's probably for you so one example I had when I was in college years ago and I was really grooving on Steve Reich and Philip Glass in the early days and I thought you know what nobody's this kind of music it does this pulsing amazing rhythmic thing but nobody's doing it with the full-blown romantic orchestra not romantic in a sense with just the big orchestra and I thought well that kind of looks like if nobody's doing it then I got to do it so I started kind of working on how orchestration works and this and that and then somebody played me this john adams record the guy who wrote the opera nixon in china one of the strangest i won't be derogatory but one of the weirdest operas he played me this early record I was like that guy totally did it he totally did the Steve Reich equals romantic orchestra ring so for me it was like okay that's done I don't need to do it thank God I don't need to do it he's already 10 years ahead of me I wouldn't be that good at it but III it was a kind of a key like oh I see something's missing so I'll go that way I'm probably going to move on here so we can get further on but the the the second bottom one improvisation must be the solution is one thing that I discovered that in my working strategies when when I was younger and I used to record on a four-track cassette if you guys ever remember that proof that sound quality and music aren't really connected actually because I used to listen to a cassette in my car with the windows down the vinyl recorded to cassette on my car did I not hear music I heard music just fine what I used to do was I would make a recording project and I would have a four bar section where I didn't know what I would do there this is the days or you can't cut it out so I had to come up with a solution so in the process I would either improvise or compose something in there as the piece went on and I was forced to stretch myself I noticed I like that it goes in my toolbox and the kind of culmination of that is this record I did about a year and a half ago where a drummer gave me 50 one-minute drum solo if you can believe that I hate drum solos two minutes is enough for me but Markos amazing drummer and he talked me into it and I wrote an entire record to his 51 minute drum solo actually seven of us did there's seven complete records and it was the hardest thing I ever did and I realized this goes back to my original recordings where I gave myself this unbelievable challenge and it just got worse and worse or better and better because the results are fantastic it works for me so moving on how do you develop it and once you notice these things okay so you take all these little noticing things and you put them in your toolbox and what I mean by a toolbox I mean you have to have some way to keep track of your ideas otherwise you can't develop them you're just like relying on your mnemonic sense which is not very efficient at least for me at least at this age but even as a kid it didn't work that well so the toolbox is like in a way it's trickier for musicians you know a writer can write ideas down a painter can have a sketchbook musicians you can't you can record things but you can't really look at two audio recordings at the same time so I'm just I brought here what my toolbox looks right now looks like right now and it's really just a list of my devices things that I do not only that I like but I do so I have rhythm melody harmony orchestration and form and there's different things in here that I like certain ways that I like harmony certain kinds of rhythmic things that are in my vocabulary that I've said oh I like this I want to pursue this I'm good at this thing and so now I have this little toolbox and whenever I'm working I grab a couple of those things and run with them as opposed to grabbing somebody else's things just the fact that they're on here makes them more mine than yours right yours your list would look completely utterly different and what you would make from this as opposed to taking vocabulary off the shelf is going to be more yours and as you kind of refine this that you start to notice there's something underlying these things there's something underlying the way arisen excites me that's just me and not anybody else so that's how you go that's one way to work with the toolbox genre worked is kind of what I call is kind of the opposite of this genre work is where you do you make something that's already been made before and we all know romantic comedies detective novels light jazz country-western I'm not saying that you shouldn't do those things maybe that's where your voice is whatever I'm just saying that if you're heading down your own path you have to be really careful messing with this stuff that in a certain at certain points along the way you have to let stuff go that's not serving your aim for your own authenticity for me I kind of built in a thing by by playing a strange instrument I changed my tuning actually in 1986 2/5 bass tuning instead of fourth base I can't play anything that I used to play and as soon as I pick up a regular guitar the Allman Brothers licks come right out and and Leonard Skynyrd which is not my voice so I kind of like to protect myself another way of protecting yourself is not going to romantic comedy if you want to do something else but you got to make money sometimes so sometimes I dip in I do dip into it I do a lot of I've done a lot of stuff for TV but I always try to bring something from my toolbox in there a little I don't know a little rhythm a little the way that I use har I'm actually not very good at Jean rewriting some people are really great at it so they could have a different opinion but that's my opinion now the other thing is just to make tons of stuff I think we probably all know that but it's hard to it's hard to make ourselves believe it even me like I think that that at least when you're developing your idea a new idea you think it's really precious and you have to take care of it but the truth is if you just make a hundred of them you get really good at it it's proven actually and then the the next thing that I like to use and I notice other people using is you you've got all these things in your toolbox but now you want to actually make something and what I find is people if you have a great burning question you're you're set and here's some examples of some questions I have my own these are not made up these are people I know and worked with or actually coaching clients I work with number four can the rhythms speed up and slow down but stay on the grid this is a very amusing thing some of you guys may not know what I'm talking about but basically if the pulse is going that that that that this drummer came to me with that question like how can you do that how do you do it should I do it is it a good idea or a bad idea I don't I don't know I don't care about whether I mean any idea is a good idea so we worked with that and he's a perfect example of how if you take a question and just pursue it and run with it you end up with a body of work it's this it's the most direct method we tried to answer his question and it actually didn't sound that great but in the process he discovered something else and he ended up rebuilding his drum kit to be to complete small drum kits that he played with his right and left side of his body and built a whole vocabulary of playing different rhythms on the right and left side of his body and came up with this great percolating amazing groove music and has written about an hour's worth of music now now after about a year and a half he's onto this question and it sounds really different than a year and a half ago he's got his body and experience with it I'm just gonna raise you a couple of questions I have worked with how to write instrumental music that is neither jazz or classically structured these are very Muzo but I'm amused oh so I really wanted to do instrumental music that didn't sound like jazz or classical as soon as you put a voice on something it becomes instantly interesting take the voice away and now you're left with this incredible challenge of how do you make it engaging different people have had those answers and now we can pull those off the shelf so I was looking at ways to to challenge myself I think I have come up with answers I'm very interested in story so some of my questions that I pursued how does a storyteller speak so that the story is the audience's story and on and on and on how do you how do you have drumming without sounding like a drum kit how do you bring an audience into alert state and into an end into an alert state these if you pursue them you end up with a body of music or film or whatever I see my four-minute mark coming okay now you've made your amazing thing and you're ready to present it James doesn't even have a clock out he doesn't even know presenting is really simple selling your thing is really simple you guys ready for the key it's so simple there's really nothing more than you need to know is this that's it that's your key anything less than that is just Hollow height and we all see through it and we're all we all have access to the entire history of recorded music film books why not make something amazing failing that on the pathway at least be  authentic because that's your best chance of at least being unique right so that's my but I do have one little business thing here actually when James and I first started talking about this talk I had a lot of industry things and I put them in because I thought that's what you guys would want to hear cuz you know this is an industry thing and James is like screw that this is that let's go for that to meet here so but I do have one little point here you can't you can't be an artist in any way unless you're financially independent that does not mean rich that just means you're outgoing money is way lower than your incoming there's no way no other way to do it in in my field you don't make any money for six to 24 months on any project so not only do you have to overlap but you have to be able to live for six to twelve months with nothing coming in so generally that means cutting your expenses and doing everything as cheap as possible nowadays we can do that better so that's my little my one business tip I see the three-minute mark how are we doing okay so establishing yourself and I'm doing an overview here obviously at this point persistence persistence persistence this is a clip from yawns Fink Meyer do you guys know this filmmaker so spank Meyer is a guy who's a perfect example of this you don't know if his films or cartoons or what he uses claymation he uses stop action humans he used live-action humans he in his film Faust which is incredibly uses puppets life-sized puppets many puppets everything to tell this story and he's just been relentless in this path developing it not everything do I like but who cares and that I actually got this term the person's persistence of vision because when I was living in New Mexico I was at the Taos Film Festival and they have a persistence of vision award and they gave it to Swank Meyer of the year I was there and he you know he exemplifies that better than anyone I know so if you persist hopefully the world will embrace you but you know what if they don't who gives a  right [Applause] okay original voice I'm I I think I'm fairly well resisted being esoteric here I'm just gonna zip by this why is that original voice do we think of as first I have no answer for you you ponder that okay why do that why go this way why do this path there's a lot easier paths the challenges are crazy actually and they're great but there are challenges these are a few and one of the

the sense of do I am I on the right path do I know what I'm doing what I made back then was cool and I don't know about this so so there we go are there rewards you bet there's rewards look at them [Applause] okay on to the real rewards I think the most important thing is that you get to do what only you do as opposed to trying to ape somebody else's path you know how can you beat that it sucks if nobody calls you for that well then you just make your own but you know if you persist you get you get called for what you can do and it is true that if you work towards your own authenticity you

the second bottom one improvisation must be the solution is one thing that I discovered that in my working strategies when when I was younger and I used to record on a four-track cassette if you guys ever remember that proof that sound quality and music aren't really connected actually because I used to listen to a cassette in my car with the windows down the vinyl recorded to cassette on my car did I not hear music I heard music just fine what I used to do was I would make a recording project and I would have a four bar section where I didn't know what I would do there this is the days or you can't cut it out so I had to come up with a solution so in the process I would either improvise or compose something in there as the piece went on and I was forced to stretch myself I noticed I like that it goes in my toolbox and the kind of culmination of that is this record I did about a year and a half ago where a drummer gave me 50 one-minute drum solo if you can believe that I hate drum solos two minutes is enough for me but Markos amazing drummer and he talked me into it and I wrote an entire record to his 51 minute drum solo actually seven of us did there's seven complete records and it was the hardest thing I ever did and I realized this goes back to my original recordings where I gave myself this unbelievable challenge and it just got worse and worse or better and better because the results are fantastic it works for me so moving on how do you develop it and once you notice these things okay so you take all these little noticing things and you put them in your toolbox and what I mean by a toolbox I mean you have to have some way to keep track of your ideas otherwise you can't develop them you're just like relying on your mnemonic sense which is not very efficient at least for me at least at this age but even as a kid it didn't work that well so the toolbox is like in a way it's trickier for musicians you know a writer can write ideas down a painter can have a sketchbook musicians you can't you can record things but you can't really look at two audio recordings at the same time so I'm just I brought here what my toolbox looks right now looks like right now and it's really just a list of my devices things that I do not only that I like but I do so I have rhythm melody harmony orchestration and form and there's different things in here that I like certain ways that I like harmony certain kinds of rhythmic things that are in my vocabulary that I've said oh I like this I want to pursue this I'm good at this thing and so now I have this little toolbox and whenever I'm working I grab a couple of those things and run with them as opposed to grabbing somebody else's things just the fact that they're on here makes them more mine than yours right yours your list would look completely utterly different and what you would make from this as opposed to taking vocabulary off the shelf is going to be more yours and as you kind of refine this that you start to notice there's something underlying these things there's something underlying the way arisen excites me that's just me and not anybody else so that's how you go that's one way to work with the toolbox genre worked is kind of what I call is kind of the opposite of this genre work is where you do you make something that's already been made before and we all know romantic comedies detective novels light jazz country-western I'm not saying that you shouldn't do those things maybe that's where your voice is whatever I'm just saying that if you're heading down your own path you have to be really careful messing with this stuff that in a certain at certain points along the way you have to let stuff go that's not serving your aim for your own authenticity for me I kind of built in a thing by by playing a strange instrument I changed my tuning actually in 1986 2/5 bass tuning instead of fourth base I can't play anything that I used to play and as soon as I pick up a regular guitar the Allman Brothers licks come right out and and Leonard Skynyrd which is not my voice so I kind of like to protect myself another way of protecting yourself is not going to romantic comedy if you want to do something else but you got to make money sometimes so sometimes I dip in I do dip into it I do a lot of I've done a lot of stuff for TV but I always try to bring something from my toolbox in there a little I don't know a little rhythm a little the way that I use har I'm actually not very good at Jean rewriting some people are really great at it so they could have a different opinion but that's my opinion now the other thing is just to make tons of stuff I think we probably all know that but it's hard to it's hard to make ourselves believe it even me like I think that that at least when you're developing your idea a new idea you think it's really precious and you have to take care of it but the truth is if you just make a hundred of them you get really good at it it's proven actually and then the the next thing that I like to use and I notice other people using is you you've got all these things in your toolbox but now you want to actually make something and what I find is people if you have a great burning question you're you're set and here's some examples of some questions I have my own these are not made up these are people I know and worked with or actually coaching clients I work with number four can the rhythms speed up and slow down but stay on the grid this is a very amusing thing some of you guys may not know what I'm talking about but basically if the pulse is going that that that that this drummer came to me with that question like how can you do that how do you do it should I do it is it a good idea or a bad idea I don't I don't know I don't care about whether I mean any idea is a good idea so we worked with that and he's a perfect example of how if you take a question and just pursue it and run with it you end up with a body of work it's this it's the most direct method we tried to answer his question and it actually didn't sound that great but in the process he discovered something else and he ended up rebuilding his drum kit to be to complete small drum kits that he played with his right and left side of his body and built a whole vocabulary of playing different rhythms on the right and left side of his body and came up with this great percolating amazing groove music and has written about an hour's worth of music now now after about a year and a half he's onto this question and it sounds really different than a year and a half ago he's got his body and experience with it I'm just gonna raise you a couple of questions I have worked with how to write instrumental music that is neither jazz or classically structured these are very Muzo but I'm amused oh so I really wanted to do instrumental music that didn't sound like jazz or classical as soon as you put a voice on something it becomes instantly interesting take the voice away and now you're left with this incredible challenge of how do you make it engaging different people have had those answers and now we can pull those off the shelf so I was looking at ways to to challenge myself I think I have come up with answers I'm very interested in story so some of my questions that I pursued how does a storyteller speak so that the story is the audience's story and on and on and on how do you how do you have drumming without sounding like a drum kit how do you bring an audience into alert state and into an end into an alert state these if you pursue them you end up with a body of music or film or whatever I see my four-minute mark coming okay now you've made your amazing thing and you're ready to present it James doesn't even have a clock out he doesn't even know presenting is really simple selling your thing is really simple you guys ready for the key it's so simple there's really nothing more than you need to know is this that's it that's your key anything less than that is just Hollow height and we all see through it and we're all we all have access to the entire history of recorded music film books why not make something amazing failing that on the pathway at least be  authentic because that's your best chance of at least being unique right so that's my but I do have one little business thing here actually when James and I first started talking about this talk I had a lot of industry things and I put them in because I thought that's what you guys would want to hear cuz you know this is an industry thing and James is like screw that this is that let's go for that to meet here so but I do have one little point here you can't you can't be an artist in any way unless you're financially independent that does not mean rich that just means you're outgoing money is way lower than your incoming there's no way no other way to do it in in my field you don't make any money for six to 24 months on any project so not only do you have to overlap but you have to be able to live for six to twelve months with nothing coming in so generally that means cutting your expenses and doing everything as cheap as possible nowadays we can do that better so that's my little my one business tip I see the three-minute mark how are we doing okay so establishing yourself and I'm doing an overview here obviously at this point persistence persistence persistence this is a clip from yawns Fink Meyer do you guys know this filmmaker so spank Meyer is a guy who's a perfect example of this you don't know if his films or cartoons or what he uses claymation he uses stop action humans he used live-action humans he in his film Faust which is incredibly uses puppets life-sized puppets many puppets everything to tell this story and he's just been relentless in this path developing it not everything do I like but who cares and that I actually got this term the person's persistence of vision because when I was living in New Mexico I was at the Taos Film Festival and they have a persistence of vision award and they gave it to Swank Meyer of the year I was there and he you know he exemplifies that better than anyone I know so if you persist hopefully the world will embrace you but you know what if they don't who gives a  right [Applause] okay original voice I'm I I think I'm fairly well resisted being esoteric here I'm just gonna zip by this why is that original voice do we think of as first I have no answer for you you ponder that okay why do that why go this way why do this path there's a lot easier paths the challenges are crazy actually and they're great but there are challenges these are a few and one of the things that I get with my coaching clients is after six months or 12 months were work they were still working on idea like man is this is this how long it takes I might there's something wrong with me am I going too slow you know it's like I feel like I've just been working myself down into a hole and I was like yeah that's what it's like that's what it's like and they're like well it must get better I was like no it doesn't get any better actually the more you go the more uncomfortable it gets and and not just not just the financial uncertainty really I mean that's whatever but just this the sense of do I am I on the right path do I know what I'm doing what I made back then was cool and I don't know about this so so there we go are there rewards you bet there's rewards look at them [Applause] okay on to the real rewards I think the most important thing is that you get to do what only you do as opposed to trying to ape somebody else's path you know how can you beat that it sucks if nobody calls you for that well then you just make your own but you know if you persist you get you get called for what you can do and it is true that if you work towards your own authenticity you have a longer path otherwise you're just jumping John Ross and and why in my view why do something that someone else has done probably there's people out there who do it better than you unless you're the freakin best light jazz saxophone player in the world I don't know no derogatory to all you jazz saxophone players there but just an easy pick so I like jazz too so that's it guys so found it again no need to pit yourselves that was real you've all earned your BFA and thank you for tray guns so much for doing that do you guys want to hear another performance were your oyster [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause]"

        "text": "so you can't go to jazz sax class or detective writing class and find your voice but yet there if you take the if you look at people's process and you take the stuff out of it there's still some markers that I've discovered along the way this is a key one noticing oh you can't quite see it it says notice notice is the doorway what you notice is the key to your stuff and you know like even like right now or if we went out on the street everything's happening but you're gonna hear something you're gonna see something you're gonna all just even just that you even notice anything is a link to your your own voice and the the first thing to do is notice what you notice so it's this weird kind of helpful self-consciousness and what I try to do and I'm gonna just go through a couple of my examples really quickly I won't go through them all I kind of think of myself as a factory that's got all these physical and emotional and mental things and I just kind of watch myself and so oh look I really like it when the chords go up but the voice leaps down I don't know why I don't care why why doesn't mean anything to me I just noticed that if it's a female voice I get it's more I don't know why so I we're going to talk about the toolbox in a second so I noticed that and I put it in my toolbox the other thing that I noticed that I really like is when I'm flipping the radio only time I listen to the radio is in the car I'm flipping through the radio and I flip and there's a song usually beginning and I can't tell what's happening I don't know what key it's in the rhythm feels all weird and then before it settles in there's just a bliss for me about that kind of - sorted ungrounded nests so I noticed that I love it you can't program it in except where musicians so that's kind of one of the things I like so I tap into it they have the we have the anti notice which which for me is when you notice more in your field because this stuff applies to any field when you notice that there's something missing in the field even that you would notice that something is missing means it's probably for you so one example I had when I was in college years ago and I was really grooving on Steve Reich and Philip Glass in the early days and I thought you know what nobody's this kind of music it does this pulsing amazing rhythmic thing but nobody's doing it with the full-blown romantic orchestra not romantic in a sense with just the big orchestra and I thought well that kind of looks like if nobody's doing it then I got to do it so I started kind of working on how orchestration works and this and that and then somebody played me this john adams record the guy who wrote the opera nixon in china one of the strangest i won't be derogatory but one of the weirdest operas he played me this early record I was like that guy totally did it he totally did the Steve Reich equals romantic orchestra ring so for me it was like okay that's done I don't need to do it thank God I don't need to do it he's already 10 years ahead of me I wouldn't be that good at it but III it was a kind of a key like oh I see something's missing so I'll go that way I'm probably

to the real rewards I think the most important thing is that you get to do what only you do as opposed to trying to ape somebody else's path you know how can you beat that it sucks if nobody calls you for that well then you just make your own but you know if you persist you get you get called for what you can do and it is true that if you work towards your own authenticity you have a longer path otherwise you're just jumping John Ross and and why in my view why do something that someone else has done probably there's people out there who do it better than you unless you're the freakin best light jazz saxophone player in the world I don't know no derogatory to all you jazz saxophone players there but just an easy pick so I like jazz too so that's it guys so found it again no need to pit yourselves that was real you've all earned your BFA and thank you for tray guns so much for doing that do you guys want to hear another performance were your oyster [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause]"

        "text": "so you can't go to jazz sax class or detective writing class and find your voice but yet there if you take the if you look at people's process and you take the stuff out of it there's still some markers that I've discovered along the way this is a key one noticing oh you can't quite see it it says notice notice is the doorway what you [[notice]] is the key to your stuff and you know like even like right now or if we went out on the street everything's happening but you're gonna hear something you're gonna see something you're gonna all just even just that you even notice anything is a link to your your own voice and the the first thing to do is notice what you notice so it's this weird kind of helpful self-consciousness and what I try to do and I'm gonna just go through a couple of my examples really quickly I won't go through them all I kind of think of myself as a factory that's got all these physical and emotional and mental things and I just kind of watch myself and so oh look I really like it when the chords go up but the voice leaps down I don't know why I don't care why why doesn't mean anything to me I just noticed that if it's a female voice I get it's more I don't know why so I we're going to talk about the toolbox in a second so I noticed that and I put it in my toolbox the other thing that I noticed that I really like is when I'm flipping the radio only time I listen to the radio is in the car I'm flipping through the radio and I flip and there's a song usually beginning and I can't tell what's happening I don't know what key it's in the rhythm feels all weird and then before it settles in there's just a bliss for me about that kind of - sorted ungrounded nests so I noticed that I love it you can't program it in except where musicians so that's kind of one of the things I like so I tap into it they have the we have the anti notice which which for me is when you notice more in your field because this stuff applies to any field when you notice that there's something missing in the field even that you would notice that something is missing means it's probably for you so one example I had when I was in college years ago and I was really grooving on Steve Reich and Philip Glass in the early days and I thought you know what nobody's this kind of music it does this pulsing amazing rhythmic thing but nobody's doing it with the full-blown romantic orchestra not romantic in a sense with just the big orchestra and I thought well that kind of looks like if nobody's doing it then I got to do it so I started kind of working on how orchestration works and this and that and then somebody played me this john adams record the guy who wrote the opera nixon in china one of the strangest i won't be derogatory but one of the weirdest operas he played me this early record I was like that guy totally did it he totally did the Steve Reich equals romantic orchestra ring so for me it was like okay that's done I don't need to do it thank God I don't need to do it he's already 10 years ahead of me I wouldn't be that good at it but III it was a kind of a key like oh I see something's missing so I'll go that way I'm probably going to move on here so we can get further on but the the the second bottom one improvisation must be the solution is one thing that I discovered that in my working strategies when when I was younger and I used to record on a four-track cassette if you guys ever remember that proof that sound quality and music aren't really connected actually because I used to listen to a cassette in my car with the windows down the vinyl recorded to cassette on my car did I not hear music I heard music just fine what I used to do was I would make a recording project and I would have a four bar section where I didn't know what I would do there this is the days or you can't cut it out so I had to come up with a solution so in the process I would either improvise or compose something in there as the piece went on and I was forced to stretch myself I noticed I like that it goes in my toolbox and the kind of culmination of that is this record I did about a year and a half ago where a drummer gave me 50 one-minute drum solo if you can believe that I hate drum solos two minutes is enough for me but Markos amazing drummer and he talked me into it and I wrote an entire record to his 51 minute drum solo actually seven of us did there's seven complete records and it was the hardest thing I ever did and I realized this goes back to my original recordings where I gave myself this unbelievable challenge and it just got worse and worse or better and better because the results are fantastic it works for me so moving on how do you develop it and once you notice these things okay so you take all these little noticing things and you put them in your toolbox and what I mean by a toolbox I mean you have to have some way to keep track of your ideas otherwise you can't develop them you're just like relying on your mnemonic sense which is not very efficient at least for me at least at this age but even as a kid it didn't work that well so the toolbox is like in a way it's trickier for musicians you know a writer can write ideas down a painter can have a sketchbook musicians you can't you can record things but you can't really look at two audio recordings at the same time so I'm just I brought here what my toolbox looks right now looks like right now and it's really just a list of my devices things that I do not only that I like but I do so I have rhythm melody harmony orchestration and form and there's different things in here that I like certain ways that I like harmony certain kinds of rhythmic things that are in my vocabulary that I've said oh I like this I want to pursue this I'm good at this thing and so now I have this little toolbox and whenever I'm working I grab a couple of those things and run with them as opposed to grabbing somebody else's things just the fact that they're on here makes them more mine than yours right yours your list would look completely utterly different and what you would make from this as opposed to taking vocabulary off the shelf is going to be more yours and as you kind of refine this that you start to notice there's something underlying these things there's something underlying the way arisen excites me that's just me and not anybody else so that's how you go that's one way to work with the toolbox genre worked is kind of what I call is kind of the opposite of this genre work is where you do you make something that's already been made before and we all know romantic comedies detective novels light jazz country-western I'm not saying that you shouldn't do those things maybe that's where your voice is whatever I'm just saying that if you're heading down your own path you have to be really careful messing with this stuff that in a certain at certain points along the way you have to let stuff go that's not serving your aim for your own authenticity for me I kind of built in a thing by by playing a strange instrument I changed my tuning actually in 1986 2/5 bass tuning instead of fourth base I can't play anything that I used to play and as soon as I pick up a regular guitar the Allman Brothers licks come right out and and Leonard Skynyrd which is not my voice so I kind of like to protect myself another way of protecting yourself is not going to romantic comedy if you want to do something else but you got to make money sometimes so sometimes I dip in I do dip into it I do a lot of I've done a lot of stuff for TV but I always try to bring something from my toolbox in there a little I don't know a little rhythm a little the way that I use har I'm actually not very good at Jean rewriting some people are really great at it so they could have a different opinion but that's my opinion now the other thing is just to make tons of stuff I think we probably all know that but it's hard to it's hard to make ourselves believe it even me like I think that that at least when you're developing your idea a new idea you think it's really precious and you have to take care of it but the truth is if you just make a hundred of them you get really good at it it's proven actually and then the the next thing that I like to use and I notice other people using is you you've got all these things in your toolbox but now you want to actually make something and what I find is people if you have a great burning question you're you're set and here's some examples of some questions I have my own these are not made up these are people I know and worked with or actually coaching clients I work with number four can the rhythms speed up and slow down but stay on the grid this is a very amusing thing some of you guys may not know what I'm talking about but basically if the pulse is going that that that that this drummer came to me with that question like how can you do that how do you do it should I do it is it a good idea or a bad idea I don't I don't know I don't care about whether I mean any idea is a good idea so we worked with that and he's a perfect example of how if you take a question and just pursue it and run with it you end up with a body of work it's this it's the most direct method we tried to answer his question and it actually didn't sound that great but in the process he discovered something else and he ended up rebuilding his drum kit to be to complete small drum kits that he played with his right and left side of his body and built a whole vocabulary of playing different rhythms on the right and left side of his body and came up with this great percolating amazing groove music and has written about an hour's worth of music now now after about a year and a half he's onto this question and it sounds really different than a year and a half ago he's got his body and experience with it I'm just gonna raise you a couple of questions I have worked with how to write instrumental music that is neither jazz or classically structured these are very Muzo but I'm amused oh so I really wanted to do instrumental music that didn't sound like jazz or classical as soon as you put a voice on something it becomes instantly interesting take the voice away and now you're left with this incredible challenge of how do you make it engaging different people have had those answers and now we can pull those off the shelf so I was looking at ways to to challenge myself I think I have come up with answers I'm very interested in story so some of my questions that I pursued how does a storyteller speak so that the story is the audience's story and on and on and on how do you how do you have drumming without sounding like a drum kit how do you bring an audience into alert state and into an end into an alert state these if you pursue them you end up with a body of music or film or whatever I see my four-minute mark coming okay now you've made your amazing thing and you're ready to present it James doesn't even have a clock out he doesn't even know presenting is really simple selling your thing is really simple you guys ready for the key it's so simple there's really nothing more than you need to know is this that's it that's your key anything less than that is just Hollow height and we all see through it and we're all we all have access to the entire history of recorded music film books why not make something amazing failing that on the pathway at least be  authentic because that's your best chance of at least being unique right so that's my but I do have one little business thing here actually when James and I first started talking about this talk I had a lot of industry things and I put them in because I thought that's what you guys would want to hear cuz you know this is an industry thing and James is like screw that this is that let's go for that to meet here so but I do have one little point here you can't you can't be an artist in any way unless you're financially independent that does not mean rich that just means you're outgoing money is way lower than your incoming there's no way no other way to do it in in my field you don't make any money for six to 24 months on any project so not only do you have to overlap but you have to be able to live for six to twelve months with nothing coming in so generally that means cutting your expenses and doing everything as cheap as possible nowadays we can do that better so that's my little my one business tip I see the three-minute mark how are we doing okay so establishing yourself and I'm doing an overview here obviously at this point persistence persistence persistence this is a clip from yawns Fink Meyer do you guys know this filmmaker so spank Meyer is a guy who's a perfect example of this you don't know if his films or cartoons or what he uses claymation he uses stop action humans he used live-action humans he in his film Faust which is incredibly uses puppets life-sized puppets many puppets everything to tell this story and he's just been relentless in this path developing it not everything do I like but who cares and that I actually got this term the person's persistence of vision because when I was living in New Mexico I was at the Taos Film Festival and they have a persistence of vision award and they gave it to Swank Meyer of the year I was there and he you know he exemplifies that better than anyone I know so if you persist hopefully the world will embrace you but you know what if they don't who gives a  right [Applause] okay original voice I'm I I think I'm fairly well resisted being esoteric here I'm just gonna zip by this why is that original voice do we think of as first I have no answer for you you ponder that okay why do that why go this way why do this path there's a lot easier paths the challenges are crazy actually and they're great but there are challenges these are a few and one of the things that I get with my coaching clients is after six months or 12 months were work they were still working on idea like man is this is this how long it takes I might there's something wrong with me am I going too slow you know it's like I feel like I've just been working myself down into a hole and I was like yeah that's what it's like that's what it's like and they're like well it must get better I was like no it doesn't get any better actually the more you go the more uncomfortable it gets and and not just not just the financial uncertainty really I mean that's whatever but just this the sense of do I am I on the right path do I know what I'm doing what I made back then was cool and I don't know about this so so there we go are there rewards you bet there's rewards look at them [Applause] okay on to the real rewards I think the most important thing is that you get to do what only you do as opposed to trying to ape somebody else's path you know how can you beat that it sucks if nobody calls you for that well then you just make your own but you know if you persist you get you get called for what you can do and it is true that if you work towards your own authenticity you have a longer path otherwise you're just jumping John Ross and and why in my view why do something that someone else has done probably there's people out there who do it better than you unless you're the freakin best light jazz saxophone player in the world I don't know no derogatory to all you jazz saxophone players there but just an easy pick so I like jazz too so that's it guys so found it again no need to pit yourselves that was real you've all earned your BFA and thank you for tray guns so much for doing that do you guys want to hear another performance were your oyster [Music]
