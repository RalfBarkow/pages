        "text": "As we come to recognise the complexity of the systems that we are, that we live within and that we are creating, the \"Law of Unintended Consequences\" comes in to play. This law holds that almost all human actions have at least one unintended consequence. If we want different results from a situation we need to change the underlying system structure and relationships that are creating or causing the situation to exist, and in so doing create different results or outcomes."
