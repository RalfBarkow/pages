Communication systems  must understand communicating itself as an action, and only in this sense does the action become a necessary part of the system's self-reproduction from moment to moment. It is therefore never wrong, but one-sided [\"one way\"], for a communication system to conceive of itself as a system of action. It is only through [[Action]] that communication becomes fixed as a simple [[Event]] at a point in [[Time]]."
