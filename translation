Again, sociology of science has provided some analytic tools. In the classic cases described by Callan and Latour, the symbolic systems of different groups are translated into a coherent and monolithic representational regime (Callan, 1986; Latour, 1987). Graphically, one can see a funnel shape with information channeled into a spokesperson. Members' concerns are re-represented (Star, 1995b) under a single rubric, and people learn to see (or are forced to see) their concerns in a second language. Models are typical translation structures in the sense that they are used by system designers to re-represent the diversity of individual symbolic systems. Translation struggles are often found in attempts to standardize systems components."
