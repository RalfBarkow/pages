Here he speaks of an experience of seeing a Allen Newell struggle with a programming challenge during his days at PARC:\n>Watching a famous guy much smarter than I struggle for more than 30 minutes to not quite solve the problem his way (there was a bug) made quite an impression.  It brought home to me once again that \"point of view is worth 80 IQ points.\"  I wasn't smarter but I had a much better internal thinking tool to amplify my abilities.  This incident and others like it made paramount that any tool for children should have great thinking patterns and deep beauty \"built-in.\" [http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/ source]\t\t"
