This noise is essential for emergence, because when structure emerges, it emerges from a sea of noise (what else?).  The critical questions do not include \"can an architecture emerge\".  An architecture \"can\" always emerge, given the right conditions.  The real questions have to do with the minimal conditions under which structure will emerge from apparent noise.

This is not to say the world isn't full of idiots. The point is, all reliable designs emerge from a process of evaluating ideas, mitigating risks, and answering the unknowns. This process is called research & development (R&D). It's the phase that preceeds production and helps to ward off any big gotchas. Both XP and BDUF have an R&D phase.

I think a better way to frame it would be that good architectures evolve (through careful attention to points of elegant simplicity in the design space) and that architectures tend to converge as in biological systems, i.e. given the same environmental constraints for organisms evolving through many different pathways, you tend to get a similar result. This evolution and convergent was one of the goals of the early SCRUM process. Extreme Programming has, as a principle, careful attention to points of elegant simplicity in the design space, so XP may make the case that constraints implicit in the XP process tend to evolve good architecture. In this sense, XP architecture is emergent through constrained evolution, a concept that the naive reader will certainly miss on first reading. -- [[Jeff Sutherland]]",
