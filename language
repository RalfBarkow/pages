They know individual learning. They also know signal exchange, by which they mutually influence selections. These performances are combined and uniquely enhanced by language. This happens by linking meaning with communicable signs and thus shifting it into the communication process itself. Not only the perceptual data themselves have their immediate sense of reality, but in addition special, namely perceptual data producible for communication purposes - although also perceptual data! - gain a special meaning which is superimposed on the perceptual world and represents it. The sign function is not thereby first constituted - a buffalo can very well be a sign for the fact that more buffaloes are present; but it is generalized and made communicatively practicable also for situations in which neither the thing nor its natural signs occur. The word \"buffalo\" need not stand next to the buffalo as another […]"
