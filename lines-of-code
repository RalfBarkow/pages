Bad code or code that is skewed by making LOC a performance metric, or atypical code generation or particularities that force time into reducing LOC, etc will all have an effect. Like everything else in programming, there is some art and judgment needed in the use of LOC. On balance, though, on my own projects it has been a terrific measure to use, I use it frequently and it has generally not been a disappointment. It has given me the information I needed. Programmer productivity is traditionally about 20 lines of production code a day. When you look at your output over the years, you will see that even though you can crank out 1/2/3 hundred lines in a day, the larger that code body is the more likely you are to revisit it prior to or during production. My productivity has been higher than 20 over the years, but not that much and my days have been long and I have been a rather prolific writer. Still, in a quarter century of programming I have not likely delivered much more than 500K lines of code, tops, to final production. Off the top of my head, there are only about 150K that I can account for that resides on my systems here. I know from a long difficult run at it, when I was near the top of my game, I produced just a little over 1K lines a month through to final production over a period of about 14 months (about 16K lines). That was proper, solid code that saw about 3,000 man years of production without requiring a fix. Those were long months, though and I got some leverage from working on the same system on top of my own code from the ground up over that time (the actual product was about 35K lines of my code, but close to 20K was library code written over the years). In ordinary situations, I don't think that 20 LOC/day is far off the mark. As it goes up from there, it starts to accumulate bugs from what I have seen. Note that this can fluctuate wildly over the short term. Some days you see zero lines or even negative lines as you debug and scrap bad code, some days you see 150 lines of 'easy code' and I have produced as much as 300 lines of (not very good) code in a day.

However, if you have programmers that are deliberately basing their coding decisions on upping (or lowering) their line count, you have bigger problems anyway. Empirically, it is a nice fast measure that *does* mean something. Like everything else, you use it for what it does well and move on. ",

In some instances, if the code is generated as a result of building a GUI (and it simply is the code manifestation of the work done in the GUI builder), then that also should be counted. I generally count generated code like that because it has empirically proven to be roughly equivalent in terms of time, effort, complexity, etc. ",

That *does* include generated code, but again only if that code is a reflection of work by a programmer at tool level. I am thinking of GUI builders and the code they generate combined with the code done by hand. It has (again, YMMV) been an equivalent measure in terms of work-effort, likelihood of errors, system complexity, etc to any other coding. Note that this is either my own code or teams that I work with. In that case, certain standards of care are applied such that white space is generally uniform in its use (an empty line between variable declarations and code, an empty line between functions, simple headers for main functions, no headers for small [[Helper Function]]s, one statement per line, lots of narrow scoping, small functions, etc). AFAIK, it is still true that LOC is a good measure of time and effort across languages. ",

Bad code or code that is skewed by making LOC a performance metric, or atypical code generation or particularities that force time into reducing LOC, etc will all have an effect. Like everything else in programming, there is some art and judgment needed in the use of LOC. On balance, though, on my own projects it has been a terrific measure to use, I use it frequently and it has generally not been a disappointment. It has given me the information I needed. Programmer productivity is traditionally about 20 lines of production code a day. When you look at your output over the years, you will see that even though you can crank out 1/2/3 hundred lines in a day, the larger that code body is the more likely you are to revisit it prior to or during production. My productivity has been higher than 20 over the years, but not that much and my days have been long and I have been a rather prolific writer. Still, in a quarter century of programming I have not likely delivered much more than 500K lines of code, tops, to final production. Off the top of my head, there are only about 150K that I can account for that resides on my systems here. I know from a long difficult run at it, when I was near the top of my game, I produced just a little over 1K lines a month through to final production over a period of about 14 months (about 16K lines). That was proper, solid code that saw about 3,000 man years of production without requiring a fix. Those were long months, though and I got some leverage from working on the same system on top of my own code from the ground up over that time (the actual product was about 35K lines of my code, but close to 20K was library code written over the years). In ordinary situations, I don't think that 20 LOC/day is far off the mark. As it goes up from there, it starts to accumulate bugs from what I have seen. Note that this can fluctuate wildly over the short term. Some days you see zero lines or even negative lines as you debug and scrap bad code, some days you see 150 lines of 'easy code' and I have produced as much as 300 lines of (not very good) code in a day.
