Die lateinische Herkunft legt es zunächst nahe, an einen Text zu denken, der eine Reihe von Direktiven zusammenstellt. Besonders in den romanischen Sprachen ist diese Assoziation fast unvermeidlich. Linguisten haben diesen Wortgebrauch abstrahiert, den Direktionswert abschwächend. Dann bezeichnet der Begriff einen nichtbeliebigen, in sich abgestimmten, Widersprüche aber nicht ausschließenden Zusammenhang von Symbolen1. Auf diese Weise ist ein theoretisch nahezu unbrauchbarer Begriff entstanden, der kein Abgrenzungskriterium enthält, es also nicht erlaubt, festzustellen, welche Direktiven oder Symbole zu einem Code gehören und welche nicht. Man muß demnach eine besondere Kultur, eine Tradition, eine regionale Eigenart usw. schon kennen, um intuitiv darüber entscheiden zu können, was zum Code dieses Ausschnitts gehört und was nicht.\n"
