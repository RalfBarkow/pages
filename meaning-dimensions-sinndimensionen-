In the case of social systems, the difference concerns the topic of communication; in the case of psychic systems, it refers to objects of conscious attention. For every topic and every object, the fact dimension expresses a difference between two horizons: the internal and the external of what is indicated by observation. The observer can indicate one side of the distinction and negate the other, whilst still keeping it available for further indications. In the fact dimension, we can select a system reference, for instance through the paradigmatic distinction system/environment. Thus the observer orients herself to a system and leaves everything else in the background as the environment of that system. The identity of the observed system is in this case the internal—to which the observation refers—and everything else constitutes the external of this form. In general, concerning the topic selected by the communication or the object that the consciousness is made aware of, we are dealing here with the reduction of environmental →[[complexity]], which allows the finding of connections for further operations in the observing system. Complexity, for its part, is maintained in the form of other topics or other possible objects, i.e., as “something else” in relation to the topic or the intended object."

The social dimension is based on the non-identity of both communication partners and treats this non-identity as the doubled reference horizon. Of relevance here is not simply the fact that ego indicates alter’s internal horizon as a system observed in the fact dimension; rather it is of greater import that alter is also an observer operating contingently and unpredictably. Ego and alter observe one other reciprocally, and this reciprocal dependence of each on the other constitutes the social character of the difference ego/alter."

The possibility of grasping the passing of time is based on a particularly complex construction in the temporal dimension. This possibility requires two different ways of determining the present, which are only possible simultaneously. On the one hand, the present always occurs as an event—i.e., at a certain point in time—and indicates the moment in which changes become irreversible. On the other hand, this eventfulness can only be observed on the basis of a present that has duration and guarantees the possibility of reversibility. In the punctualized present, the future constantly becomes the past: this is the time measured by a clock and which passes continuously. The durative present, which holds access to the possible open, despite the irreversibility of events, is the present in which the beginning and end of periods can be determined, processes can be accelerated or decelerated, and permanent situations can be observed. The permanence of a situation is the background in front of which the irreversibility of events can be observed, whilst the punctuality of events makes it possible to observe a permanent situation. Only the distinction be- tween punctuality and permanence allows the projection of a future and a past, since it would be impossible to construct a memory of past selections, or to project a time that has yet to occur, on the basis of simple irreversibility (or permanence). Thanks to the simultaneity of both presents, it is possible to distinguish →[[structures]] and →[[processes]], depending on whether the duration of a temporal situation or the sequence of momentary events that occur in that situation is taken into account."

These three dimensions are differentiated in that the concrete actualization in one meaning-dimension does not determine what can be actualized in the others. The duration of an object (temporal dimension) is not determined by consensus (social dimension) about its existence, just as the choice of a period of time (temporal dimension) determines neither what can be observed (fact dimension), nor who will do the observing (social dimen- sion).\n"

Conversely, constituting what can be observed demands their interdependence, because what is actualized in one dimension limits (not determines) the possibility of determining meaning in the others. When, for instance, the perspectives on the future in a given situation change, consequences can arise both for the possibilities of consensus or dissent, and for the factual spectrum of the things that can be realized in the present.

The possibility of grasping the passing of time is based on a particularly complex construction in the temporal dimension. This possibility requires two different ways of determining the present, which are only possible simultaneously. On the one hand, the present always occurs as an event—i.e., at a certain point in time—and indicates the moment in which changes become irreversible. On the other hand, this eventfulness can only be observed on the basis of a present that has duration and guarantees the possibility of reversibility. In the punctualized present, the future constantly becomes the past: this is the time measured by a clock and which passes continuously. The durative present, which holds access to the possible open, despite the irreversibility of events, is the present in which the beginning and end of periods can be determined,"

The durative present, which holds access to the possible open, despite the irreversibility of events, is the present in which the beginning and end of periods can be determined, processes can be accelerated or decelerated, and permanent situations can be observed. The permanence of a situation is the background in front of which the irreversibility of events can be observed, whilst the punctuality of events makes it possible to observe a permanent situation. Only the distinction be- tween punctuality and permanence allows the projection of a future and a past, since it would be impossible to construct a memory of past selections, or to project a time that has yet to occur, on the basis of simple irreversibility (or permanence). Thanks to the simultaneity of both presents, it is possible to distinguish →[[structures]] and →[[processes]], depending on whether the duration of a temporal situation or the sequence of momentary events that occur in that situation is taken into account."
