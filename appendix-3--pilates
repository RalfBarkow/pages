Pilates teaches ideal body alignment and symmetry, and enables the rider to develop the suppleness and specific strength in the spine and pelvis to absorb the equine pelvic movements and work with the equine movement, rather than against it. Developing a “dynamic riding seat” enables enhanced upper body function, and most importantly, active release of unnecessary tension and tightness in inappropriate muscle groups. A true, independent seat is established.",

The essence of Pilates is that the bad habits or faulty movement patterns must first be unlearnt, and then the correct movements and muscle sequences learnt and repeated over and over until they become natural. The basic principles such as corrected standing and sitting postures, and breathing techniques, can and must be practised at any time if the bad habits are to be changed. Changing repetitive asymmetrical activities such as shovelling and carrying heavy buckets should be practised equally with both sides or with both arms. Pilates principles are best practised little and often in a variety of positions whilst riding. Most importantly it should be practiced during activities of daily life.",

Features such as short stocky legs, or a top heavy upper body can be a mechanical disadvantage, but on the other hand a well constructed rider may lack the rider performance and therefore restrict the abilities of the horse. Our body shape is on the whole difficult to change radically, although weight loss has a huge implication for balance and mobility.  Of greater importance possibly, is the combined choice of the rider and horse team.  It would seem more appropriate for example, to select a mount with a suitable riding action for a very short stout rider.",

Cardio vascular fitness is important in maintaining suppleness, strength and general health and should be considered an essential part of rider training. This does not mean that every rider should employ a personal trainer and attend the gym 3 times a week. Simple cardio vascular activities include walking further and quicker over regular routes, climbing stairs, running on the spot for 1 minute bursts, and are easy and convenient to perform regularly at no added expense. It is advisable that we each should attempt to get slightly out of breath at least once a day. Riders do need to consider the sports and activities that they practise. Try to select symmetrical activities such as swimming rather than tennis and squash which reinforce asymmetrical muscle function.",

Indeed, if the rider is correctly balanced, and has developed a true, independent seat, then riding can act positively upon the spinal joints.  Most adults will experience an episode of back pain at some point in their life, and back pain is the most common reason for a GP visit. It may be the activities of stable management and the additional strain on the lower back that is more responsible for the high incidence of back pain. Disc related back pain is also more common in the younger and middle aged adult.  Back pain must be treated and managed well to avoid the onset of a chronic problem. Individuals must also be more responsible for managing their own symptoms long term, and not rely so much on the medical approach for a quick fix for their problems. The Pilates principles of strengthening the core musculature and re-educating movement patterns play a huge part in maintaining a healthier spine.",

It is almost possible to consider Pilates as dressage training for the rider. One of the most obvious benefits of dressage training for the horse is the enhanced awareness and sensitivity to the aids that you instil. Only with this increase in proprioception will you and the horse be able to progress on to more challenging moves and better dressage scores.",

Features such as short stocky legs, or a top heavy upper body can be a mechanical disadvantage, but on the other hand a well constructed rider may lack the rider performance and therefore restrict the abilities of the horse. Our body shape is on the whole difficult to change radically, although weight loss has a huge implication for balance and mobility.  Of greater importance possibly, is the combined choice of the rider and horse team.  It would seem more appropriate for example, to select a mount with a suitable riding action for a very short stout rider.",

Cardio vascular fitness is important in maintaining suppleness, strength and general health and should be considered an essential part of rider training. This does not mean that every rider should employ a personal trainer and attend the gym 3 times a week. Simple cardio vascular activities include walking further and quicker over regular routes, climbing stairs, running on the spot for 1 minute bursts, and are easy and convenient to perform regularly at no added expense. It is advisable that we each should attempt to get slightly out of breath at least once a day. Riders do need to consider the sports and activities that they practise. Try to select symmetrical activities such as swimming rather than tennis and squash which reinforce asymmetrical muscle function.",

Indeed, if the rider is correctly balanced, and has developed a true, independent seat, then riding can act positively upon the spinal joints.  Most adults will experience an episode of back pain at some point in their life, and back pain is the most common reason for a GP visit. It may be the activities of stable management and the additional strain on the lower back that is more responsible for the high incidence of back pain. Disc related back pain is also more common in the younger and middle aged adult.  Back pain must be treated and managed well to avoid the onset of a chronic problem. Individuals must also be more responsible for managing their own symptoms long term, and not rely so much on the medical approach for a quick fix for their problems. The Pilates principles of strengthening the core musculature and re-educating movement patterns play a huge part in maintaining a healthier spine.",

My only reservation from a Pilates aspect is the availability in the UK of the machine based Pilates exercises highlighted in the book.
