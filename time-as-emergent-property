I summarize here this point of view, explaining why I think that in a fundamental description of nature we must \"forget time\", and how this can be done in the classical and in the quantum theory. The idea is to develop a formalism that treats dependent and independent variables on the same footing. In short, I propose to interpret mechanics as a theory of [[relations]] between variables, rather than the theory of the evolution of variables in time. "

Does this imply that in the past the world was in a non-generic microstate? I point out an alternative. The subsystem to which we belong interacts with the universe via a relatively small number of quantities, which define a coarse graining. [[Entropy]] happens to depends on coarse-graining. Therefore the entropy we ascribe to the universe depends on the peculiar coupling between us and the rest of the universe. Low past entropy may be due to the fact that this coupling (rather than microstate of the universe) is non-generic. I argue that for any generic microstate of a sufficiently rich system there are always special subsystems defining a coarse graining for which the entropy of the rest is low in one time direction (the \"past\"). These are the subsystems allowing creatures that \"live in time\" ---such as those in the biosphere--- to exist. I reply to some objections raised to an earlier presentation of this idea, in particular by Bob Wald, David Albert and Jim Hartle. "

Only in the second law \nof thermodynamics does the march from order to disorder appear in sequence. But order itself is a perceptual notion that is not consistent between observers. So, likely, we have socially constructed the illusive notion of time just as we have constructed the notion of consciousness. "
