Whilst some countries integrated this protection in their existing legal regulations against unfair competition – which thereby became a sort of “market law” – other countries continued to provide protection for competitors under tort law, and supplemented this by provisions on specific business practices, serving mainly consumers’ interests."

      "text": "The 1996 WIPO Model Provisions (WMP) seek to implement Art. 10bis of the Paris Convention. On the one hand, they define the principal acts or practices against which protection is to be granted, namely the causing of confusion with respect to another’s enterprise or its activities (Art. 2), the damaging of another’s goodwill or reputation (Art. 3), the misleading of the public (Art. 4), the discrediting of another’s enterprise or its activities (Art. 5) and, finally, unfair competition in respect of secret information (Art. 6). On the other hand, they provide for a general clause (Art. 1 Para.1) which is intended to serve as a basis for protection against any other acts of unfair competition. The system of the Model Provisions thus follows Art. 10bis. A general provision (Art. 10bis Para. 2 PC and Art. 1 Para. 1 WMP) is supplemented by the identification of certain acts which, in particular, must be prohibited (Art. 10bis Para. 3 and Arts. 2 to 6 WMP). The higher number of expressly listed acts of unfair competition in the Model Provisions can be seen as an indication of the objective to further concretise individual instances in which to provide protection. Before revisiting the catalogue of forbidden acts, however, some horizontal conceptual considerations are addressed."

The additional example suggests taking into account the interests of both competitors and consumers (see subsection 2.2.). In this vein, the 1994 WIPO study identifies as a common aspect of the examples in Art. 10bis Para. 3 “the attempt (by an entrepreneur) to succeed in competition without relying on his own achievements in terms of quality and price of his products and services, but rather by taking undue advantage of the work of another or by influencing consumer demand with false or misleading statements”. As to the purpose of protection, it states that “unfair competition law was initially designed to protect the honest businessman”, and clarifies that, in the meantime, “consumer protection has been recognised as equally important”."

      "text": "[…] The issue of misleading the public, constituting the third example of Art. 10bis Para. 3, is addressed in Art. 4 WMP. Again, a broad approach is taken. The notes on the provision clarify that, besides inherently false indications, literally correct statements as well as the omission of information are to be prohibited if they give a misleading impression. Obvious exaggerations in the course of “sales talk”, by contrast, need not necessarily be qualified as misleading. Like in Art. 5 WMP, the examples of the second paragraph refer to advertising and promotion activities. The list of characteristics of products or services contains additionally a reference to the geographical origin. Art. 4 WMP, however, is silent on how to determine the impression on the addressee of a misleading statement. In this respect, the 1994 WIPO study points out that the Paris Convention left this question to Member States, and provides an overview of different approaches, such as a distinction between average and gullible consumers, and the determination of a misleading effect on the basis of empirical data or through an overall estimation by the judge."

Considering the questions left open in the Paris Convention, as identified in subsection 2.2., it can be concluded that they demonstrate the adaptability of international unfair competition law to actual problems and needs. The inclusion of consumer protection, the departure from the requirement of a competitive relationship, the broad approach to confusing, discrediting and misleading acts and, finally, express mention of further cases of unfair competition, concerning dilution and trade secrets, testify to the aim of updating the traditional unfair competition principle of honest practices."

There was therefore a need for a balancing of interests. The ECJ held that it was itself able to determine whether the German prohibition of this designation for the marketing of cosmetics could be justified by the objective of consumer protection or of human health. Because the company range of cosmetic products was marketed in Germany exclusively by perfume shops and the cosmetics departments of department stores, hence none of the products being available in pharmacies, and because the products were presented as cosmetics and not as pharmaceuticals, and finally because the products were lawfully sold in other Member States under the name “Clinique”, apparently without consumers being mislead by the use of this name, the ECJ did not regard a prohibition of the use of the name “Clinique as necessary in order to achieve the objective of consumer protection or consumer health. The clinical or medical connotation of the term was not sufficient to ascribe a misleading effect to the name that might justify its prohibition for the products sold under the said conditions."

This case concerned the use of the adjective “naturrein” (naturally pure) for jam that was to a significant extent contaminated with the usual pollutants. The ECJ, in formal terms, maintained the position it had adopted in the 6-Korn case. It was a matter for the national courts to determine whether a designation, a trademark or advertising could be misleading. However, in contrast to the 6-Korn decision, the ECJ believed that it had sufficient indications to be able to make findings about the pollutants contained in the jam."

This consensus was possible in particular with respect to advertising, and yet a draft Directive on misleading and unfair advertising published in 1979 failed because the British considered the concept of unfairness to be too vague. Directive 84/450/EEC adopted in 1984 was thus limited to misleading advertising, with unfair advertising left for “later” regulation. However, this never happened, and instead the Directive was extended in 1997 through the inclusion of comparative advertising while a number of media and product-specific Directives were adopted that also applied to advertising. Only in 2005, a Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices with a broader approach was adopted; it is, however, restricted to “B2C”-relationships as Prof. Schuhmacher will later explain in detail."

The inclusion of consumer protection, the departure from the requirement of a competitive relationship, the broad approach to confusing, discrediting and misleading acts and, finally, express mention of further cases of unfair competition, concerning dilution and trade secrets, testify to the aim of updating the traditional unfair competition principle of honest practices."

There was therefore a need for a balancing of interests. The ECJ held that it was itself able to determine whether the German prohibition of this designation for the marketing of cosmetics could be justified by the objective of consumer protection or of human health. Because the company range of cosmetic products was marketed in Germany exclusively by perfume shops and the cosmetics departments of department stores, hence none of the products being available in pharmacies, and because the products were presented as cosmetics and not as pharmaceuticals, and finally because the products were lawfully sold in other Member States under the name “Clinique”, apparently without consumers being mislead by the use of this name, the ECJ did not regard a prohibition of the use of the name “Clinique as necessary in order to achieve the objective of consumer protection or consumer health. The clinical or medical connotation of the term was not sufficient to ascribe a misleading effect to the name that might justify its prohibition for the products sold under the said conditions."

This case concerned the use of the adjective “naturrein” (naturally pure) for jam that was to a significant extent contaminated with the usual pollutants. The ECJ, in formal terms, maintained the position it had adopted in the 6-Korn case. It was a matter for the national courts to determine whether a designation, a trademark or advertising could be misleading. However, in contrast to the 6-Korn decision, the ECJ believed that it had sufficient indications to be able to make findings about the pollutants contained in the jam."
