Your mention of \"its public interface\" prompts recall of the \"built-in\" AoP provided by .NET by means of attributes/interfaces. That actually raises the distinction between \"black-box\" and \"clear-box\" AoP; equating AoP with only the former perhaps tempts one to question the added-value of AoP over OOP.

Thus a Bat and a Bird can both have a fly method with the same implementation without forcing all mammals to have a fly method.\nMixins may also applied to specific objects as well. This results in elegant code reuse that is not elegant in OO languages. If AOP has any value, it should be a way to reduce complexity overall and reuse code. --[[Ben Thomasson]]",

Inheritance and generics being the most primitive forms of class metaprogramming - templates being slightly more sophisiticated, but being limited by their inability to handle the members of it's class arguments as collections of the argument class' features. Mixins are similarly limited, being a subclass of templates.

Generic, likewise, can be explained in terms of OOP - designing functionality based on the abilities of a type rather than specifically what type or interface it is, yet maintaining knowledge of what type it is to ensure type-safety.

While the nature of Aspects is as ill-defined as the nature of Objects, the nature of Aspects is also as <i>well</i>-defined as the nature of objects. The two concepts have equal power and are of an orthogonal and somewhat dualistic nature. Object-oriented code describes behavior and structure within objects, plus the signals between them. Aspect-oriented programming takes the opposite approach and operates directly upon the medium carrying the objects and propogating the signals between them. The logging example is simply a traditional example of its use. Aspect-Oriented does not involve class metaprogramming by necessity; it could work equally well in a language without classes.

If OOP was a success, AOP let a lot of people a bit puzzled. It is as if a lot of us were feeling something was going on there, something intellectually interesting but something that is still not worth using :-) Indeed, I never needed AOP to solve a problem that could not be solved by standard design patterns.
