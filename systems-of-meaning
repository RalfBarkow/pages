This means first of all that we focus only on social and mental systems, which we take to be separate systems. Social systems are not composed of people, nor of consciousnesses, nor of anything else that could be called mental; conversely, the elementary unit of social systems (communication) does not find its way into the mental system.

Social systems are not domains in which people talking to each other dwell. And the psyche? – It does not squat behind the forehead and look out through the eyes ... Eyes, dear little windows ... do you know this evening song by Gottfried Keller?"

In the circle is the system, the circle line is the boundary, around it is the environment, in which then other circles appear, other systems with their surrounding worlds."
