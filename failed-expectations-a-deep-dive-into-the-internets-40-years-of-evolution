      "text": "In a recent workshop, I attended, reflecting on the evolution of the Internet over the past 40 years, one of the takeaways for me is how we창ve managed to surprise ourselves in both the unanticipated successes we창ve encountered and in the instances of failure when technology has stubbornly resisted to be deployed despite our confident expectations to the contrary! What have we learned from these lessons about our inability to predict technology outcomes?  Are the issues related to the aspects of the technology? Are they embedded in the considerations behind the expectations about how a technology will be adopted? Or do the primary issues reside at a deeper level relating to economic and even political contexts? Let's look at this question of failed expectations using several specific examples drawn from the last 40 years of the Internet's evolution."
