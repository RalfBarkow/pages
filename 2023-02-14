        "text": "In mid-January, an explosive device detonated in the northern Albanian city of Shkodra, causing considerable property damage in front of the house of the head of the criminal investigation department. When investigators tried to analyze footage from security cameras near the scene, they discovered they had no access to data. Since then, a police operation has been underway across the country to seize illegally installed surveillance cameras. By early February, nearly 500 security cameras had been dismantled in Albanian cities such as Shkodra, Tirana, Vlora and Durrës."

        "text": "For police officers, there is no doubt about who has placed the devices on utility poles and over street canyons: They are criminal gangs and drug gangs that not only keep tabs on the security forces but also monitor rivals. Influential drug lords operate in port cities like Durrës and Vlora, cultivating close ties with the Italian mafia on the other side of the Adriatic. A criminal police officer from Shkodra told the Balkan Insight research network that the cameras have been used by criminals to tail assassins who have killed dozens of people in recent years.\n"
