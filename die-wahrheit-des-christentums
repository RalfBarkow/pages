The vast majority, however, wanted nothing more than to follow in the footsteps of the old prophets and renew the binding nature of the old laws.

Rather, Jesus' claim to be the Son of God meets a situation in which he promises to overcome a crisis in which people want to rediscover their general coherence, a unity and truth that allows them to come to terms with their fear; a fear that has been inherent in them since they left tribal societies, and which in the Old Testament is indissolubly linked to the concept of original sin: the fear of having to recognize that a unity other than the one their mortal body offers them does not in fact exist. With Jesus, conceived as the Son of God, they were able to place themselves in a unity that promised redemption to their torments of soul."

I can only appeal to evidence here, as I have basically always done when addressing particular historical situations: For, of course, I do not intend here to present history as an outgrowth of certain mental operations. In fact, of course, it always behaves the other way around: certain mental reflections on truth offer themselves precisely because the historical situation suggests them. Just as the genesis of money made Greek philosophy possible. But because of this, thinking itself can nevertheless not be understood as a mere reflex of the real conditions. Reality, in order to be able to be real at all, must be connected with a thinking which makes this reality possible in the first place."

      "text": "What sounds very stilted here describes a problem that modern positivism simply does not have: It assumes, logically this is completely correct, that what is shown empirically must also have been possible. If, however, one asks the question about this possibility historically, which means that one asks how, starting from a given historical situation, that could come into being which currently exists and is held to be true, every positivism fails - and this is even more true for that of Foucault and all other Heideggerians. There is simply no reality in the Roman Empire from which it could be explained why its last chance to survive was to ennoble Christianity to the state religion. (We know this only from today's perspective.) No historical facts exist from which it could be conclusively proven why the Jews invented monotheism. Likewise, there are no historically verifiable events from which the emergence of capitalism could be explained positivistically. All these facts show only one thing: If no logic in thinking (and only there is logic) is assumed to them, which made the future development possible in the first place, then history, as it has taken place, should not have taken place at all."

Only when logic is read in terms of content, as the philosopher of religion [[Klaus Heinrich]] has made clear, can the connection, the synthesis, i.e. the truth of the interrelatedness of logic and history (being and becoming) be represented. For this purpose, I thus fall back on the coping with fear, better perhaps coping with panic of the respective individual human being. The attempts to overcome the crisis expressed in it are for me the central motive of the people to direct their behavior towards a divine general. I would like to leave this statement in its evidence at this point simply as self-evident, knowing well that this evidence is highly problematic and would have to be discussed actually more exactly."

And exactly in the way as described above, namely that the monstrosity of the assertion, Jesus was God's son, sets a logic in motion, in which the meaningfulness of the second look takes away the first its absurdity. It was clear to the first disciples of Jesus that after his execution they had to prove that he was immortal: otherwise he would not be God after all. And so he appeared to them and to some others even after his death. Thus they followed a logic, of which even their master probably had not even a clue. And then Paul came. He recognized the social potential of this claim and adapted the teachings of this Jesus so congenially to the reality of the Roman Empire that modern Protestantism, too, in its effort to give capital the religion it deserves, only had to follow his lead. An awareness of which logic he followed in this adaptation was needed by Paul as little as by Protestantism, and as little as by the state religion of the Eastern Roman, i.e. Byzantine empire, and as little as by Islam: their endeavor was to become state religion, and thus to regenerate an obedience to the empire in question, which welded its members into a unity that made military coercion within it as superfluous as possible."

Christianity inevitably had to break this reference to the unity as a people, because the people of the Jews found this way of appearance as Messiah, claimed by Jesus, all too harebrained to follow him: and so Christianity was in a certain sense universal from the outset, referring to all people as far as they lived in the Roman Empire - and as long as this person was only not a Jew."

It refers to a synthesis that transcends being and becoming itself by turning to concepts and their structure. But in this 'simple', secular way God must not be understood, because this would mean that God would be absolutely separated from God the Father and God the Son, just as Father and Son are then. In order to heal this, the Holy Spirit intervened. God, that is the One, which is differentiated in itself in Father and Son, whose mediation in the spirit is the One, which carries the name God."

With Jesus, conceived as the Son of God, they were able to place themselves in a unity that promised redemption to their torments of soul."

I can only appeal to evidence here, as I have basically always done when addressing particular historical situations: For, of course, I do not intend here to present history as an outgrowth of certain mental operations. In fact, of course, it always behaves the other way around: certain mental reflections on truth offer themselves precisely because the historical situation suggests them. Just as the genesis of money made Greek philosophy possible. But because of this, thinking itself can nevertheless not be understood as a mere reflex of the real conditions. Reality, in order to be able to be real at all, must be connected with a thinking which makes this reality possible in the first place."

If, however, one asks the question about this possibility historically, which means that one asks how, starting from a given historical situation, that could come into being which currently exists and is held to be true, every positivism fails - and this is even more true for that of Foucault and all other Heideggerians. There is simply no reality in the Roman Empire from which it could be explained why its last chance to survive was to ennoble Christianity to the state religion. (We know this only from today's perspective.) No historical facts exist from which it could be conclusively proven why the Jews invented monotheism. Likewise, there are no historically verifiable events from which the emergence of capitalism could be explained positivistically. All these facts show only one thing: If no logic in thinking (and only there is logic) is assumed to them, which made the future development possible in the first place, then history, as it has taken place, should not have taken place at all."

And exactly in the way as described above, namely that the monstrosity of the assertion, Jesus was God's son, sets a logic in motion, in which the meaningfulness of the second look takes away the first its absurdity. It was clear to the first disciples of Jesus that after his execution they had to prove that he was immortal: otherwise he would not be God after all. And so he appeared to them and to some others even after his death. Thus they followed a logic, of which even their master probably had not even a clue. And then Paul came. He recognized the social potential of this claim and adapted the teachings of this Jesus so congenially to the reality of the Roman Empire that modern Protestantism, too, in its effort to give capital the religion it deserves, only had to follow his lead. An awareness of which logic he followed in this adaptation was needed by Paul as little as by Protestantism, and as little as by the state religion of the Eastern Roman, i.e. Byzantine empire, and as little as by Islam: their endeavor was to become state religion, and thus to regenerate an obedience to the empire in question, which welded its members into a unity that made military coercion within it as superfluous as possible."
