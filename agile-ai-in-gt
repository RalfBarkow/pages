The last (using Matrices) do not yet work, I did not yet pay attention to that, but until the Iris-scripts they all work. It’s not self-explaining and I am planning to do some more visualisations (NNetwork is the next in line), because that would really make it more insightful, but in my opinion it’s usable for students without experience when someone is around that knows about Networks and Pharo/GT. \n+ Friday (so in 2 days) I will showing this to a group of students in Eindhoven as a Hands on introduction to Neural Networks. Besides giving an introduction into perceptrons, neurons & networks I will show them how to run the scripts in GT, so they hopefully will experiment with it after that. \n+ I already showed it to some colleague teachers the last months and to I think 3 or 4 students, with mixed enthusiasm. \n+ I tried PythonBridge from GT one day but had troubles getting that to work at that moment. One of the next steps could be to dive into that: then after explaining the concepts in GT it would be possbile to run Python scripts right from the same environment. \n\nI really think GT is a wonderful environment for these kind of educational material! \n\nFeedback welcome... \nRegards,\nCoen\n"
