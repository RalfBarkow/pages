According to this, forms are created by the loosely coupled, homogeneous elements of a medium being firmly (but only eventfully) coupled into forms. Medium and form are alike in that both are conceived as consisting of homogeneous elements, and they are unlike in terms of the mode of coupling: the mode of loosely coupling the elements denotes the medium, and the mode of fixed coupling denotes the form. Accordingly, forms are ephemeral but perceptible and the medium is permanent but imperceptible - and therefore must be inferred from its forms. Forms and media do not occur independently of each other, so forms are always forms in a medium, which in turn is always only medium in relation to its forms. If, for example, one takes payments as perceptible and firmly coupled (but ephemeral) forms of the economy, loosely coupled prices and quantities of money can be inferred as its elements, and thus also the imperceptible but permanent medium of success, money. Different success media such as money, truth, power or love then make different elements and forms distinguishable."

The medium generates a temporal, qualitative and quantitative modalization of the payment event through this additional shaping, so that a persistent undershooting of the threshold values can then be metaphorically described as a depression (or an economic depression). A counterpart to the mode of economic depression would then be, for example, the mode of economic overheating. The metaphor used of deceleration or trough would be indicative of a form catastrophe (Fuchs 2004: 26), namely an expression of uncertainty that the observation of economic activity is not changing, so that it is no longer (or not yet) possible to distinguish whether things are getting worse or whether they are no longer getting worse and can therefore only get better."

And this in turn is only possible if the mode of observation has already changed again. Only then does one know it came worse, and therefore the preceding episode cannot be called a depression, but must be called a recession. Or it didn't get any worse, and that's the only reason why, as soon as things get better again, the episode can be called a depression in retrospect."

This additional shaping (homogeneous/heterogeneous) would then also be a strong argument for conceptualizing technology as a modal medium (technization, technisability)."

According to this, forms are created by the loosely coupled, homogeneous elements of a medium being firmly (but only eventfully) coupled into forms. Medium and form are alike in that both are conceived as consisting of homogeneous elements, and they are unlike in terms of the mode of coupling: the mode of loosely coupling the elements denotes the medium, and the mode of fixed coupling denotes the form. Accordingly, forms are ephemeral but perceptible and the medium is permanent but imperceptible - and therefore must be inferred from its forms. Forms and media do not occur independently of each other, so forms are always forms in a medium, which in turn is always only medium in relation to its forms. If, for example, one takes payments as perceptible and firmly coupled (but ephemeral) forms of the economy, loosely coupled prices and quantities of money can be inferred as its elements, and thus also the imperceptible but permanent medium of success, money. Different success media such as money, truth, power or love then make different elements and forms distinguishable."

Only then does one know it came worse, and therefore the preceding episode cannot be called a depression, but must be called a recession. Or it didn't get any worse, and that's the only reason why, as soon as things get better again, the episode can be called a depression in retrospect."

In the case of individualization, inequality is introduced with the help of sameness and this paradox is unfolded through diversity: \"The medium of individuality (of individualizabilities) offers only one sameness - that of diversity\" (Fuchs/Fuchs n.d.: 11)."

This modal medium enables reactions when the dissimilarity of dissimilarities increases to such an extent that there is doubt about the distinctness of the dissimilar, since distinctness is only possible when aspects of sameness are available. In the case of individualization, inequality is introduced with the help of sameness and this paradox is unfolded through diversity: \"The medium of individuality (of individualizabilities) offers only one sameness - that of [[Diversity]]\" (Fuchs/Fuchs n.d.: 11)."
