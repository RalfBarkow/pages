Bayes theorem should be used any time it is appropriate. It is the equivalent of contextualizing statistics in time, place--based upon what has recently actually happened. Lots of variation is eliminated when historic particulars are taken into account. See:\n"

I think that the most efficient way to change behavior and even discover affective facts (science that affects behavior) is in conversations between people who are co-located and necessarily interactive. \n"
