A scientist would take a few research articles or monographs describing the various ingredients, and then write down their composition on a fresh sheet of paper.

Our pre-digital scientist would translate notation into concepts when reading each source, and the concepts into his or her preferred notation when writing down the composition. As long as the concepts match, as they do in any mature field "
