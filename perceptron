From (bio-)chemical point of view we may wish to know when an autocatalytic reaction with rate k can be assumed as instantaneous. In practice, we may assume that the reaction is instantaneous if its rate is such that the corresponding H-distance (between the logistic and the step function) is less than the precision of the measurement instruments used in the experiment. To achieve our goal we obtain new sharper estimates for the H-distance between a step function and its best approximating logistic function."
