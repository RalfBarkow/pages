At the beginning the garden question was asked whether one can think about how the world of a handless living being looks like. The answer was: Such a question can be asked only on the part of a living being which has a hand itself. It is indeed a zoological garden question, but it asks about the exit from the garden. It would be disingenuous not to admit that this is inherent in the question itself. Why should one ask how an actionless living being lives, if one would not have separated oneself as an acting living being from snakes and elephants from the beginning? The question was asked in order to check this anthropocentric prejudice before judgment. Thus it shows that even the projective anthropology undertaken here (man as for the time being only a possibility) is prejudiced against all living beings and condescends only to let the animal in us have its say."
