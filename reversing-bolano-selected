The body was discovered in an advanced state of decomposition. After the forensic examination, it was determined that the victim was between twenty-eight and thirty-three, five foot six, and that the cause of death was massive cerebral contusion. He wasn’t carrying identification. He was dressed in black pants, a green blouse, and tennis shoes. Car keys were found in one of his pockets. His description didn’t match that of any men missing from Santa Teresa. He had probably been dead for a few months. The case was shelved."
