        "text": "To facilitate raster manipulations, several novel computer systems have used specialized instructions dealing with the raster memory. Typically these systems have been personal computers, such as the Xerox Alto or the M.I.T. Lisp Machine, where a premium is placed on interactive graphics facilities. Their raster instructions are powerful primitives, often implemented in a combination of hardware and micro-code. Such an instruction is known as [[bitblt]] (bit boundary block transfer), or [[RasterOp]] in Newman and Sproull's terminology.\n"
