        "text": "> _\"COP21 was a failure regarding the UN side of the event. Most of the decisions came from COP15 (Copenhagen) and the 1,5 degree was a political (France) decision to make it seem like an improvement. Everyone knows it is Catch 22. The success of Paris 2015 came from the civil society and was the best thing that triggered many initiatives worldwide. \nSo I really don’t believe in the UN capacity to emerge something useful in Glasgow. Although I fully believe in the side organization to accomplish results that are urgently needed. \nI hope that COP26 will bring a strong awareness and ways to spread it.\n2022 and the meetings in Stockholm will be the most important moment for humankind to decide if there will be a game changer to reverse the pathway that, amazingly, we are still going!\" ~delegation from Brazil at COP21._ "
