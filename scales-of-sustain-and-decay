Players of other new instruments like the Steel Pan and the Theremin will certainly contest it. However, it is rare to find an academic writer who, rather than re-search or simply recycle the words and insights of others, has striven to put things together in a fresh way and connect a number of different problems creatively in a manner that prompts novel insights and fuels the curiosity of non-academic readers. Kohl’s argument ranges across fields of inquiry and the boundaries erected between disciplines with confidence and a great speed. A sequence of unlikely items flashes by. Among them are stomp boxes, alchemy and deep time. The eccentric result of their communion is both exhilarating and provocative. The social life of non- and more- or less-than-human objects has become something of a cliché in the Humanities in recent times, but this sparking contribution demonstrates that insights which proceed in that general direction need not decay into banality"

It therefore offers case studies on two of popular music's most common instruments, the electric guitar and the synthesiser, and their symbolic and material temporalities: guitar players’ quest for ‘infinite sustain’ from Santana to today's effects manufacturers and the ‘psychogeophysical’ approach by artist and theorist Martin Howse, who developed a synthesiser module using radioactive material in order to determine musical events by nuclear decay. While language uses metaphors of sustain and decay as figurative ways to express both musical and planetary dimensions, practices of music offer alternative ecologies of relating the seemingly unrelatable scales of deep time and musical time. If in the Anthropocene humankind becomes aware of its role as a geophysical force, thinking about making music in the Anthropocene requires an awareness for the temporalities involved in the materials at hand. Besides an ecological perspective, the article looks at various media (magazines, ads, and manuals) and thus positions economical mechanisms of the musical instrument manufacturing market as a small-scale experimental setting for larger-scale industrial processes.\n"
