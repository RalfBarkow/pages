In his book, Educating Ruby, Guy Claxton suggests that schools might teach lessons worth learning by focusing on developing transferrable lifelong skills, learning attitudes and beliefs, the ability to think and a creative curiosity when approaching problem-solving. He suggests that intentional focus on the nurturing of character and alongside academic understanding and skills might be the goal of the modern educator. "
