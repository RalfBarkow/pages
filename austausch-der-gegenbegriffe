One translates then an apparently identical designation into the context of another distinction, whereby it receives, often unnoticed, another sense. For example, in the 18th century one still speaks of civilitas (since the middle of the century also: civilization), but as an opposite term one no longer means barbarism, but nature."

In this way the continuity of a communication relation can be preserved with discontinuity of its meaning, and misunderstandings can be treated as understandings for a while, until one realizes by the consequences where one has been led to. This can lead to significant or questionable theoretical innovations - for example, when \"system\" is no longer taken in the sense of wholeness and distinguished from parts, but is opposed to an environment; or when \"society\" is suddenly no longer distinguished from individuals, but from state or then from community. Very irritating forms of such substitutions of distinctions occur when the designations are morally charged and then operate in an opposition of good and bad. The positive or negative charge of designations then makes it possible to signal and recognize which group the person using the designation belongs to, and the regulation of subsequent communication then takes place via a social, not a factual distinction."
