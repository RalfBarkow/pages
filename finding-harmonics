I wonder if this harmonics is a rare thing that will manifest quickly in some schools and be harder to find in others. \nPerhaps there is a way to identify the schools in which this tuning might be more easily found. Kath Murdoch’s ‘cultural markers’ of an inquiry school might provide an insight. I also wonder if the DIG, in fact, opens the possibility of a school taking an inquiry stance down the track. Might the DIG be the riff that catches attention and an inquiry stance be the rhythm  guitar that ultimately holds the tune together?\n"
