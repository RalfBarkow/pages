Rather, with analog systems, the shift happens because you’ve actually stamped the knowledge into your mind by way of neuroimprinting the knowledge on your mind. This provides you with a working memory of knowledge you can carry with you as you read more material. The name of the game isn’t about offloading thoughts [⇒ [[Offloaded Brain]]]; it’s about neuroimprinting thoughts. This feature, combined with the character limits of notecards, is a great advantage of analog systems. (p. 171–172)"

The slower pace required to use an analog Zettelkasten results in a decrease in the number of items put into the system; it simply takes longer to add the same amount of information one might add to a digital system. The same applies to the processing of the information put into each system. With the analog system, more time is required to convert the material you read into knowledge by adding your own reformulations and reflections—something not commonly undertaken in the digital versions."

Take for instance, the previously mentioned atomic design methodology which entails thinking of website components as atoms, molecules, organisms, etc. [⇐ [[Atomic Workflow]]]. Such a paradigm overcomplicates the already overcomplicated field of web development. Digital Zettelkasten workflow warriors have jumped on this bandwagon, with people synthetically trying to make their notes atomic by arbitrarily breaking them into smaller parts. However, with most digital Zettelkasten systems, there’s no actual size constraint, such as a character [[limit]], like one would find in Twitter."

        "text": "> Let me take two steps back. You want to look at risks – what risks you’re assuming and so forth. As a business you want to know where your money is coming from and where you’re spending it and scenario analysis sort of thing – what could go wrong and what could go wrong probably will go wrong – so you want to remove the possibility of things going wrong. That seems to me to be good business. When it comes to talking about a development organization, I like to take two steps closer. I like to actually sit down with people and program at the limits of our abilities together, this pairs-programming, and you can kind of see into each other’s heads and see learning strategies and test strategies and so forth. **I would ask myself the question – in that hour of programming together, how many minutes were we grappling with problems that we could [[explain]] to the customer?** And our customer would say I’m glad you were [[Grappling]] with those. I’m happy to be paying you to think through that kind of [[Decision]]. And how many minutes of that hour were spent just dealing with foolish, crazy things that just happen using the computer that if you had thought twice you could have prevented? But you didn’t think twice so you just have this nuisance level and it’s so complicated you can never explain to your customer. It isn’t about the customer’s business, it’s about your business and you’re letting your business get in the way of doing the customer’s work. That’s an intuitive ratio but I think that computers and computer programming is filled with those little nuisance things but if you could beat that back to the point where you do a significant amount of grappling with the customer’s problems every hour, then you’re in good shape. If you can do something for the customer every hour, then you’re moving forward."

The workflow of the analog system (which takes more time to consume and process less information), actually results in producing a greater quantity of output in less time, compared with digital systems. Also, the quality of the output outshines output produced by digital notetaking systems."
