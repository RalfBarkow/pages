      "text": "As seems to be self-evident for 19th century scientific culture, theory is the leading variable of the relationship. But how is this to be understood exactly? Probably not in the old sense of a hierarchy, a primacy of rank, or an essentiality primacy of theory. Theory will hardly be able to claim to be more important for man or culture or society than practice. Rather, the imbalance of the relationship between theory and practice is expressed in the fact that theory plays a role on both sides: on the side of theory and on the side of practice. On the one hand, theory performs its own service on its side of distinction, on the side of theory. In doing so, it treats practice as the object of theory under labels such as action or operation. It is therefore impossible to see why theory, as one often hears, should strive to be intelligible to practitioners. Why should it accept the limitations this implies? On the other hand, it asks, and this is quite another question, what are its implications for practice. In a sense, it doubles down, bringing itself into play as both observer and observed object. Such a maneuver, however, sabotages the classical distinction between theory and object (or between \"subject\" and \"object\"). The distinction re-enters itself. With such a \"re-entry\" the calculus explodes the scope of the classical mode of operation of cognition and becomes, if one may say so, non-computable. And the question will then be, how the further operation can still be directed with respect to objectivity or intersubjective agreement. Or: how the now indispensable \"imagination\" can still be controlled."
