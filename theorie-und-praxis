Previously, theory and practice had been distinguished separately: theory as remote knowledge of everyday knowledge and practice of poiesis, that is, of the production of works. It would now be necessary to clarify what was meant by the opposition of theory and practice. Certainly it responds to the scientific culture of the 19th century. This makes clear the meaning of theory. Theory is a working program of the scientific system. But practice?"
