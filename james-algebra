The calculus is based on a representational and computational paradigm, called [[boundary mathematics]], in which representation consists of making distinctions out of the void. The calculus uses three boundary objects to create numbers and covers complex numbers and basic transcendentals. These same objects compose into operations on these numbers. Expressions transform using three spatial match and substitute rules that work in parallel across expressions. From the calculus emerge generalized forms of cardinality and inverse that apply identically to addition and multiplication. An imaginary form in the calculus expresses numbers in phase space, creating complex numbers. The calculus attempts to represent computational constraints explicitly, thereby improving our ability to design computational machinery and mathematical interfaces. Applications of the calculus to computational and educational domains are discussed."
