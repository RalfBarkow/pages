The direction and intensity of the returned signal enables them to locate direction and distance of potential prey. In addition, they have a surprising ability to quickly differentiate between an obstacle and a prey (Fig. 2)."

Between the pulse rates, it receives feedback signals (its own signal and possibly signals from other bats swarm) by echolocation and interprets these sound waves. If the received signals have a low intensity and/or a strong rate then it is very likely that prey is detected and the bat should run toward it. Gradually, as the bats approach to the prey, its increase the amount of pulses (pulse rate) and at the same time decreases the intensity of these pulses (loudness). But if the received signals are very low levels, it continues its flight blindly, without changing the intensity of the emitted sound wave."
