All he knows about programming is what he did years ago in [[Basic Language]] on his Commodore 64, so I have to make sure to use the word \"subroutine\" a lot when I try to explain my newfangled programming ideas to him. ;-) I wrote up the code today and, on a lark, showed it to him. He said, \"I'm really thrilled about your Ruby program. It's very elegant. Elegance is important to me as a mathematician.\" I rule! I discovered a problem with that solution, though, as I explain on the [[Ruby Coerce]] page.

Have you looked at it? Best wishes -- [[John Fletcher]]",
