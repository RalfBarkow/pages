As a theoretical contribution, we find a complete characterization of the maximum variance distribution when considering the effective resistances as a distance measure between nodes. We show that this maximum variance distribution is concentrated on the boundary nodes of a graph, and provide support for this intuition by experiments on random geometric graphs and further analytical results on a number of simple graphs."
