Second, if things are defined only by their relationships, then it is like having a cloud of definitions floating in space without any reality to define its basic words. If you could define say the 1000 basic words in English by things that were very concrete and based on experience rather than definitions to other words, then in theory the rest of the words defined based on those basic words also connect to reality. I'm guessing that something similar needs to be done to connect the [[Semantic Web]]'s 'basic words' to some form of data reality. I'm also guessing that endemes can do that job. I know the connection needs to be made and I know that endemes can make the lower half of that connection. I don't have enough experience with the upper half of that connection to know how to do it, so the best I can do is make the assertion that either Endemes or some other form of [[Information Programming]] can. It seems to me that perhaps they can because users think in ways more similar to [[Endeme Contexts]] and [[Real Information]] than [[Conventional Data]], and [[Knowledge Representation]] has been designed to try to map the way users/people define and therefore think about things. I'm guessing that since the behavior of Endemes is very similar to the design goal of [[Comptuer Ontologies]] that a connection between the two should be relatively easy to build.

Second, if things are defined only by their relationships, then it is like having a cloud of definitions floating in space without any reality to define its basic words. If you could define say the 1000 basic words in English by things that were very concrete and based on experience rather than definitions to other words, then in theory the rest of the words defined based on those basic words also connect to reality. I'm guessing that something similar needs to be done to connect the [[Semantic Web]]'s 'basic words' to some form of data reality. I'm also guessing that endemes can do that job. I know the connection needs to be made and I know that endemes can make the lower half of that connection. I don't have enough experience with the upper half of that connection to know how to do it, so the best I can do is make the assertion that either Endemes or some other form of [[Information Programming]] can. It seems to me that perhaps they can because users think in ways more similar to [[Endeme Contexts]] and [[Real Information]] than [[Conventional Data]], and [[Knowledge Representation]] has been designed to try to map the way users/people define and therefore think about things. I'm guessing that since the behavior of Endemes is very similar to the design goal of [[Comptuer Ontologies]] that a connection between the two should be relatively easy to build.
