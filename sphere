We can put that fourth point anywhere we choose, except in the same plane as the first three, and we invariably divide space into two sections: that which is [[Inside]] the four-point system and that which is [[Outside]]. Unwittingly, we have created the minimum system. (Similarly, mathematics requires exactly four noncoplanar points to define a sphere.)"
