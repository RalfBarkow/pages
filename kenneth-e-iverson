Iverson by\nWalter Carlson, Chairman of the Awards Committee, at the ACM Annual\nConference in Detroit, Michigan, October 29, 1979.\nIn making its selection, the General Technical Achievement Award Committee cited Iverson for his pioneering effort in programming languages and\nmathematical notation resulting in what the computing field now knows as\n[[APL]]. Iverson's contributions to the implementation of interactive systems,\nto the educational uses of APL, and to programming language theory and\npractice were also noted.\nBorn and raised in Canada, Iverson received his doctorate in 1954 from\nHarvard University. There he served as Assistant Professor of Applied\nMathematics from 1955-1960. He then joined International Business Machines, Corp. and in 1970 was named an IBM Fellow in honor of his\ncontribution to the development of APL.\nDr. Iverson is presently with I.P. Sharp Associates in Toronto. He has\npublished numerous articles on programming languages and has written\nfour books about programming and mathematics: A Programming Language\n(1962), Elementary Functions (1966), Algebra: An Algorithmic Treatment\n(1972), and Elementary Analysis (1976)."
