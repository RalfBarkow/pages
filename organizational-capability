This other person, however, is in this first phase inevitably an also-lounger, my [[Neighbor]]. Only he can have an interest in helping me. But his interest is also unusually evident: first, he can hope that I will help him in the same situation, and second, every case in which a possessory claim achieves validity promotes its own chances. Mutual support, cooperation, thus imposes itself immediately. By helping the other, we help ourselves and the principle at the same time."

        "text": "However, the formation of such trust is further complicated by specific opportunities for manipulation on the part of the privileged. The privileged are able to constantly compete the hope of future benefits with the offer of present benefits: in the form of material rewards for services and loyalty, opportunities for relative individual advancement. (Why shouldn't I help guard deck chairs if I can use them temporarily to do so?) We know this strategy from all [[Stratified Societies]]. It does not establish the barriers to organizational capacity of the negatively privileged, but further reinforces them."

They rule not least because they are superior in this way, and because they rule they can constantly reproduce and possibly further extend this superiority. There are, of course, also countervailing processes: For example, what we call \"democratization\" today is essentially the product of an organizational capacity of the lower classes that is quite exceptional by historical standards and that emerged in the course of industrialization.

In our case it turns out that the \"additional chance\" of the superior organizational ability already arises in the status nascendi of a power formation: The new group initially possessed nothing but the instantaneous de facto disposition of a general commodity and laid claim to exclusive and permanent power of disposition: this seemingly razor-thin advantage was sufficient for the formation of a superior organizational capacity, – and thus for the beginning of a process of accumulation of power against the interests of the majority."
