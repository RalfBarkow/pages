      "text": "She was born in Switzerland in 1954 and passed away in London in nineteen 2018 this is a picture of the cover of the thesis which she published herself in her prints led editions book were publishing a venture I thought I would give her a few few words to begin the talk these are a couple of excerpts from the thesis I won't read all of it I just will read a little bit of it but in trying to speak about language I found that I had to remove distinctions successive distinctions excessive distinctions we seem to think it pointless to remove distinctions if there is perhaps a point in saying the things I say it is as the naive child protesting about the cumbersome ways grown-ups have of going about things cumbersome ways which a saint Cooper II of the child found to make such grownups blind to the simplicity of things when he drew his drawing number one it was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant I don't need to read the rest about things in constructing of the observer and his construction are won and cannot be distinguished I'll leave it at that and take you to the end of laws of form where Spencer Brown says we see now that the first distinction the mark and the observer are not only interchangeable but in the form identical this is a kind of sentence that Spencer Brown wrote which sometimes is looked at and seen as a very mystical statement but it can also be the most concrete thing that you could say about language and the observer as well and and those modalities all interact as you read laws of form again and again or think about these matters again and again next topic this is about part of the work of Varela Montano and a rebei in their well-known paper on auto polices and what they did was they took a an abstract chemical substrate a catalyst star which if it has some chemical neighbors which I'll just call circles combines to become neighbors that can be bound together and the binding can occur over time and there is decay all of these recursive constructions that I mention as I will mention many recursive constructions as we go along fit Dirk's principles very well about form and decay you can think about that in relation to this that the ones that combine decay after some time back into the ordinary ones and so what happens when you begin with a catalyst in in a soup like that is that the bindings begin to form in the neighborhood of the catalyst and naturally out of the geometry of this situation the bindings form a circle and become a boundary which creates a protocell out of the distinctions that are present so that a new distinction arises the new distinctions arise the proto cells with their boundaries out of other forms of distinction that are pressed in the substrate so this is the process of auto police's that they illustrated here and it is a very interesting and important image about how distinctions arise from distinctions in the course of recursion and in the course of this kind of construction you can make modern versions of this so in the model the elemental distinctions interact to produce a new distinction the protocell in the plane that maintains its distinctive structure in the course of the recursion of the molecular interactions of course it when you start to look at models like this you you will feel like oh well I I don't they don't want maybe to start with a whole collection of pre-processed distinctions to begin with why shouldn't all the distinctions be arising and and then you find yourself exploring further to see whether that might be the case and in any case in the making of a distinction the distinction was not there until it was made you may draw a circle in a tied flattened stretch of sand you may draw a distinction on the blackboard you may draw one in the air it wasn't there until you made it and it can disappear again in the same sense a system where there are some specific kinds of interactions can draw such a distinction and that's what you see in these models which of course require more thought and I can't resist the the natural thought that comes from looking at this bit of you might say artificial life you would like to create a next level from some simple way of stating a principle and allowing it to go for the interactions of the proto cells but I think that that's not obvious here what the next step should be and we're down at the very beginnings of artificial life historically and otherwise and I'm certainly not going to start talking about other automata that produce what's people artificial life then another aspect of recursion our beautiful self similar geometric forms that emerge from very simple distinctions and recursive processes involved and we know these but I feel like putting them putting some of the pictures in front of us like this is some some depth search into the Mandelbrot set some particular thing and and the rules that are behind this are deeply are very simple they're just multiplying complex numbers just squaring something adding something but the form you get is extremely complex and cryptic and you would you would look at it and try to describe it and find yourself at sea in in some form of observation how is that connected with the rules that generated it you know how it is by the program but how is it how can you make a connection with that in a more direct way I don't know higher dimensional analogues of these kind of recursions give us some insight into nature of space and time I can think of geometries sprouting out of geometries and so on just ideas I care to mention or the kind of recursions and beautiful geometries that come out of things in biological systems but I want to talk about things that are as simple as possible and there we will find ourselves back looking at laws of form what is the nature of a distinction that's the question and in a mathematical sense there's no definition because a definition in mathematics is a certain form of distinction and Spencer Brown begins suffer French Li he says we take the idea of distinction we take as given the idea of distinction and that one cannot make an indication without drawing a distinction we take therefore the form of distinction for the form and then on those first pages of laws of form you find the word the words about distinction in definition such as definition distinction is perfect countenance but that's not a definition in the mathematical sense it's circular and it is a statement of a word for distinction definition and then some other words which you can interpret as you will and the first page goes on like a dictionary of many words for distinction placed in some forms that have the appearance of English sentences."

      "text": "There are only some small you know I can't do that now there are only some small arrows up near the black a a bumping into the in black circles the cube is is something you made for sure and you it's a Necker cube and you can see it either way and you notice that if you clear to stare at it a little bit longer or here or here or here this artist is relying on something hidden in your brain or hidden in your perception and also here so you are making all of those distinctions in interaction with some things that are perhaps given what's the nature of a distinction we make distinctions or we imagine that we make distinctions a circle makes a distinction in the plane between its inside and that it's outside we draw a circle and so make a distinction finding a circle we agree that it is a distinction we see that the circle makes a difference between its inside and its outside we see that for us the circle indicates a difference between its inside and its outside a circle could be a symbol standing for a distinction the circle could be a symbol it could be written outside the circle of the original distinction and become its name the symbol can make a distinction with our help a symbol can be the name and in the primordial event of a distinction that is the NA firstness the distinction is its own name so in Spencer browns loss of form these these remarks crystallize into the laws of calling and the laws of and the law of crossing and the law of calling each circle can be regarded as the name of the other and so erased and in the law of grossing you cross from the state indicated by the mark to the unmarked State Spencer Browns calculus is inherently self-referential the mark stands for a distinction and can be seen to stand for the distinction made by the mark itself the mark is assigned for itself in the sense of Charles Sanders purse and one could stay there and think semiotic elite for a long time without making any calculate I think that is a very interesting place we know that this goes on into a mathematical form but if you're only thinking about the properties of signs and indications as purse was in his talking about that kind of thing then you can stay here and and notice that you we do have a sign for itself which looked like the end of a huge recursion in the way purse talked about it but this sign is simply a sign for itself there and there alone and one can think about that play with that and then the law of crossing I wanted to express it in a few lines this way a distinction fitting into itself recognizes that what it is is identical with what it is not and so the distinction disappears primordial distinction is its own name i included this slide and then I realized I'm talking with Tom post that he's talking about Douglas Harding's notion that you have no head the singularity for you as a as an observer in the space is not over here like in Asher's picture the singularity is here and it's strange to view Asher's picture as a displacement of Douglas Harding's absent head strange enough so that some mathematicians got hold of this picture of Escher and decided to fill in the void with a fractal reenactment of the entire picture within itself and make a movie of it which I won't show you but it's available you may find it somewhere we may begin with distinctions that describe other distinctions but they soon will be describing themselves now I want to talk about a specific thing this is our a specific model like the auto poiesis model due to Joelle Isaacson about recursive distinguishing and it's very simple and what's surprising about it is that how much it how much comes out of it given its simplicity use you begin with a row of letters and you look at each letter and you ask whether it is the same or different from the letters on either side of it and if it is equal to the letters on either side of it you put underneath the letter in equal sign if it is equal to the one on the left and unequal to the one on the right you put a bar a little vertical bar on your equal sign on the right to indicate different and you put a little vertical bar on the left if it's different on the left and if it's different in both cases I sometimes draw a circle or a little box so so let's recurse here and see what happens I used a circle instead of a box to indicate different so I started with a little field of of entities with one singularity in the middle one distinction in the middle V is distinct from the A's on either side of it and now we perform the description of the distinction so the observer who is doing this from our from using Dirk's language as a second-order observer he is examining the distinctions that the previous characters make and all the A's up to a point are equal to their neighbors and then we come to an A which is unequal to the B that is on its right from my point of view and you get a bracket going that way and then you have B which is unequal to its neighbors and then you have a which is equal to its right neighbor and you'll get another bracket and then lots of equal signs and now we do it again because we're going to do this again and again and wherever you start with you end up with just the icons and then the icons are recursing on themselves so you can start with anything and then you begin with a series of icons and the icons are made out of indicators for the distinctions that the previous icons made in fact you can think of the upper and lower parts as saying it's different from the outside so at the next stage all the A's are equal up to a point but then bump into we I'm sorry the equal signs are all equal up to a point and then we bump into an equal sign which has somebody different on the on on his right and a bracket occurs and then we have unequal unequal unequal and then another bracket and then all equal signs it opened up a little and then we go again and this time we get this bracket circle bracket form and then we get an equals a kind of space between them and another bracket circle bracket form so you get you you gave birth to a form on the first line and then that form opened itself up a little bit and reproduced itself on the next line so one of the very first things that happens from a singularity or a distinction in this model is the birth of a something which can reproduce itself that seems to be a lot for from very little and so I recommend thinking about this model and for that reason single distinction this I said everything I just said here yeah mitosis occurred here's a more complicated arrangement now we're in two dimensions and each of these funny little symbols is the icon the icon with the icon that's a full box says I'm different from all my neighbors from the previous time not necessarily right now and the one that looks like a laws of farm mark says I'm different from this and I'm different from this but I'm equal to that and I'm equal to that and as you see you'll get more out laws of form marks all over the place and different orientations it also gets some single lines and you will get blank there's 16 of them in this alphabet the icons become a 16 I con alphabet and this is something that happened after cursing for a long time it in in the next step it becomes this and in the next step becomes this it's order to each of these two complex forms describes the other one many many such periodic forms will arise in the course of you are playing with this if you by hand or with a computer not necessarily ordered to but order to came up kind of frequently they would go on and on and on and then Oh it's oscillating between these two entities that describe each other hmm so there's a there's a an arena for some exploration and we've been playing with that we imagine more complex into examples of interaction for example you can consider a car any conversation and how each person transforms the language of the other in in a sequence of recursive moves and I think that's not such a good choice of language since I don't want to think about recursive at this point I'm what I told you that I would worry about my time as I'm going to quickly skip across some slides and if I see one that I want to make a comment on I I'll say something Russell's paradox in the diagrammatic form of a curl curling on itself a set curling on itself in becoming an eigen form for membership asset belonging to itself DNA is knotted and can undergo recursion and the DNA recursion looks like this a Watson and a crick strand and opened up by the environment opened up into the environment by enzyme action the environment provides a Crick strand to Watson and a Watson strand Crick and the DNA replicates which is very similar to the replication form here where the little protocell opened up and then the environment as it were supplied though the ingredients for making two of them now we're at the last point and I want to talk about what comes from the re-entry the infinite reentry form or the process of reentry that we're from you have the reentering mark and you keep reentering it and evaluating across time or you get the spatial eigen form it's the cross time part that I want to think about if you just looked at what got entered you see you have mark state then you have mock state within it mark state within it and these alternate of course between mocked and unmarked because each time the mark State goes in it vanishes and then it appears again the reentering mark is an imaginary value in spencer brown's discussion of imaginary value where there is some temporality and a something at a given time creates a change that moves it to something that happens at the next time in his discussion of imaginary value he points to internal workings of his circuits and says here here the imaginary value operates and if you look into those circuits you see that it meant that at just the right time in the action of the circuit a mark appeared which was able to influence as though the circuit observed it south the transition to a next state and then maybe that MOC disappeared so the reentering mark is is the an exemplar of that kind of imaginary value and we perhaps over study it but that's what I'm doing here so I'm I'm using zero for the mark state one for the unmarked state and there is the oscillation and then I wish to look at it as two views the view that it is oscillating from zero to one P and the view that is oscillating from one to zero q and I wish to think of P and Q not necessarily as static entities but also as time sensitive entities and if P is time sensitive and it interacts with P then it takes a moment for P to interact with P and one of the P's ends up becoming a Q because in time P and Q go back and forth to one another P becomes Q q becomes P the time shift the time frame shifts from 1 2 1 0 from 0 1 2 1 0 so that P as a time-sensitive entity act interacts with itself as P interacting with Q but if P interacts with Q point to point you have 0 interacting with 1 and 1 interacting with 0 you have 0 0 you have the marked State only and so we can make time-sensitive entities by adding another symbol sorry for a lot of mathematics at the very end the symbol is non commutative on one side of something it you will see the something a B and the symbol ADA and aa and if you shift data across time happens and you turned into B a so ADA on both sides of a B becomes B a a B becomes time sensitive by I'll stop by finishing my little talk here for a minute the so you and you star are the time sensitive versions of P and Q and then you can calculate the an algebraic pattern that comes out of the recursion if you let you interact with itself you see P flips to Q as I said and Q interacting with P is 0 on the other hand if you let you interact with you star Y then the Q gets flipped to a P and you get P uu star is P itself U star U is Q itself and uu star plus U star U is P plus Q which is just 1 1 which is 1 so you have this pattern U squared is 0 U star square root is 0 and u U star plus U star U is equal to 1 that is the algebra usually associated with a fermion particle so we see that this kind of pattern is coming up out of very nearly nothing just the distinction and the oscillation I have not used any higher forms of arithmetic I haven't used plus 1 or minus 1 I'm just using the font of the mark let's skip that slide and skip this one but point out this one this is the kind of distinction we just discovered an upstate of down state are getting interchanged by you and you star the crossing now has a directionality you go from upstate to downstate by you or you star but you can't you have to use the right one because if you use the wrong one you go to the void so this is a special kind of distinction near the first distinction now that we've been talking about that comes out of the oscillation and you might write it in terms of a containment calculus where you have a couple of new ones left and right ones and they are square roots of negation similar in a way to what our colleagues made with one square root of negation and they interact non commutative Li I want to make the final remark that if we now go to arithmetic we're taking another step up and it's quite different and what happens in arithmetic in arithmetic you are plus one and minus one and you think - is negation but in arithmetic zero is in the middle and minus zero is zero so zero is self referential zero is like the reentering mark you when you go up to arithmetic you're actually going up into a calculus of imaginary values from the point of view of loss of form it's a big step arithmetic is way beyond way up here quite a distance from from just the zero and the one and yet if we accept arithmetic and play the game then we could take the difference between P and Q and we would have the oscillation between minus one and one and we would land on the square root of minus one and other algebras that are also related to physics but I must stop [Applause] and the oscillation between the unmarked state and the marked state can be certainly thought of in that way as the unmarked state is the hole and the mark status as particularity locality and hardness yeah yes I didn't mean to interrupt you but also become alongside and the system could reduce and in exploring we are often looking at parts and trying to get them back into the hole instead of swallowing the elephant's we're trying to find that whether it is an elephant yeah other comments yeah certainly there are slides on the indicative shift whether I kept them in here I don't think oh I did there yeah well that's not crated I yeah no matter let's talk about the indicative shift yes something that I've been working like half a page it was Hamish well that all these things have this kind of pattern that if you or maybe this well this will help right I have this entity gremlin over here which when it end rats with a duplicate say and puts it in a box and that's an oculist enough just duplicate say inputs it in a box but but if if a gremlin meets a gremlin then the gremlin makes two copies of a gremlin and puts it in a box and now we have two copies of a gremlin interacting with one another and they will do it again being REM lie and and so this goes on forever it it sits inside itself for or it does the recursion so this this curious notational thing is is fundamentally related to the idea of a reflexive domain where every element in the domain can interact with every other element in the domain to produce a new element of the domain that is to say every element of the domain is a transformation of the domain and we have no stops on what constitutes an entity i if i am an entity and you're an entity then we in conversation become an entity we become one of Dirks catches and and it goes on forever in that way in the end of the domain in is full of self interaction and interaction with others and then and then this sort of thing can happen of course because the entity can interact with itself a new entity can be the one that does something with the self interaction and so fixed points will occur again forms will occur they are just part and parcel of reflexivity and then of things like hurdles theorem end and and shifts of self reference are are actually formally very similar to this and rather than change formalisms in mid I'll just stay with this but we can talk about the other things yeah then lambda calculus yes this is this is a tiny course in lambda calculus that slide I'm sorry yeah there there yeah oh that's given right as part of the situation that an X can interact with itself yes so so of course that from from that later point of view long after the green capilla Mathematica and Russell's paradox and so on when church and curry began to think about these kind of things they said well we'll allow it will allow things to interact with themselves and and produce domains in which this could happen and then there are many mathematical difficulties with such domains but it's very natural and computer people think it's very natural because if you write a program you could certainly let it interact with other programs and you can give it a name so so the what is the difficulty the the difficulty seems to be that mathematicians have a have a passion for putting everything into an eternal category and and then things that are fundamentally temporal don't fit very well into eternal categories and so then we get lots of interesting technical work to do because of that if in order to define what sensations oh I say you couldn't possibly make a definition of a distinction here could only indicate something about it and and explore I cannot say I can say I mean a domain in which there is no no no distinction between things Adam you may have things which are distinct but there's no distinction between them like these are both hands of mine but they are distinct they're ones left and ones right now that that's Maxwell's version of the law of crossing in fact right that the distinction and I mean that's what's beautiful about lost form it goes backward and forward the the the form of distinction fitting into itself removes the distinction because that seam could just disappear or other people speak about it in other ways like some people speak with the Godhead as a place where there's no distinction all things are our prout are potent but not prescient yes that's right so someone is taking a situation where there's a definite a collection of relationships which are indicated by distinct which can be indicated by distinctions and then making a new field of entities which are made out of the very distinctions that were present in the in the earlier part so if we were to speak about how we converse of course if it seems to be described by that but it's more complex than than that and in some ways may be more simple than that so it's a model and from my point of view it's not everything but it's a very interesting model yes the right III inform someone tends to think of eigen forms as things like like infinitely many boxes where if you put one more around it it doesn't change and that's generalization of course of eigenvalue where one wasn't always making recursions to find the eigenvalues but one also wasn't always making recursions to make the eigen form such as I am the one who says I places I as an eigen form but it isn't that I is always thinking about I forever or in Dirk Scott Jax the the organization is is working in relation to itself but it doesn't have to go to infinity in the mathematical sense and you probably wouldn't want it to on the other hand you walk in front of a two facing mirrors and it effectively physically creates an infinity for you you have a speaker and a microphone and feedback but the feedback will infinitely sort of explode in this you have something that's contained so right right sure so as soon as you have feedback you have the question of whether it would be uncontrolled or controlled positive and negative and all those issues well it depends on what you mean by explode right if I point the mic back at the speaker and the sound is being amplified beyond my endurance then I will say oh this is uncontrolled feedback but but but but if I just think about it abstractly it's just as doing what it's doing so in the Sorcerer's Apprentice the there was uncontrolled feedback from the point of view of a Mickey Mouse and controlled by the sorcerer but but maybe you allow that an infinite number of brooms work okay yeah we're dead you're talking about shifting values in in what situation there you mean the up to up in the down and there and they're shifting back and forth but if you applied the same if you crossed and then crossed again you'd be I thought you'd be at the zero right well that's just the form of that that is the form of that but then if go back to the physical situation well energy can give rise to a pair of fermions energy can't give rise to two fermions of the same type that's Pauly's principle that's like u u equals zero then when will energy give rise to two fermions you don't you don't actually know I mean here you have the description like that and then in actual physics we it there's just if you know more nor about the physics you would have some sense of of the frequency with which pairs would be created but but but you don't have a you don't have a complete story about when those things will happen in the physics so you could have so I'm saying is you can have situations where part of it you know about and part of it you don't know that time to saw"

create a next level from some simple way of stating a principle and allowing it to go for the interactions of the proto cells but I think that that's not obvious here what the next step should be and we're down at the very beginnings of artificial life historically and otherwise and I'm certainly not going to start talking about other automata that produce what's people artificial life then another aspect of recursion our beautiful self similar geometric forms that emerge from very simple distinctions and recursive processes involved and we know these but I feel like putting them putting some of the pictures in front of us like this is some some depth search into the Mandelbrot set some particular thing and and the rules that are behind this are deeply are very simple they're just multiplying complex numbers just squaring something adding something but the form you get is extremely complex and cryptic and you would you would look at it and try to describe it and find yourself at sea in in some form of observation how is that connected with the rules that generated it you know how it is by the program but how is it how can you make a connection with that in a more direct way I don't know higher dimensional analogues of these kind of recursions give us some insight into nature of space and time I can think of geometries sprouting out of geometries and so on just ideas I care to mention or the kind of recursions and beautiful geometries that come out of things in biological systems but I want to talk about things that are as simple as possible and there we will find ourselves back looking at laws of form what is the nature of a distinction that's the question and in a mathematical sense there's no definition because a definition in mathematics is a certain form of distinction and Spencer Brown begins suffer French Li he says we take the idea of distinction we take as given the idea of distinction and that one cannot make an indication without drawing a distinction we take therefore the form of distinction for the form and then on those first pages of laws of form you find the word the words about distinction in definition such as definition distinction is perfect countenance but that's not a definition in the mathematical sense it's circular and it is a statement of a word for distinction definition and then some other words which you can interpret as you will and the first page goes on like a dictionary of many words for distinction placed in some forms that have the appearance of English sentences as you know what is the nature of a distinction in your interaction with a something in your world you find that you make many distinctions and I've chosen a few images that are that I happen to like for the way in which one interacts visually making one distinction and then another and then another and then another in these forms now this is a Necker computer register every Necker cube is either forward or back moves from state to state and and here is imaginary value in the visual form there is no cube its virtual entirely virtual there are only some small you know I can't do that now there are only some small arrows up near the black a a bumping into the in black circles the cube is is something you made for sure and you it's a Necker cube and you can see it either way and you notice that if you clear to stare at it a little bit longer or here or here or here this artist is relying on something hidden in your brain or hidden in your perception and also here so you are making all of those distinctions in interaction with some things that are perhaps given what's the nature of a distinction we make distinctions or we imagine that we make distinctions a circle makes a distinction in the plane between its inside and that it's outside we draw a circle and so make a distinction finding a circle we agree that it is a distinction we see that the circle makes a difference between its inside and its outside we see that for us the circle indicates a difference between its inside and its outside a circle could be a symbol standing for a distinction the circle could be a symbol it could be written outside the circle of the original distinction and become its name the symbol can make a distinction with our help a symbol can be the name and in the primordial event of a distinction that is the NA firstness the distinction is its own name so in Spencer browns loss of form these these remarks crystallize into the laws of calling and the laws of and the law of crossing and the law of calling each circle can be regarded as the name of the other and so erased and in the law of grossing you cross from the state indicated by the mark to the unmarked State Spencer Browns calculus is inherently self-referential the mark stands for a distinction and can be seen to stand for the distinction made by the mark itself the mark is assigned for itself in the sense of Charles Sanders purse and one could stay there and think semiotic elite for a long time without making any calculate I think that is a very interesting place we know that this goes on into a mathematical form but if you're only thinking about the properties of signs and indications as purse was in his talking about that kind of thing then you can stay here and and notice that you we do have a sign for itself which looked like the end of a huge recursion in the way purse talked about it but this sign is simply a sign for itself there and there alone and one can think about that play with that and then the law of crossing I wanted to express it in a few lines this way a distinction fitting into itself recognizes that what it is is identical with what it is not and so the distinction disappears primordial distinction is its own name i included this slide and then I realized I'm talking with Tom post that he's talking about Douglas Harding's notion that you have no head the singularity for you as a as an observer in the space is not over here like in Asher's picture the singularity is here and it's strange to view Asher's picture as a displacement of Douglas Harding's absent head strange enough so that some mathematicians got hold of this picture of Escher and decided to fill in the void with a fractal reenactment of the entire picture within itself and make a movie of it which I won't show you but it's available you may find it somewhere we may begin with distinctions that describe other distinctions but they soon will be describing themselves now I want to talk about a specific thing this is our a specific model like the auto poiesis model due to Joelle Isaacson about recursive distinguishing and it's very simple and what's surprising about it is that how much it how much comes out of it given its simplicity use you begin with a row of letters and you look at each letter and you ask whether it is the same or different from the letters on either side of it and if it is equal to the letters on either side of it you put underneath the letter in equal sign if it is equal to the one on the left and unequal to the one on the right you put a bar a little vertical bar on your equal sign on the right to indicate different and you put a little vertical bar on the left if it's different on the left and if it's different in both cases I sometimes draw a circle or a little box so so let's recurse here and see what happens I used a circle instead of a box to indicate different so I started with a little field of of entities with one singularity in the middle one distinction in the middle V is distinct from the A's on either side of it and now we perform the description of the distinction so the observer who is doing this from our from using Dirk's language as a second-order observer he is examining the distinctions that the previous characters make and all the A's up to a point are equal to their neighbors and then we come to an A which is unequal to the B that is on its right from my point of view and you get a bracket going that way and then you have B which is unequal to its neighbors and then you have a which is equal to its right neighbor and you'll get another bracket and then lots of equal signs and now we do it again because we're going to do this again and again and wherever you start with you end up with just the icons and then the icons are recursing on themselves so you can start with anything and then you begin with a series of icons and the icons are made out of indicators for the distinctions that the previous icons made in fact you can think of the upper and lower parts as saying it's different from the outside so at the next stage all the A's are equal up to a point but then bump into we I'm sorry the equal signs are all equal up to a point and then we bump into an equal sign which has somebody different on the on on his right and a bracket occurs and then we have unequal unequal unequal and then another bracket and then all equal signs it opened up a little and then we go again and this time we get this bracket circle bracket form and then we get an equals a kind of space between them and another bracket circle bracket form so you get you you gave birth to a form on the first line and then that form opened itself up a little bit and reproduced itself on the next line so one of the very first things that happens from a singularity or a distinction in this model is the birth of a something which can reproduce itself that seems to be a lot for from very little and so I recommend thinking about this model and for that reason single distinction this I said everything I just said here yeah mitosis occurred here's a more complicated arrangement now we're in two dimensions and each of these funny little symbols is the icon the icon with the icon that's a full box says I'm different from all my neighbors from the previous time not necessarily right now and the one that looks like a laws of farm mark says I'm different from this and I'm different from this but I'm equal to that and I'm equal to that and as you see you'll get more out laws of form marks all over the place and different orientations it also gets some single lines and you will get blank there's 16 of them in this alphabet the icons become a 16 I con alphabet and this is something that happened after cursing for a long time it in in the next step it becomes this and in the next step becomes this it's order to each of these two complex forms describes the other one many many such periodic forms will arise in the course of you are playing with this if you by hand or with a computer not necessarily ordered to but order to came up kind of frequently they would go on and on and on and then Oh it's oscillating between these two entities that describe each other hmm so there's a there's a an arena for some exploration and we've been playing with that we imagine more complex into examples of interaction for example you can consider a car any conversation and how each person transforms the language of the other in in a sequence of recursive moves and I think that's not such a good choice of language since I don't want to think about recursive at this point I'm what I told you that I would worry about my time as I'm going to quickly skip across some slides and if I see one that I want to make a comment on I I'll say something Russell's paradox in the diagrammatic form of a curl curling on itself a set curling on itself in becoming an eigen form for membership asset belonging to itself DNA is knotted and can undergo recursion and the DNA recursion looks like this a Watson and a crick strand and opened up by the environment opened up into the environment by enzyme action the environment provides a Crick strand to Watson and a Watson strand Crick and the DNA replicates which is very similar to the replication form here where the little protocell opened up and then the environment as it were supplied though the ingredients for making two of them now we're at the last point and I want to talk about what comes from the re-entry the infinite reentry form or the process of reentry that we're from you have the reentering mark and you keep reentering it and evaluating across time or you get the spatial eigen form it's the cross time part that I want to think about if you just looked at what got entered you see you have mark state then you have mock state within it mark state within it and these alternate of course between mocked and unmarked because each time the mark State goes in it vanishes and then it appears again the reentering mark is an imaginary value in spencer brown's discussion of imaginary value where there is some temporality and a something at a given time creates a change that moves it to something that happens at the next time in his discussion of imaginary value he points to internal workings of his circuits and says here here the imaginary value operates and if you look into those circuits you see that it meant that at just the right time in the action of the circuit a mark appeared which was able to influence as though the circuit observed it south the transition to a next state and then maybe that MOC disappeared so the reentering mark is is the an exemplar of that kind of imaginary value and we perhaps over study it but that's what I'm doing here so I'm I'm using zero for the mark state one for the unmarked state and there is the oscillation and then I wish to look at it as two views the view that it is oscillating from zero to one P and the view that is oscillating from one to zero q and I wish to think of P and Q not necessarily as static entities but also as time sensitive entities and if P is time sensitive and it interacts with P then it takes a moment for P to interact with P and one of the P's ends up becoming a Q because in time P and Q go back and forth to one another P becomes Q q becomes P the time shift the time frame shifts from 1 2 1 0 from 0 1 2 1 0 so that P as a time-sensitive entity act interacts with itself as P interacting with Q but if P interacts with Q point to point you have 0 interacting with 1 and 1 interacting with 0 you have 0 0 you have the marked State only and so we can make time-sensitive entities by adding another symbol sorry for a lot of mathematics at the very end the symbol is non commutative on one side of something it you will see the something a B and the symbol ADA and aa and if you shift data across time happens and you turned into B a so ADA on both sides of a B becomes B a a B becomes time sensitive by I'll stop by finishing my little talk here for a minute the so you and you star are the time sensitive versions of P and Q and then you can calculate the an algebraic pattern that comes out of the recursion if you let you interact with itself you see P flips to Q as I said and Q interacting with P is 0 on the other hand if you let you interact with you star Y then the Q gets flipped to a P and you get P uu star is P itself U star U is Q itself and uu star plus U star U is P plus Q which is just 1 1 which is 1 so you have this pattern U squared is 0 U star square root is 0 and u U star plus U star U is equal to 1 that is the algebra usually associated with a fermion particle so we see that this kind of pattern is coming up out of very nearly nothing just the distinction and the oscillation I have not used any higher forms of arithmetic I haven't used plus 1 or minus 1 I'm just using the font of the mark let's skip that slide and skip this one but point out this one this is the kind of distinction we just discovered an upstate of down state are getting interchanged by you and you star the crossing now has a directionality you go from upstate to downstate by you or you star but you can't you have to use the right one because if you use the wrong one you go to the void so this is a special kind of distinction near the first distinction now that we've been talking about that comes out of the oscillation and you might write it in terms of a containment calculus where you have a couple of new ones left and right ones and they are square roots of negation similar in a way to what our colleagues made with one square root of negation and they interact non commutative Li I want to make the final remark that if we now go to arithmetic we're taking another step up and it's quite different and what happens in arithmetic in arithmetic you are plus one and minus one and you think - is negation but in arithmetic zero is in the middle and minus zero is zero so zero is self referential zero is like the reentering mark you when you go up to arithmetic you're actually going up into a calculus of imaginary values from the point of view of loss of form it's a big step arithmetic is way beyond way up here quite a distance from from just the zero and the one and yet if we accept arithmetic and play the game then we could take the difference between P and Q and we would have the oscillation between minus one and one and we would land on the square root of minus one and other algebras that are also related to physics but I must stop [Applause] and the oscillation between the unmarked state and the marked state can be certainly thought of in that way as the unmarked state is the hole and the mark status as particularity locality and hardness yeah yes I didn't mean to interrupt you but also become alongside and the system could reduce and in exploring we are often looking at parts and trying to get them back into the hole instead of swallowing the elephant's we're trying to find that whether it is an elephant yeah other comments yeah certainly there are slides on the indicative shift whether I kept them in here I don't think oh I did there yeah well that's not crated I yeah no matter let's talk about the indicative shift yes something that I've been working like half a page it was Hamish well that all these things have this kind of pattern that if you or maybe this well this will help right I have this entity gremlin over here which when it end rats with a duplicate say and puts it in a box and that's an oculist enough just duplicate say inputs it in a box but but if if a gremlin meets a gremlin then the gremlin makes two copies of a gremlin and puts it in a box and now we have two copies of a gremlin interacting with one another and they will do it again being REM lie and and so this goes on forever it it sits inside itself for or it does the recursion so this this curious notational thing is is fundamentally related to the idea of a reflexive domain where every element in the domain can interact with every other element in the domain to produce a new element of the domain that is to say every element of the domain is a transformation of the domain and we have no stops on what constitutes an entity i if i am an entity and you're an entity then we in conversation become an entity we become one of Dirks catches and and it goes on forever in that way in the end of the domain in is full of self interaction and interaction with others and then and then this sort of thing can happen of course because the entity can interact with itself a new entity can be the one that does something with the self interaction and so fixed points will occur again forms will occur they are just part and parcel of reflexivity and then of things like hurdles theorem end and and shifts of self reference are are actually formally very similar to this and rather than change formalisms in mid I'll just stay with this but we can talk about the other things yeah then lambda calculus yes this is this is a tiny course in lambda calculus that slide I'm sorry yeah there there yeah oh that's given right as part of the situation that an X can interact with itself yes so so of course that from from that later point of view long after the green capilla Mathematica and Russell's paradox and so on when church and curry began to think about these kind of things they said well we'll allow it will allow things to interact with themselves and and produce domains in which this could happen and then there are many mathematical difficulties with such domains but it's very natural and computer people think it's very natural because if you write a program you could certainly let it interact with other programs and you can give it a name so so the what is the difficulty the the difficulty seems to be that mathematicians have a have a passion for putting everything into an eternal category and and then things that are fundamentally temporal don't fit very well into eternal categories and so then we get lots of interesting technical work to do because of that if in order to define what sensations oh I say you couldn't possibly make a definition of a distinction here could only indicate something about it and and explore I cannot say I can say I mean a domain in which there is no no no distinction between things Adam you may have things which are distinct but there's no distinction between them like these are both hands of mine but they are distinct they're ones left and ones right now that that's Maxwell's version of the law of crossing in fact right that the distinction and I mean that's what's beautiful about lost form it goes backward and forward the the the form of distinction fitting into itself removes the distinction because that seam could just disappear or other people speak about it in other ways like some people speak with the Godhead as a place where there's no distinction all things are our prout are potent but not prescient yes that's right so someone is taking a situation where there's a definite a collection of relationships which are indicated by distinct which can be indicated by distinctions and then making a new field of entities which are made out of the very distinctions that were present in the in the earlier part so if we were to speak about how we converse of course if it seems to be described by that but it's more complex than than that and in some ways may be more simple than that so it's a model and from my point of view it's not everything but it's a very interesting model yes the right III inform someone tends to think of eigen forms as things like like infinitely many boxes where if you put one more around it it doesn't change and that's generalization of course of eigenvalue where one wasn't always making recursions to find the eigenvalues but one also wasn't always making recursions to make the eigen form such as I am the one who says I places I as an eigen form but it isn't that I is always thinking about I forever or in Dirk Scott Jax the the organization is is working in relation to itself but it doesn't have to go to infinity in the mathematical sense and you probably wouldn't want it to on the other hand you walk in front of a two facing mirrors and it effectively physically creates an infinity for you you have a speaker and a microphone and feedback but the feedback will infinitely sort of explode in this you have something that's contained so right right sure so as soon as you have feedback you have the question of whether it would be uncontrolled or controlled positive and negative and all those issues well it depends on what you mean by explode right if I point the mic back at the speaker and the sound is being amplified beyond my endurance then I will say oh this is uncontrolled feedback but but but but if I just think about it abstractly it's just as doing what it's doing so in the Sorcerer's Apprentice the there was uncontrolled feedback from the point of view of a Mickey Mouse and controlled by the sorcerer but but maybe you allow that an infinite number of brooms work okay yeah we're dead you're talking about shifting values in in what situation there you mean the up to up in the down and there and they're shifting back and forth but if you applied the same if you crossed and then crossed again you'd be I thought you'd be at the zero right well that's just the form of that that is the form of that but then if go back to the physical situation well energy can give rise to a pair of fermions energy can't give rise to two fermions of the same type that's Pauly's principle that's like u u equals zero then when will energy give rise to two fermions you don't you don't actually know I mean here you have the description like that and then in actual physics we it there's just if you know more nor about the physics you would have some sense of of the frequency with which pairs would be created but but but you don't have a you don't have a complete story about when those things will happen in the physics so you could have so I'm saying is you can have situations where part of it you know about and part of it you don't know that time to saw"

        "text": "She was born in Switzerland in 1954 and passed away in London in nineteen 2018 this is a picture of the cover of the thesis which she published herself in her prints led editions book were publishing a venture I thought I would give her a few few words to begin the talk these are a couple of excerpts from the thesis I won't read all of it I just will read a little bit of it but in trying to speak about language I found that I had to remove distinctions successive distinctions excessive distinctions we seem to think it pointless to remove distinctions if there is perhaps a point in saying the things I say it is as the naive child protesting about the cumbersome ways grown-ups have of going about things cumbersome ways which a saint Cooper II of the child found to make such grownups blind to the simplicity of things when he drew his drawing number one it was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant I don't need to read the rest about things in constructing of the observer and his construction are won and cannot be distinguished I'll leave it at that and take you to the end of laws of form where Spencer Brown says we see now that the first distinction the mark and the observer are not only interchangeable but in the form identical this is a kind of sentence that Spencer Brown wrote which sometimes is looked at and seen as a very mystical statement but it can also be the most concrete thing that you could say about language and the observer as well and and those modalities all interact as you read laws of form again and again or think about these matters again and again next topic this is about part of the work of Varela Montano and a rebei in their well-known paper on auto polices and what they did was they took a an abstract chemical substrate a catalyst star which if it has some chemical neighbors which I'll just call circles combines to become neighbors that can be bound together and the binding can occur over time and there is decay all of these recursive constructions that I mention as I will mention many recursive constructions as we go along fit Dirk's principles very well about form and decay you can think about that in relation to this that the ones that combine decay after some time back into the ordinary ones and so what happens when you begin with a catalyst in in a soup like that is that the bindings begin to form in the neighborhood of the catalyst and naturally out of the geometry of this situation the bindings form a circle and become a boundary which creates a protocell out of the distinctions that are present so that a new distinction arises the new distinctions arise the proto cells with their boundaries out of other forms of distinction that are pressed in the substrate so this is the process of auto police's that they illustrated here and it is a very interesting and important image about how distinctions arise from distinctions in the course of recursion and in the course of this kind of construction you can make modern versions of this so in the model the elemental distinctions interact to produce a new distinction the protocell in the plane that maintains its distinctive structure in the course of the recursion of the molecular interactions of course it when you start to look at models like this you you will feel like oh well I I don't they don't want maybe to start with a whole collection of pre-processed distinctions to begin with why shouldn't all the distinctions be arising and and then you find yourself exploring further to see whether that might be the case and in any case in the making of a distinction the distinction was not there until it was made you may draw a circle in a tied flattened stretch of sand you may draw a distinction on the blackboard you may draw one in the air it wasn't there until you made it and it can disappear again in the same sense a system where there are some specific kinds of interactions can draw such a distinction and that's what you see in these models which of course require more thought and I can't resist the the natural thought that comes from looking at this bit of you might say artificial life you would like to

the one on the left and unequal to the one on the right you put a bar a little vertical bar on your equal sign on the right to indicate different and you put a little vertical bar on the left if it's different on the left and if it's different in both cases I sometimes draw a circle or a little box so so let's recurse here and see what happens I used a circle instead of a box to indicate different so I started with a little field of of entities with one singularity in the middle one distinction in the middle V is distinct from the A's on either side of it and now we perform the description of the distinction so the observer who is doing this from our from using Dirk's language as a second-order observer he is examining the distinctions that the previous characters make and all the A's up to a point are equal to their neighbors and then we come to an A which is unequal to the B that is on its right from my point of view and you get a bracket going that way and then you have B which is unequal to its neighbors and then you have a which is equal to its right neighbor and you'll get another bracket and then lots of equal signs and now we do it again because we're going to do this again and again and wherever you start with you end up with just the icons and then the icons are recursing on themselves so you can start with anything and then you begin with a series of icons and the icons are made out of indicators for the distinctions that the previous icons made in fact you can think of the upper and lower parts as saying it's different from the outside so at the next stage all the A's are equal up to a point but then bump into we I'm sorry the equal signs are all equal up to a point and then we bump into an equal sign which has somebody different on the on on his right and a bracket occurs and then we have unequal unequal unequal and then another bracket and then all equal signs it opened up a little and then we go again and this time we get this bracket circle bracket form and then we get an equals a kind of space between them and another bracket circle bracket form so you get you you gave birth to a form on the first line and then that form opened itself up a little bit and reproduced itself on the next line so one of the very first things that happens from a singularity or a distinction in this model is the birth of a something which can reproduce itself that seems to be a lot for from very little and so I recommend thinking about this model and for that reason single distinction this I said everything I just said here yeah mitosis occurred here's a more complicated arrangement now we're in two dimensions and each of these funny little symbols is the icon the icon with the icon that's a full box says I'm different from all my neighbors from the previous time not necessarily right now and the one that looks like a laws of farm mark says I'm different from this and I'm different from this but I'm equal to that and I'm equal to that and as you see you'll get more out laws of form marks all over the place and different orientations it also gets some single lines and you will get blank there's 16 of them in this alphabet the icons become a 16 I con alphabet and this is something that happened after cursing for a long time it in in the next step it becomes this and in the next step becomes this it's order to each of these two complex forms describes the other one many many such periodic forms will arise in the course of you are playing with this if you by hand or with a computer not necessarily ordered to but order to came up kind of frequently they would go on and on and on and then Oh it's oscillating between these two entities that describe each other hmm so there's a there's a an arena for some exploration and we've been playing with that we imagine more complex into examples of interaction for example you can consider a car any conversation and how each person transforms the language of the other in in a sequence of recursive moves and I think that's not such a good choice of language since I don't want to think about recursive at this point I'm what I told you that I would worry about my time as I'm going to quickly skip across some slides and if I see one that I want to make a comment on I I'll say something Russell's paradox in the diagrammatic form of a curl curling on itself a set curling on itself in becoming an eigen form for membership asset belonging to itself DNA is knotted and can undergo recursion and the DNA recursion looks like this a Watson and a crick strand and opened up by the environment opened up into the environment by enzyme action the environment provides a Crick strand to Watson and a Watson strand Crick and the DNA replicates which is very similar to the replication form here where the little protocell opened up and then the environment as it were supplied though the ingredients for making two of them now we're at the last point and I want to talk about what comes from the re-entry the infinite reentry form or the process of reentry that we're from you have the reentering mark and you keep reentering it and evaluating across time or you get the spatial eigen form it's the cross time part that I want to think about if you just looked at what got entered you see you have mark state then you have mock state within it mark state within it and these alternate of course between mocked and unmarked because each time the mark State goes in it vanishes and then it appears again the reentering mark is an imaginary value in spencer brown's discussion of imaginary value where there is some temporality and a something at a given time creates a change that moves it to something that happens at the next time in his discussion of imaginary value he points to internal workings of his circuits and says here here the imaginary value operates and if you look into those circuits you see that it meant that at just the right time in the action of the circuit a mark appeared which was able to influence as though the circuit observed it south the transition to a next state and then maybe that MOC disappeared so the reentering mark is is the an exemplar of that kind of imaginary value and we perhaps over study it but that's what I'm doing here so I'm I'm using zero for the mark state one for the unmarked state and there is the oscillation and then I wish to look at it as two views the view that it is oscillating from zero to one P and the view that is oscillating from one to zero q and I wish to think of P and Q not necessarily as static entities but also as time sensitive entities and if P is time sensitive and it interacts with P then it takes a moment for P to interact with P and one of the P's ends up becoming a Q because in time P and Q go back and forth to one another P becomes Q q becomes P the time shift the time frame shifts from 1 2 1 0 from 0 1 2 1 0 so that P as a time-sensitive entity act interacts with itself as P interacting with Q but if P interacts with Q point to point you have 0 interacting with 1 and 1 interacting with 0 you have 0 0 you have the marked State only and so we can make time-sensitive entities by adding another symbol sorry for a lot of mathematics at the very end the symbol is non commutative on one side of something it you will see the something a B and the symbol ADA and aa and if you shift data across time happens and you turned into B a so ADA on both sides of a B becomes B a a B becomes time sensitive by I'll stop by finishing my little talk here for a minute the so you and you star are the time sensitive versions of P and Q and then you can calculate the an algebraic pattern that comes out of the recursion if you let you interact with itself you see P flips to Q as I said and Q interacting with P is 0 on the other hand if you let you interact with you star Y then the Q gets flipped to a P and you get P uu star is P itself U star U is Q itself and uu star plus U star U is P plus Q which is just 1 1 which is 1 so you have this pattern U squared is 0 U star square root is 0 and u U star plus U star U is equal to 1 that is the algebra usually associated with a fermion particle so we see that this kind of pattern is coming up out of very nearly nothing just the distinction and the oscillation I have not used any higher forms of arithmetic I haven't used plus 1 or minus 1 I'm just using the font of the mark let's skip that slide and skip this one but point out this one this is the kind of distinction we just discovered an upstate of down state are getting interchanged by you and you star the crossing now has a directionality you go from upstate to downstate by you or you star but you can't you have to use the right one because if you use the wrong one you go to the void so this is a special kind of distinction near the first distinction now that we've been talking about that comes out of the oscillation and you might write it in terms of a containment calculus where you have a couple of new ones left and right ones and they are square roots of negation similar in a way to what our colleagues made with one square root of negation and they interact non commutative Li I want to make the final remark that if we now go to arithmetic we're taking another step up and it's quite different and what happens in arithmetic in arithmetic you are plus one and minus one and you think - is negation but in arithmetic zero is in the middle and minus zero is zero so zero is self referential zero is like the reentering mark you when you go up to arithmetic you're actually going up into a calculus of imaginary values from the point of view of loss of form it's a big step arithmetic is way beyond way up here quite a distance from from just the zero and the one and yet if we accept arithmetic and play the game then we could take the difference between P and Q and we would have the oscillation between minus one and one and we would land on the square root of minus one and other algebras that are also related to physics but I must stop [Applause] and the oscillation between the unmarked state and the marked state can be certainly thought of in that way as the unmarked state is the hole and the mark status as particularity locality and hardness yeah yes I didn't mean to interrupt you but also become alongside and the system could reduce and in exploring we are often looking at parts and trying to get them back into the hole instead of swallowing the elephant's we're trying to find that whether it is an elephant yeah other comments yeah certainly there are slides on the indicative shift whether I kept them in here I don't think oh I did there yeah well that's not crated I yeah no matter let's talk about the indicative shift yes something that I've been working like half a page it was Hamish well that all these things have this kind of pattern that if you or maybe this well this will help right I have this entity gremlin over here which when it end rats with a duplicate say and puts it in a box and that's an oculist enough just duplicate say inputs it in a box but but if if a gremlin meets a gremlin then the gremlin makes two copies of a gremlin and puts it in a box and now we have two copies of a gremlin interacting with one another and they will do it again being REM lie and and so this goes on forever it it sits inside itself for or it does the recursion so this this curious notational thing is is fundamentally related to the idea of a reflexive domain where every element in the domain can interact with every other element in the domain to produce a new element of the domain that is to say every element of the domain is a transformation of the domain and we have no stops on what constitutes an entity i if i am an entity and you're an entity then we in conversation become an entity we become one of Dirks catches and and it goes on forever in that way in the end of the domain in is full of self interaction and interaction with others and then and then this sort of thing can happen of course because the entity can interact with itself a new entity can be the one that does something with the self interaction and so fixed points will occur again forms will occur they are just part and parcel of reflexivity and then of things like hurdles theorem end and and shifts of self reference are are actually formally very similar to this and rather than change formalisms in mid I'll just stay with this but we can talk about the other things yeah then lambda calculus yes this is this is a tiny course in lambda calculus that slide I'm sorry yeah there there yeah oh that's given right as part of the situation that an X can interact with itself yes so so of course that from from that later point of view long after the green capilla Mathematica and Russell's paradox and so on when church and curry began to think about these kind of things they said well we'll allow it will allow things to interact with themselves and and produce domains in which this could happen and then there are many mathematical difficulties with such domains but it's very natural and computer people think it's very natural because if you write a program you could certainly let it interact with other programs and you can give it a name so so the what is the difficulty the the difficulty seems to be that mathematicians have a have a passion for putting everything into an eternal category and and then things that are fundamentally temporal don't fit very well into eternal categories and so then we get lots of interesting technical work to do because of that if in order to define what sensations oh I say you couldn't possibly make a definition of a distinction here could only indicate something about it and and explore I cannot say I can say I mean a domain in which there is no no no distinction between things Adam you may have things which are distinct but there's no distinction between them like these are both hands of mine but they are distinct they're ones left and ones right now that that's Maxwell's version of the law of crossing in fact right that the distinction and I mean that's what's beautiful about lost form it goes backward and forward the the the form of distinction fitting into itself removes the distinction because that seam could just disappear or other people speak about it in other ways like some people speak with the Godhead as a place where there's no distinction all things are our prout are potent but not prescient yes that's right so someone is taking a situation where there's a definite a collection of relationships which are indicated by distinct which can be indicated by distinctions and then making a new field of entities which are made out of the very distinctions that were present in the in the earlier part so if we were to speak about how we converse of course if it seems to be described by that but it's more complex than than that and in some ways may be more simple than that so it's a model and from my point of view it's not everything but it's a very interesting model yes the right III inform someone tends to think of eigen forms as things like like infinitely many boxes where if you put one more around it it doesn't change and that's generalization of course of eigenvalue where one wasn't always making recursions to find the eigenvalues but one also wasn't always making recursions to make the eigen form such as I am the one who says I places I as an eigen form but it isn't that I is always thinking about I forever or in Dirk Scott Jax the the organization is is working in relation to itself but it doesn't have to go to infinity in the mathematical sense and you probably wouldn't want it to on the other hand you walk in front of a two facing mirrors and it effectively physically creates an infinity for you you have a speaker and a microphone and feedback but the feedback will infinitely sort of explode in this you have something that's contained so right right sure so as soon as you have feedback you have the question of whether it would be uncontrolled or controlled positive and negative and all those issues well it depends on what you mean by explode right if I point the mic back at the speaker and the sound is being amplified beyond my endurance then I will say oh this is uncontrolled feedback but but but but if I just think about it abstractly it's just as doing what it's doing so in the Sorcerer's Apprentice the there was uncontrolled feedback from the point of view of a Mickey Mouse and controlled by the sorcerer but but maybe you allow that an infinite number of brooms work okay yeah we're dead you're talking about shifting values in in what situation there you mean the up to up in the down and there and they're shifting back and forth but if you applied the same if you crossed and then crossed again you'd be I thought you'd be at the zero right well that's just the form of that that is the form of that but then if go back to the physical situation well energy can give rise to a pair of fermions energy can't give rise to two fermions of the same type that's Pauly's principle that's like u u equals zero then when will energy give rise to two fermions you don't you don't actually know I mean here you have the description like that and then in actual physics we it there's just if you know more nor about the physics you would have some sense of of the frequency with which pairs would be created but but but you don't have a you don't have a complete story about when those things will happen in the physics so you could have so I'm saying is you can have situations where part of it you know about and part of it you don't know that time to saw"
