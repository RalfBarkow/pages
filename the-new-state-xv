Mr. [[Roscoe Pound]] has opened a new future for America by his exposition of modern law, an exposition which penetrates and illuminates every department of our thought.  Let us speak briefly of this modern theory of law.  It is: (1) that law is the outcome of our community life, (2) that it must serve, not\nindividuals, but the community. >> law",

The old\nconception of law was that \"new situations are to be met always by\ndeductions from old principles.\"  The new school (headed by\nJhering) believe that \"law is a product of conscious and\nincreasingly determinate human will.\"  \"Legal doctrines and legal\ninterests do not work themselves out blindly, but have been\nfashioned by human wants to meet human needs.\"  Before Jhering the\ntheory of law had been individualistic; Jhering's is a social\ntheory of law.  \"The eighteenth century conceived of law as\nsomething which the individual invoked against society; ... Jhering\ntaught that it was something created by society through which the\nindividual found a means of securing his interests, so far as\nsociety recognized them.\"  And Jhering called his a jurisprudence\nof realities; he wanted legal precepts worked out and tested by\nresults.  For instance, if a rule of commercial law were in\nquestion, the search should be for the rule which best accords with\nand gives effect to sound business practice [1].",

The gradual progress away from contract in\nlegal theory is just the gradual recognition of this principle. \nYou can have a contractual relation between two wills or you can\nhave those two wills uniting to form one will.

But to many the personality of\nthe corporation is a fiction: they do not consider the corporation\na self-created entity but a state-created entity.  To others,\nfollowing Gierke, the corporation is merely a state_recognized_\nentity, it has the inherent power to create itself.  The increasing\nacceptance of this latter theory has made it possible to hold\nliable groups which have not been legally incorporated but which\nexercise powers analogous to those of corporations.

Thus in shortening the hours of work the courts can no longer say this is an \"unwarrantable interference\" with individual liberty; they have to consider the health of the individual in its relation to his family and his work, also the use he will make of his leisure, the need he has for time to perform his duties as citizen, etc. etc.  Mr. Pound points out with great clearness that relation is taking the place of contract in modern law.  Workman's compensation arises from the theory of reciprocal rights and duties and liabilities which flow from a relation.  This he tells us was the common law conception until deflected by contract; now we are going back to it and we do not ask the strict terms of the contract, but what the relation demands. >> family relation contract common law conception",

Then the fundamental truth of\nrelation, that life is a web of relationships, was felt\nintuitively, but it was worked out on its personal side.  The\nfeudal age lived in the idea of relation, but the heart of the\nfeudal system was personal service.  It was like loyalty to the\nparty chief: right or wrong, the vassal followed his lord to the\nbattlefield and died with him there.  Because it was worked out on\nits personal side it had many imperfections, and the inevitable\nreaction swung far away.

The old\nconception of law was that \"new situations are to be met always by\ndeductions from old principles.\"  The new school (headed by\nJhering) believe that \"law is a product of conscious and\nincreasingly determinate human will.\"  \"Legal doctrines and legal\ninterests do not work themselves out blindly, but have been\nfashioned by human wants to meet human needs.\"  Before Jhering the\ntheory of law had been individualistic; Jhering's is a social\ntheory of law.  \"The eighteenth century conceived of law as\nsomething which the individual invoked against society; ... Jhering\ntaught that it was something created by society through which the\nindividual found a means of securing his interests, so far as\nsociety recognized them.\"  And Jhering called his a jurisprudence\nof realities; he wanted legal precepts worked out and tested by\nresults.  For instance, if a rule of commercial law were in\nquestion, the search should be for the rule which best accords with\nand gives effect to sound business practice [1].",

Thus in shortening the hours of work\nthe courts can no longer say this is an \"unwarrantable\ninterference\" with individual liberty; they have to consider the\nhealth of the individual in its relation to his family and his\nwork, also the use he will make of his leisure, the need he has for\ntime to perform his duties as citizen, etc. etc.  Mr. Pound points\nout with great clearness that relation is taking the place of\ncontract in modern law.

Because it was worked out on\nits personal side it had many imperfections, and the inevitable\nreaction swung far away.

We do not want a new legal system with every\nsunrise, but we do want a method by which our law shall be capable\nof assimilating from day to day what it needs to act upon that life\nfrom which it has drawn its existence and to which it must\nminister.  The vital fluid of the community, its life's blood, must\npass so continuously from the common will to the law and from the\nlaw to the common will that a perfect circulation will be\nestablished.  We do not \"discover\" legal principles which it then\nbehooves us to burn candles before forever, but legal principles\nare the outcome of our daily life.  Our law therefore cannot be\nbased on \"fixed\" principles: our law must be intrinsic in the\nsocial process.",
