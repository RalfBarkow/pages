Integers append the additive inverse –n. The multiplicative identity 1 is embedded as the foundation of natural numbers. Rational numbers append the multiplicative inverse 1/n. Irrational numbers have been known since the ancient Greeks however until Dedekind defined the real numbers in 1888. Irrationals such as √2, π and e, were generally limited to numbers that had a distinct geometric meaning. Algebraic numbers are roots of polynomial equations, their category is uniquely linked to the historical evolution of algebra via a fascination with solving polynomial equations during the European Renaissance."
