        "text": "---\n\nNext: [[### Provisioning - The scope of material stuff]]\nHere I’ll sketch the schools of subsistence work: the pattern families within the foprop frame that engage the real economy, provisioning material means of subsistence and wellbeing. They are framed on the basis of various kinds of relationships with stuff of various kinds. This is a frame of material and machine *forms*, organisations of (non-living and living) material that operate with the ‘suchness’ of material stuff: the objective force of material ecologies, their quality of *fiat*, not determined by or open to argumentation and preference. Stuff does what it is (internally and externally, intentionally or intrinsically) organised to do; it doesn’t debate the matter, or interpret. Stuff is a force in the world..\n\nAesthetics - preferences and intentions, prejudices and wants, human wilfulness, disparate visions - are of course tacit in an ecology of human-organised or human-inflected material stuff. Intersections with landscape §3 are inevitably at work in constituting the organisation of the §1 landscape - sometimes manifestly and powerfully so. The same is true of landscape §2. None of the constellations of stuff invoked in this structure-map operates, in practice, without being mediated in *formations* and mobilised and modulated by (aesthetic) *forces* of  affiliation (and Othering), perception (and wilful blinkers), attention (and laziness) and intention (and gut-force). Nevertheless, stuff is stuff - animal, vegetable or mineral - and handling it wisely and successfully depends very much on the kind of stuff it is.\n\nThe reason I find I’ve had to get into this kind of ‘philosophical’ stuff - ontology - on my way to the practice of a theory-of-practice arises directly from Robin, and DaO. One of the agendas of DaO was very familiar to me: post-Fordism, the mode of capitalist economy and society that has arisen on the back of the digital. It’s been at the heart of my work since, in the GLC in the 80s, we began to engage the new ground of struggle constituted by the digital: skill and de- and re-skilling, radically altered products and services and practices, ‘mass customisation’ and the Benetton mode, and the production and assembly of actual material stuff *by writing* (that is, sitting in remote locations, mediated through software tools and digital networks) and the mobilising of hugely extended machine-systems that have no human intermediation (‘disintermediation’ is a big thing in internet business models). It took a lot of adjustment, and one of the things I see clearly now that isn’t clearly addressed in DaO (it’s hard to figure) is that the digital is in fact *a new kind of stuff*. The digital - as a form of stuff - is truly radical, regardless of what any particular user happens to be doing with it.\n\nWe talk of ‘the virtual’ and of ‘immaterial’ production or products, but of course nothing exists and has force, unless it is material. The material of the digital is *written stuff* - encodings of formal conceptualisations, in/on *material* media; and (material) comms networks; and complexes of new machines - today, enormous complexes of machines (server farms, digital network switches, computational modules, ion-implanted silicon) with the size and power consumption of towns; and engineering interfaces between the new machines and the old Fordist ones: real-time systems, transducers and actuators - the apotheosis of the Fordist miracle of continuous flow production: the stuff that, as a chemical engineer, I cut my teeth on in the high-Fordist 60s. The new material not only participates in new forces of production, it also has its own distinctive *relations* of production that are not those of macro transformation of inanimate materials, nor those of (precapitalist, residual) land either. This is reason enough to get into ontology. The politics of the digital are not the politics of Fordist power (literally, power: electricals, petrol engines) and the stuff of the digital is no longer the familiar human-scale, manifest stuff of macro objects, and does not offer itself up for familiar human-scale interactions. This is not business as has been usual to this point in time.\n\nHowever radical this is, it wasn’t the aspect of DaO that first got me attending to ontology (it did seem rather familiar and I kind of took it for granted). Robin’s attention to environmental economics is widely recognised; notably, he was one of the first to engage with zero waste ::Williams 2017, Zero waste obit xxx:, Murray 1999, 2002::. And in the final section of DaO, when looking to assemble a package of policy recommendations, it’s notable that mostly they are environment-related. But this seemed odd, the policy frame seemed to somehow fall from the sky without being founded in any persistent attention to environment as a distinct ‘sphere’ in that important pamphlet, which primarily is concerned with the emergent ‘dance of provisioning’ across four grand sectors: state, market, household, mutual sector. What’s the grounding of this policy prominence, the nature of *economy, as such* (as distinct, for example, from the contingent political demands that people may be making on governments, for whatever ‘flavour of the month’, consumerist, meme-ish reason)? I had to wonder . . what is it about ‘the environment’ and ‘the digital’ that makes them - *both* of them, as a pair - radical, de facto extensions of the ‘old’ economy, leading to such a ‘new economy’ revisualisation as Robin’s? Somehow, the material of ‘the environment’ - the material nature of the environment: the planet, ecosystems, first-growth forest, ocean, the biosphere, global energy balances - has finally become *material to society and subsistence*; to trans-species survival and legacy; to wellbeing and the wellbeing of the grandchildren. The nature of ‘economy’ was now different, it had different *stuff* in it.\n\n**Schools of wild nature, domestic economy, digital means - Responses to the anthropocene, colonialism-capitalism, the golemic**\nThere is then, I think, a basic threefold division of attention in a curriculum of living economy, which maps this extended ontology of ‘material’, in which each of the divisions has a distinct material form, and with which we can have distinctly different kinds of relations; it’s an intrinsically ‘relational’ division. Expressed as schools of a college (that is, as families in a pattern language) . .\n- A school of (commoned) *wild nature* - ocean, forest, climate, weather systems, thermodynamic balance, air. Natural means that have been taken for granted as unlimited (’the bounty of nature’), whose limits of stability and carrying capacity are manifestly being transgressed, and which need actively to be brought under commons stewardship.\n- A school of (commoned) *domesticated economy* - Humanly-cultivated and -fashioned constellations of means of subsistence and wellbeing: housing and land for housing, regional food, personal care of dependents, medical care, transport, energy, etc. Each is a complex field, warranting stewarding as commons.\n- A school of (commoned) *digital means* - Digital transport infrastructure, media, apps infrastructure (platforms), protocols, generation and holding of data, devices and architectures of device networks, crunching of ‘wild’ data (‘analytics’ and Big corpora).  Free software may be produced in a commons - which is wonderful to see - but even the *use* of free software is no longer a commons (a commons of *running code*, shared data and app-deployment). This is a new kind of challenge. This school services the college too; a college has to be distributed collective, deploying digital means.\n\nIn historical terms, all of these are large and problematic fields. Our present relationship with wild nature is widely addressed now through the lens of ‘the Anthropocene’, and this is challenged: is it actually Capitalocene? Plantationocene? ::\\[Haraway xxx, Tsing xxx, others xxx]:: Does it commence in 1950 (the Bomb, a high Fordist artefact), or in the Paleolithic (settled agriculture)? This ‘sector’ is only still emergent, as a known - indeed, now *inescapable* - ‘economy’. As radicals, our relationship with ‘domesticated’ means tends to be addressed in terms of phases of capitalism - although the ‘long waves’ of techno-economic paradigms (machinofacture, Fordism, post-Fordism, etc ::\\[Perez xxx]):: are actually, historically, rather short, spanning only the historical dominance of capital, leaving open the question of whether colonisation and ‘the Plantationocene’ is an older *parallel* and precedent, or a co-emergent *part of* this mode of economic organisation. \n\nDigital means - as I implied earlier - are a distinct, emergent form of material, and discussions occur regarding the naming of the era. Rather than take the ‘x era-of-capitalism’ form (cognitive capitalism?) some will name it as a distinct kind of history, which is now in train, in the same way that the anthropocene doesn’t reduce to a phase of capitalist economy, has different kinds of material relationships at its centre and a different temporality. Some of the relations of production of the digital seem rather like those of land (raw digital territories ‘wired for sound’, appearing ‘public’ and ‘free’ but with tolls, tithes and rents exacted by oligarchic corporations; which then trade commodities of attention-production with the old economy and make old-fashioned profits). I’m inclined to regard the era of digital means as *the Golemic*: the mythical Golem was a figure of clay, animated by placing a written scroll of significant wisdom (the Torah) in its mouth. The mythical Golem was powerful but stupid, whereas ‘the Golemic’ already can discriminate and respond to patterning very finely, if intensively trained. \n\nI said it was a big historical picture! But the point is, some kind of ontology of material, and relationships with kinds of material, is arguably called for, to handle the kinds of challenges in deep evolutionary-revolutionary time that ‘living economy’ is de facto responding to.\n\nIn all the fields of material relationship above, and those below, the central concern of the schools of the college is identifying dominant relations of production, and patterns of practice that bring altered relations of production into force. In the field of ‘domesticated’ economy, some version of capital-colonial dominance and enclosure constitutes relations of production. Just how relations of production are best characterised in relationships with wild nature and with digital means are matters of ongoing enquiry, through the schools’ pattern language(ing) practice..\n\nThere are two further kinds of division that seem helpful in the landscape of material provision. The first division comprises relationships with material that are boundary-crossing (transgressive, cyborg, monstrous?) with regard to the above three. The second comprises ‘machineries’ which, while social-cultural in their material composition (just as the labour-processes of domesticated economy are), are technologies of *organising* provision and access, rather than of materially providing; and they are intended to run either as much ‘like machines’ as possible or, sometimes, *as* hugely extended (digital) machines.\n\n**Schools of transgressive and cyborg means **\nI see three boundary-crossing relationships that are problematic enough - pathological - to warrant attention in the living economy: each of them, a family of patterns, a school. First, commoning *feral nature*. This is domesticated economy that has ‘gone feral’ proving to have wild articulations well beyond those that have been cultivated and valued: atmospheric pollution, absurdly durable polymers (particulate waste plastics in oceans and the food chain), global warming. Etc. Matters of reparation are prominent here.\n\nSecond, commoning of *prosthesis*. The relationships that humans have with some means is so close that they function as prostheses, sometimes beneficially (as with contact lenses, pacemakers, artificial hips) and sometimes addictively and harmfully (as with junk foods, cosmetic surgery, ‘recreational’ drugs; and smartphones and their apps and media). There are questions about whether and in what ways these are ’needs’ or means of wellbeing: addiction, as distinct from necessity and skilful, intentional dependence. This same school could engage also with Companion species: the almost symbiotic relationships that our species has with non-human species. In both cases there are questions regarding where ‘the human’ ends and what kinds of distributed identity or existence are constructed (addictively, dependently, beneficially? inescapably? and who says?) across species and across the spectrum of human and non-living entities. These practices clearly are strongly present in landscape §3; but the de facto production of many of them is deep down in the belly of the received economy and the mechanics of available ‘stuff’ (not to mention pharmaceutical capitalism, for example), while the efficacy of some others in generating trans-species wellbeing is barely considered, and is certainly ‘not economic’ in any direct sense.\n\nA third boundary-crossing relationship is commoning  *nano*. We’ve been in the nano era for more than a century, it began with the first plastics, when molecular structures were modified or synthesised on a industrial scale, creating materials with ‘unnatural’ properties. This is the origin of the absurdly durable plastics that now are going feral. But practices of modifying and generating materials and living organisms or organs at the atomic, molecular, genetic or cellular level are set to ramp-up enormously - all the way from graphene and 3D-printed organic semiconducting fabrics, via GM crops (and patent-protected heritage species), to designer-eugenics and mood cosmetics. Human capabilities for both valuing such practices and for containing the resulting materials (*pace* plastics in the oceanic food chain, planet-wide) are far too far away from the capability to make them, for our grandchildren’s grandchildren to sleep safe at nights. This perspective sits with the ‘over the horizon and under the radar’ brief of the Faculty of stewarding, but it makes sense for the school to live alongside other materials- and provisioning-oriented families. It sits very close the the school of Digital means, for example.\n\nIn each case - the school of Feral nature, Prosthesis and symbiosis, Nano - the challenges are first, to identify relations of production in these fields of practice (often perhaps lying in landscape §3), and second to identify practical ways in which practice in relation to such means can be conducted in a *commons*: that is, under commons stewarding. It might be, for example, that some elaboration of ‘design circle’ formations is a place to start. But the movement for the commons has lots to bring to such questions, even if here we’re dealing essentially with aesthetic matters (of wellbeing) rather than subsistence.\n\n**Schools of machinery**\nThe final divisions of the material landscape involve ‘machineries’ of intermediation which are social-cultural in their material composition - that is, like the fields of domesticated economy, they manifestly are *labour processes*, existing in ‘second nature’:\n- Commoning machineries of *exchange* (for example, alternative moneys, systems of credit)\n- Commoning machineries of *provision* (logistics, operations management, openvalue networks, contribution accounting)\n- Commoning machineries of *fair trade* (cross-region trade, organised in mutuality, in the face of dramatically uneven development and powerful capitalist and colonial formations). Reparation is a major consideration; and\n- Commoning machineries of *access* to provision, notably including law, legal right and property.\nThese are technologies of intermediation; they *organise* practices of provision and access rather than themselves materially providing. In many instances they are intended to run either as much like machines as possible (rigorously *rule-based* systems of practice) or, sometimes, *as* hugely extended (digital) machines. Sometimes the rationale of rules is transparency, fairness or impartiality: an intentional absence of subjective consideration and emotional labour in the execution of an exchange, a helpful *simplification* of relationship. In all these cases of ‘machineries’  the challenge is plainly to discover how these relationships can be stewarded within commons so that contributions in the commons and the enjoying of a commons are manifestly fair and visibly *valued in actual performances* of aware practice within somehow-knowable communities, rather than being abandoned to ‘invisible hands’ and abstract ‘value’; or even, to ‘values’ and tradition."

        "text": "---\n\nNext: [[Provisioning - The scope of material stuff]]\nHere I’ll sketch the schools of subsistence work: the pattern families within the foprop frame that engage the real economy, provisioning material means of subsistence and wellbeing. They are framed on the basis of various kinds of relationships with stuff of various kinds. This is a frame of material and machine *forms*, organisations of (non-living and living) material that operate with the ‘suchness’ of material stuff: the objective force of material ecologies, their quality of *fiat*, not determined by or open to argumentation and preference. Stuff does what it is (internally and externally, intentionally or intrinsically) organised to do; it doesn’t debate the matter, or interpret. Stuff is a force in the world..\n\nAesthetics - preferences and intentions, prejudices and wants, human wilfulness, disparate visions - are of course tacit in an ecology of human-organised or human-inflected material stuff. Intersections with landscape §3 are inevitably at work in constituting the organisation of the §1 landscape - sometimes manifestly and powerfully so. The same is true of landscape §2. None of the constellations of stuff invoked in this structure-map operates, in practice, without being mediated in *formations* and mobilised and modulated by (aesthetic) *forces* of  affiliation (and Othering), perception (and wilful blinkers), attention (and laziness) and intention (and gut-force). Nevertheless, stuff is stuff - animal, vegetable or mineral - and handling it wisely and successfully depends very much on the kind of stuff it is.\n\nThe reason I find I’ve had to get into this kind of ‘philosophical’ stuff - ontology - on my way to the practice of a theory-of-practice arises directly from Robin, and DaO. One of the agendas of DaO was very familiar to me: post-Fordism, the mode of capitalist economy and society that has arisen on the back of the digital. It’s been at the heart of my work since, in the GLC in the 80s, we began to engage the new ground of struggle constituted by the digital: skill and de- and re-skilling, radically altered products and services and practices, ‘mass customisation’ and the Benetton mode, and the production and assembly of actual material stuff *by writing* (that is, sitting in remote locations, mediated through software tools and digital networks) and the mobilising of hugely extended machine-systems that have no human intermediation (‘disintermediation’ is a big thing in internet business models). It took a lot of adjustment, and one of the things I see clearly now that isn’t clearly addressed in DaO (it’s hard to figure) is that the digital is in fact *a new kind of stuff*. The digital - as a form of stuff - is truly radical, regardless of what any particular user happens to be doing with it.\n\nWe talk of ‘the virtual’ and of ‘immaterial’ production or products, but of course nothing exists and has force, unless it is material. The material of the digital is *written stuff* - encodings of formal conceptualisations, in/on *material* media; and (material) comms networks; and complexes of new machines - today, enormous complexes of machines (server farms, digital network switches, computational modules, ion-implanted silicon) with the size and power consumption of towns; and engineering interfaces between the new machines and the old Fordist ones: real-time systems, transducers and actuators - the apotheosis of the Fordist miracle of continuous flow production: the stuff that, as a chemical engineer, I cut my teeth on in the high-Fordist 60s. The new material not only participates in new forces of production, it also has its own distinctive *relations* of production that are not those of macro transformation of inanimate materials, nor those of (precapitalist, residual) land either. This is reason enough to get into ontology. The politics of the digital are not the politics of Fordist power (literally, power: electricals, petrol engines) and the stuff of the digital is no longer the familiar human-scale, manifest stuff of macro objects, and does not offer itself up for familiar human-scale interactions. This is not business as has been usual to this point in time.\n\nHowever radical this is, it wasn’t the aspect of DaO that first got me attending to ontology (it did seem rather familiar and I kind of took it for granted).
