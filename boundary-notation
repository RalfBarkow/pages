His system of mathematics has one fundamental concept, which is distinction. Distinction createsperspective by framing a space for observation,by forming the boundaries of objects, and by distinguishing objects out of an environment. Boundary notation interprets Spencer-Brown's calculus of indications spatially. This spatial interpretation denotes a distinction as a boundary, which creates a space with content (inside) distinguished from its context (outside). The content of a bounded space has no ordering; the space is inherently commutative and associative. Sorting and rearrangement of items does not change the value of the space, provided items do not cross boundaries. A boundary distinguishes content from context; crossing the boundary changes that distinction. Boundaries and space are the fundamental constructs of boundary notation."
