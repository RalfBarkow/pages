The researchers say this equals approximately 13 million malicious domains per month, representing 20.1% of all the NODs that successfully resolved."

The NOD dataset lets the researchers zoom in on the long-tail rgistered domain names, typos, and domains that are only very rarely queried on a global scale."

The researchers say that once a new NOD gets identified, the time needed for Akamai to classify it as malicious is measured in minutes&#8212;not hours or days. All of this gets done with no human intervention, which lets Akamai mitigate the new DNS threats quickly, according to the researchers."
