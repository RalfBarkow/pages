No investment in attempts to improve the performance of the piston powered, propeller airplane would match the potential of the new approach. The established approaches had reached its peak performance. Tinkering with it would produce small improvements only. The opportunity was in the new story. New organisational approaches that challenged the traditional formal structure of industry were also to increase potential of flight. Lockheed Martin's [[Skunk Works]] unleashed new levels of creativity and produced remarkable aircraft, even by today's standards."

I’ve been working in education just thirty-five years and experienced tells me the model of schooling I know so well reached its peak performance, probably decades ago. The opportunity is in a reimagined approach to learning, not tinkering with schooling. Changes in organisational approaches in education also have to go past the tinkering with efficiencies that tire those trying to find the next leap in performance."
