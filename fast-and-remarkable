That transformation was fast and remarkable. The model of schooling we know so well reached its peak performance decades ago. The opportunity is in a reimagined approach to learning, not ongoing tinkering with old models of schooling. Changes in organisational approaches in education also have to move past the tinkering."

Looking for such efficiencies is exhausting those trying to find the next incremental step up in performance, and frankly is falling well short of making the difference we desire. It’s time we appreciate how we got to the position we are now in, understand it's not what we know but how quickly we can learn that is important, and apply approaches that will greatly sped up transformation in schools.

That transformation was fast and remarkable. The model of schooling we know so well reached its peak performance decades ago. The opportunity is in a reimagined approach to learning, not ongoing tinkering with schooling. Changes in organisational approaches in education also have to move past the tinkering. "
