That manifestation of new knowledge was the jet engine. The jet took flying to faster than the speed of sound within two decades and transformed international travel. "

No investment in attempts to improve the performance of the piston powered, propeller airplane would match the potential of the new approach. The accepted technology had reached its peak performance and the status quo had been challenged. [[Focused Tinkering]] would only produce small improvements. The opportunity was in a new story for flight."

That transformation was fast and remarkable. The model of schooling we know so well reached its peak performance decades ago. The opportunity is in a reimagined approach to learning, not ongoing tinkering with schooling. Changes in organisational approaches in education also have to move past the tinkering. There are schools reimagining education that apply similar minsets."

Looking for such efficiencies is exhausting those trying to find the next incremental step up in performance, and frankly is falling well short of making the difference we desire. It is time we appreciate how we got to the position we are now in, understand its not what we know but how quickly we can learn that is important, and apply approaches that will greatly sped up transformation in schools.
