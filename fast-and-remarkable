The Orville and Wilbur Wright story is folklore, and the story of flight illustrates human capacity to innovate with remarkable speed. Within four decades of that first flight advances had enabled the production of the powerful, 700 km per hour, highly manoeuvrable P-51 Mustang fighter. It was an amazing and beautiful piece of human engineering. "

Looking for such efficiencies is exhausting those trying to find the next incremental step up in performance, and frankly not making the difference we desire. It is time we appreciate how we got to the position we are now in, understand its not what we know but how quickly we can learn that is important, and apply approaches that will greatly sped up transformation in schools.
