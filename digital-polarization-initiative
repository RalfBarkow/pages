DigiPo is spearheaded by ADP's inaugural Civic Fellow [[Mike Caulfield]] of Washington State University Vancouver. Mike serves as Washington State University Vancouver’s director of blended and networked learning and has a passion for advancing the learning of online communities and ensuring informed civic engagement. This makes him well-suited to lead this new effort and to galvanize the ADP community around advancing student civic literacy in our digital and polarized age.Together, we will work to advance student civic literacy in our digital and too often polarized age.

Doing this right, especially when you are not a content or search expert who is experienced with a wide variety of online information sources, is that students, even highly motivated ones, don't have the time or patience to do it, even after they have been given some introductory tools and procedures to do so. The real solution, in my opinion, is that these types of fact checking and critical thinking skills and techniques need to be embedded into our education systems, into disciplinary curricula, in a coordinated way from elementary through post-graduate higher ed. That is very, very hard to do, but glad your Digital Polarization project is attempting to tackle it!"
