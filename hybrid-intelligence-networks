These techniques are needed to identify the cognitive attractors structuring the information flows that characterize life in collaboratories, and enable the study of how these attractors serve as [[boundary objects]] (Star & Griesemer, 1989; Star & King, forthcoming) to articulate a wide variety of individual, and largely independent, knowledge production strategies."
