      "text": "The driver of a Tesla on Autopilot that ran a red light and killed two people in another car in 2019 faces two counts of vehicular manslaughter. Kevin George Aziz Riad, who has pleaded not guilty, appears to be the first person in the U.S. to be charged with a felony for a fatal crash involving the use of a partially automated driving system. Charges were filed by prosecutors in Los Angeles County, CA, in October, as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board continues to investigate the widespread misuse of Autopilot. The University of South Carolina's Bryant Walker Smith said Tesla could be &quot;criminally, civilly, or morally culpable&quot; if courts determine it put a dangerous technology on the road."
