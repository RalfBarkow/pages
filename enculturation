It is said that this internalisation takes time as we identify the messages and values that are consistent and reoccurring in our environment."

As a means of joining the group, fitting in or assimilating, they mirror behaviours and the culture 'catches on'. With this understanding, it might be said that culture is contagious. Importantly, it is interesting to note that constructive and destructive culture spread in the same way. "

We select research-based practices that align with our vision, values and strategic plan and  [[Griffinise]] them so that they reflect us, our nature, our school story. We create mantras, artefacts, rituals and traditions that symbolise our culture. We don’t simply take things as they are, we take them as we are. We don’t do things we’ve always done, we shift the practice in order to shift the narrative. We are active in our pursuit of the culture we envision. "

We model [[The Griffin Way]] and support them to enact it. Our ‘walking the talk’ rubs off and catches on, exemplifying the practices, the values, our culture. At Griffin, culture in our classrooms and school isn't an accident. It's consciously cultivated."
