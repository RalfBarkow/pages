To illustrate how the Jews did this, let us look a little more closely at the commandments Moses received from God: The commandment that would probably be the central one for us today, and whose non-observance today entails the most severe punishment, \"thou shalt not kill,\" follows, as is well known, only in fifth place. The first four, and this order might be found analogously in all other non-capitalistic societies, describe in the core no commandment at all, but a condition; they are commandments only insofar as they forbid to touch this condition: To be recognized as unquestionable is the existence of an All-One to whom absolute obedience is owed, an obedience which is reproduced in the relationship of the children to their parents. (\"Thou shalt honor father and mother.\") Just as this obedience corresponds to a reverence that reproduces itself just as absolutely into all the divisions of society. Obedience and worship are beyond all doubt; any doubt represents a dishonoring of God, which is the worst crime imaginable. The consequences of dishonoring this God in such societies can still be observed today, when Muslims, because of some caricatures of their Prophet, immediately go into action to execute the punishment that must necessarily follow this dishonor. And so one can still study in Islam today how every violation of honor, even between two people, is understood as a violation of God's honor, which must be atoned for by sacrifice."

In this Jewish commandment it is clearly regulated that the polytheistic practice of offering sacrifices has in principle to belong to the past. These sacrifices are, like the monotheistic God himself, completely shifted into the abstract: one offers to this God for sacrifice what one could produce on this day of rest - but just does not produce in his honor. Christianity, with the execution of Jesus, and even more so Islam with the commandment of self-sacrifice in the jihad, up to the capital - under which we also speak of traffic deaths as of sacrifices (without, however, making ourselves aware to whom we are sacrificing what for what consideration) - reintroduces this abstract sacrifice for the monotheistic God, located in the negative, as a positive into religion: this can only be characterized as regression. The historical and psychological reasons for this cannot play a role here, just as little as the religion-historical and philosophical aspects connected with it. I mention this here, because I want to deal with this moment, that of the sacrifice, in another context in a moment."

This was historically unique up to that time. All the empires that had existed before or beside them up to that time, and had likewise left tribal societies behind, organized themselves by militarily enforcing the obedience that held their empires together. Of course, they too, within the limits of their possibilities - some, the Egyptians, for example, more, others, such as the Romans, less - also made use of all kinds of religious cults in order to ideologically consolidate this obedience, but it would never have occurred to them to give themselves a god from whom the rulers would first have to derive their legitimacy. No emperor, no pharaoh, no king can recognize a power superior to him that does not prove to be superior to him only militarily."

The obedience of the Jews to their authorities was out of insight, out of reason, not out of compulsion - analogous to the Greek philosophers, who, however, even in the heyday of Athens, were only a politically insignificant minority in their societies. The Jews, on the other hand, were a people, not mere subjects of an empire, the bulk of whose energy had to be devoted to incorporating members of diverse tribes, with their mutually exclusive cults, traditions, and ruling structures, into the empire. As the Roman Empire proves, this succeeded quite well, at least at times, so well that not a few still believe today that the politics of capitalist societies can be understood as a further development of that of the Roman Empire. But this empire perished because of Christianity. Once again: How could it come to this?"
