With the Speed Bot, however, I can decide for myself where the next random walk should continue.\nI am no longer restricted to the role of spectator, as I was with the monkey.\nAnd I can finally approach the topic of graphs in a way that I can understand. I can observe the Speedbot on its journey, which I can change by modifying the source code. And this source code is itself a [[Directed Graph]]."
