[https://aclanthology.org/P03-1009.pdf pdf]\n> Previous research has demonstrated the utility of clustering in inducing semantic verb classes from undisambiguated corpus data. We describe a new approach which involves clustering subcategorization frame (SCF) distributions using the Information Bottleneck and nearest neighbour methods. In contrast to previous work, we particularly focus on clustering polysemic verbs. A novel evaluation scheme is proposed which accounts for the effect of polysemy on the clusters, offering us a good insight into the potential and limitations of semantically classifying undisambiguated SCF data.\n"

[https://aclanthology.org/W00-1325.pdf pdf]\n> Research \"into the automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames (SCFS) from corpora is starting to produce large-scale computational lexicons which include valuable frequency information. However, the accuracy of the resulting lexicons shows room for improvement. One significant source of error lies in the statistical filtering used by some researchers to remove noise from automatically acquired subcategorization frames. In this paper, we compare three different approaches to filtering out spurious hypotheses. Two hypothesis tests perform poorly, compared to filtering frames on the basis of relative frequency. We discuss reasons for this and consider directions for future research.\n"
