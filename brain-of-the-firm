      "text": "Since cybernetics is the science of control and management is the profession of control, one hardly has to justify the importance of applying the principles of the former to the performance of the latter. In undertaking this task, no one is better qualified than [[Stafford Beer]]. Given normal human limitations, few scholars can be found who are capable of both the formulation of scientific ideas and the practical application of the same. Beer, as a pioneer in the pure science of cybernetics and in its applications, is an exception to this rule. One accomplishment, however, stands above all others, and that is the contribution that Beer has made to management science. This book, combined with Cybernetics and Management (1959) and Decision and Control (1966), forms a trilogy which should serve in the future to reshape rather dramatically the development of this relatively new field of human inquiry."
