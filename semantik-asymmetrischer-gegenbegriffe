Reinhart Koselleck, Zur historisch-politischen Semantik asymmetrischer Gegenbegriffe, in: Ders, Vergangene Zukunft: Zur Semantik geschichtlicher Zeiten, Frankfurt 1979, pp. 211-259.

Another example of historically consuming distinctions is offered by the analysis of the semantics of \"counter-differentiations\" with which liberalism, since the end of the seventeenth century, took up arms against the differentiations of stratified society (families, households, clientele systems, strata).
