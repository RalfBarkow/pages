They were tasked with exploring protocols, broadly construed, from various angles and across a range of different domains. \n\nParticipants, with backgrounds spanning architecture, law, game design, technology, media, art, workplace safety, and more, each attempted to tackle an open question around protocols. Their findings comprise a variety of textual and non-textual artifacts (including art works, game designs, and software), organized around a set of research themes: built environments, danger and safety, dense hypermedia, technical standards, web content addressability, authorship, swarms, protocol death, and (artificial) memory. \n\nTheir collective output leaves us with a mix of temporal analyses, provocative hypotheses, and intriguing rabbit holes, all of which come together to form an multifaceted sketch of ‚Äúprotocols‚Äù.  Similarly to the parable of the [[Blind Men and an Elephant]], these field notes each try and describe the elusive subject from a specific vantage point.
