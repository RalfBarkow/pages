I am a nearly total cw operator and am always interested in improving my ear so after reading this article Irealized that I am one of those with the habit of deciding what the letter is before the character is finished. Consequently, it is often necessary to change my mind after the character is complete. and this takes up time so it is a definite impediment. "

It took me very little time to realize that if I actively tried to stay a letter or two behind the sender, I could hear the complete character before I had to decide what it was. This immediately gave me at least a three word per minute increase in speed with a very accurate copy. "

I am a nearly total cw operator and am always interested in improving my ear so after reading this article Irealized that I am one of those with the habit of deciding what the letter is before the character is finished. Consequently, it is often necessary to change my mind after the character is complete. and this takes up time so it is a definite impediment. "

The book provides a series of exercises and drills that are designed to help the reader gradually master each letter of the code, before moving on to more complex exercises.\n\nOne of the key features of Erwood's system is the use of audio recordings that provide a continuous stream of code at a speed that gradually increases over time. This approach is intended to simulate real-world Morse code communication, and to help the learner develop the ability to copy and send code at increasingly high speeds.\n\n"
