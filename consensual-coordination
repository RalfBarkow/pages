Interactions between organisms are spontaneous events in the ontogenetic framework of structural coupling. According to Maturana and Varela, the constitutive conditions of interaction are logically subordinate to structural coupling (Raimondi, 2014b). Interaction participates in the conservation of the invariant conditions of living, that is to say, the autopoietic organization of living being (which takes place in the domain of components) and the organism’s relation of adaptation to its medium (which takes place in the domain of the organism as a whole). Throughout the biosphere, different species have different types of interaction which generate different kinds of social phenomena that each necessarily play an important part in the construction of a particular niche. Based on this, can we identify the constitutive conditions underlying human communication and all forms of joint activity? In response, I propose a theoretical account based on the Maturanian notion of coordination. In this context, coordination is conceived of through a non-spectatorial perspective, meaning that it does not posit reflexive abilities as a prerequisite to coordination. In line with Maturana’sdefinition (Maturana, 1988), “consensual coordination” is a relational notion which refers to the process (or the result of this process) where two or more organisms interact and the interdependency of their respective operations (which may be behavioural or mental) is the spontaneous result of a specific history of interactions."

Interactions between organisms are spontaneous events in the ontogenetic framework of structural coupling. According to Maturana and Varela, the constitutive conditions of interaction are logically subordinate to structural coupling (Raimondi, 2014b). Interaction participates in the conservation of the invariant conditions of living, that is to say, the autopoietic organization of living being (which takes place in the domain of components) and the organism’s relation of adaptation to its medium (which takes place in the domain of the organism as a whole). Throughout the biosphere, different species have different types of interaction which generate different kinds of social phenomena that each necessarily play an important part in the construction of a particular niche. Based on this, can we identify the constitutive conditions underlying human communication and all forms of joint activity? In response, I propose a theoretical account based on the Maturanian notion of coordination. In this context, coordination is conceived of through a non-spectatorial perspective, meaning that it does not posit reflexive abilities as a prerequisite to coordination. In line with Maturana’sdefinition (Maturana, 1988), “consensual coordination” is a relational notion which refers to the process (or the result of this process) where two or more organisms interact and the interdependency of their respective operations (which may be behavioural or mental) is the spontaneous result of a specific history of interactions."
