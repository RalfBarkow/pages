In a September 1994 [[Journal Of Object Oriented Programming]] article he urges readers to \"use the model-view-controller framework\" and then, in the very next paragraph, he proceeds to write: \"the state diagram of a controller defines the allowable sequences of interactions inherent in a use case ... Start by assuming one controller per use case...\". So, clearly, by 1994 prominent methodologists were mis-using the paradigm's name by substituting the Jacobsonian connotation (i.e., use-case sequencer) for the Smalltalk connotation (input device interface). -- [[Randy Stafford]] (2002/04/04)",
